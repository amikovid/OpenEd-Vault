## Content Engine Refactor - ARCHIVED

**Archived to:** `Projects/_archive/_content-engine-refactor-archived-2026-01-29/`

All phases complete. Valuable parts moved:
- Sub-agent prompts → `.claude/skills/content-repurposer/references/sub-agents/`
- Architecture map → `Projects/OpenEd-Content-OS/SKILL_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`

### What Was Done

**New Skills Created:**

- `newsletter-to-social` - Router for hub-to-spoke workflow

- `archive-suggest` - Daily suggestions from content archive

- `slack-social-distribution` - Post to #market-daily as threads

- `newsletter-subject-lines` - Dedicated subject line skill (split from hook-writing)

- `article-titles` - SEO-focused headline skill (split from hook-writing)

- `work-summary` - Translate git commits to Slack-friendly updates

**Skills Refactored (8,400 words removed):**

| Skill | Reduction |
| --- | --- |
| ghostwriter | 64% |
| meta-ads-creative | 63% |
| cold-open-creator | 61% |
| hook-and-headline-writing | 59% (then split) |
| opened-daily-newsletter-writer | 37% |
| podcast-production | 29% |

**Architecture Documented:**

- `SKILL_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md` - Visual map of entire content engine

- "Examples Over Instructions" philosophy added to skill-creator

- Fixed 7 broken skill references

**Infrastructure:**

- Work summaries folder: `.claude/work-summaries/`

- Nearbound profiles: 8 updated with social handles

### Next Session Approach

**Test skills through actual workflows** rather than isolated audits:

- Run a newsletter → social spoke workflow

- Run a podcast clip extraction

- Note friction points in real use
