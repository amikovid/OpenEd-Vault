## Context
Need organic Reddit presence in r/homeschool, r/homeschooling. No direct promotion (gets flagged as spam). Google Doc playbook strategy from premortem. Build karma first, surface Curriculove organically later.

## Steps
- [ ] Create Reddit account (or identify existing)
- [ ] Subscribe to relevant subreddits
- [ ] Start contributing genuine helpful answers (2-3 per week)
- [ ] Build karma to 500+
- [ ] Create Google Doc playbook for organic discovery
- [ ] After 4+ weeks, begin mentioning Curriculove where genuinely relevant
