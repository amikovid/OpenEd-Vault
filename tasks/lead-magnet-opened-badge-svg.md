## Context
Need clean SVG badge showing "eligible for reimbursement" / "approved by OpenEd" on the 49 curricula flagged isOpenEdVendor. Source image: Ed the horse sticker (Downloads/ed-crumpled-sticker.png). Likely needs Canva tracing since source is raster with crumpled texture.

## Steps
- [ ] Open sticker image in Canva
- [ ] Trace/simplify horse + glasses to clean vector
- [ ] Use flat teal background
- [ ] Export as SVG
- [ ] Add to curriculove public/images/
- [ ] Implement badge on curriculum cards for isOpenEdVendor items
