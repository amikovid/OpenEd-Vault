title: Reddit presence — weekly thread curation + comment drafts
status: in_progress
project: opened

## Context
Strategy decided Feb 6. Three layers:
1. **Weekly curation** — Claude surfaces 3-5 Reddit threads to #market-daily with one draft comment each
2. **Make others famous** — Comments recommend real books, tools, researchers. No OpenEd links. Build Charlie's authority as the most knowledgeable person in alt-ed threads.
3. **Google Doc (future)** — A parent-voice resource guide ("Sarah wrote it") that can be casually linked. Not built yet.

### Format for #market-daily posts
Short. One thread per message in a thread under a weekly header:
- Subreddit + one-line description
- Thread URL
- One draft comment (3-5 sentences, casual, specific, lowercase)

Charlie edits to his voice and posts from his personal Reddit account.

### Target subreddits
- r/homeschool (~166K) — primary
- r/Parenting (1M+) — "should I homeschool?" threads
- r/unschool (~8K) — philosophy threads
- r/Montessori (~33K) — method comparisons
- r/ClassicalEducation (~17K) — book recs
- r/education (~176K) — policy debates

### Source material for comments (no linking, just knowledge)
- Thinker profiles: Gatto, Gray, Holt, Montessori, Illich, Greenberg
- Comparison articles: Waldorf vs Montessori, Montessori vs Reggio
- Podcast episodes: Mason Ember, Claire Honeycutt, Amar Kumar
- 400+ published articles in Master Content Index

### First batch posted
Feb 6 — 3 threads posted to #market-daily (thread 1770400735.867999). Format was too long. Trimmed format agreed on going forward.

## Steps
