## Context
Mason Pashia (Getting Smart). Active conversation Dec 2025 - relationship is warm (3 responses to 2 sent, last Dec 16). Primary keyword: "personalized learning" (1,600/mo, 0.06 competition). Article outline ready in README.md (~1,800 words target).

**Scheduled for Mar 3 deep dive + newsletter send.**

**Email status:** Two draft versions exist at `Studio/SEO Content Production/Guest Contributors/Mason Pashia/email-draft-to-mason.md`:
- **Option A:** Exploratory - asks Mason to collaborate
- **Option B (recommended):** Bold "took a liberty" approach - sends a draft article already written in Mason's voice. Charlie prefers this approach since it reduces friction for Mason.

Mason's voice: systems thinker, frameworks-oriented, speculative but grounded. Worked at Getting Smart (education innovation org).
