**Slack quotes available (6):**
- Laura Hollenbeck: "Prodigy is free and kids usually love it..." (Dec 18, 2025)
- Jessica Harter: "I would say most kids love Prodigy, but that's more of a supplement to math rather than a whole curriculum." (Jan 11, 2026)
- Chasity Soloman: "Prodigy Math always a fun one, cool math games, Math Playground, SplashLearn has a free option as well." (Jan 14, 2026)
- Daphne Gaff: "I would also encourage math games like prodigy where he can practice other skills and have fun." (Jan 22, 2026)
- Karalee Sartin: "He might enjoy Prodigy English for some extra practice that is in an immersive game world." (Jul 11, 2025)
- Rachael Davie: "I still think that Prodigy and other game style programs are great resources for reinforcement." (Sep 21, 2024)

**Primary author candidate:** Jessica Harter or Chasity Soloman (most detailed perspective on Prodigy as supplement vs curriculum)

**Key angle:** Prodigy is a supplement, not a full curriculum. Teachers love it for engagement but always pair it with a core math program. This honest framing differentiates us from generic review sites.
