## Context
OpenEd has 58 published blog posts but only ~9 are listicle/roundup format ("Best X Curriculum", "12 Best Y"). Competitor gap analysis (`Studio/SEO Content Production/competitor-gap-analysis-2026-01-30.md`) shows massive volume for "homeschool resources" (301K/mo), curriculum reviews (9K-135K/mo), and "best" roundups. We cover math and science curricula but have gaps in writing, history, foreign language, PE, art, and grade-level stacks.

Existing listicles:
- Best Homeschool Math Curriculum ✓
- Best Homeschool Science Curriculum ✓
- 12 Best Homeschool Podcasts ✓
- Free Homeschool Curriculum Guide ✓
- OpenEd Gift Guide 2025 + 2026 ✓
- Community's Favorite Resources ✓
- 9 Career Prep Strategies ✓

Major gaps (no coverage):
- Best writing curriculum
- Best history curriculum
- Best foreign language curriculum
- Best art curriculum
- Best online homeschool courses (18K/mo search volume)
- Grade-level curriculum stacks (K-12)
- Pedagogy comparison guides (Classical vs Montessori, etc.)

OpenEd's unfair advantage for listicles: real teacher voices from Slack, pedagogy matching (not just product lists), state-specific recommendations.

## Steps
- [ ] Read `Master_Content_Index.md` and catalog all existing listicle/roundup content with format notes
- [ ] Cross-reference with `competitor-gap-analysis-2026-01-30.md` keyword data
- [ ] Identify subject gaps where "Best Homeschool [X] Curriculum" articles don't exist
- [ ] Check existing tool review tasks in `tasks/` to avoid duplication
- [ ] Run `/seo-research` on top 10 candidate listicle topics to validate search volume
- [ ] Create prioritized roadmap of 10-15 listicle articles ranked by: search volume × low competition × OpenEd differentiation
- [ ] For each recommended article, note: target keyword, estimated volume, proposed structure, key products to cover
- [ ] Save output to `Studio/SEO Content Production/listicle-roadmap-20260209.md`
