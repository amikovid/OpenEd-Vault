## Context
Key feature: state-by-state funding info (ESA, scholarships, programs). Start with 9 active states (AR, IN, IA, KS, MN, MT, NV, OR, UT). Pull data from EdChoice + School Choice Awareness Foundation. Each page: funding options, OpenEd as primary CTA, link to quiz. "Powered by OpenEd" branding throughout.

## Ultimate KPI
Subscribers + applicants. Every page funnels to quiz -> email capture -> OpenEd Daily -> enrollment pipeline.

## Steps
- [ ] Research ESA/funding data for each of 9 states
- [ ] Create state page component in Next.js
- [ ] Build data model for state funding info
- [ ] Create pages for 9 active states
- [ ] Add "Browse curricula approved by OpenEd" CTA on each
- [ ] Link from quiz results to relevant state page
- [ ] Expand to all 50 states over time
