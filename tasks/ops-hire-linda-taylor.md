## Context
Linda Taylor is an editor contractor candidate. Found via Slack conversations. **Melissa has already approved budget** for a few hours of editing.

**Details:**
- Rate: $50/hr
- Proposed hours: 5 hrs/week = $1,000/month
- Already delivered solid edits on 3 Thinkers Series profiles: Montessori, Gatto, Charlotte Mason Gray
- Quality of work: proven - her edits were substantive and improved the pieces

**Role:** Last-mile editor. Claude drafts content, Linda polishes before publish. This fills the gap between AI-generated drafts and publication-ready content.

**Strategic value:** Frees Charlie from line-editing so he can focus on curriculum flywheel (the actual KPI driver). Linda handles the final 20% that takes 80% of the time.

## Steps
- [ ] Decide scope: 5 hrs/week or start smaller (3 hrs/week)?
- [ ] Formalize arrangement with Linda
- [ ] Set up Google Drive workflow for draft handoffs
- [ ] Queue first batch: Peter Gray profile, comparison articles
- [ ] Define quality checklist for Linda (anti-AI patterns, brand voice, fact-checking)
