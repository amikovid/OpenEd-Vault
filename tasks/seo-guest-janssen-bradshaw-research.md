## Context
Janssen Bradshaw (Everyday Reading blog) has **AGREED** to contribute. She's a literacy/reading expert who was a podcast guest. Her episode: "She Did Everything Right - Her Daughter Still Couldn't Read" (Dec 17, 2025).

**Scheduled for Feb 24 deep dive + newsletter send.** This means the article needs to be drafted, approved by Janssen, and ready by ~Feb 21.

**Topic direction:** "Reluctant readers" - need to find the specific high-value SEO keyword angle. Avoid dyslexia (already covered heavily in existing content). Janssen's podcast focused on her daughter's reading struggles despite doing everything "right" - great personal angle.

**Workflow:** Draft article in Janssen's voice using guest-contributor-article skill → share via Google Drive for her approval → publish Feb 24.
