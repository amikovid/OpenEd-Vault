## Context
From brain dump session. Need clear documentation of who does what and where Claude can work autonomously.

**Current team:**
| Person | Role | Rate | Hours | Focus |
|--------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Charlie | Content lead | Salary | Full-time | Strategy, curriculum, newsletter |
| Elijah | Video/ads | $35/hr | 10-15 hrs/wk | Short-form video, Meta ads, Dandelion |
| Chavilah | Podcast/social ops | ? | ? | Being trained on podcast workflow, social posting |
| Linda Taylor | Editor (proposed) | $50/hr | 5 hrs/wk | Last-mile editing, fact-checking |
| Ela | Design/Eddie Awards | ? | ? | Webflow templates, Eddie Awards, branding |
| Claude | AI assistant | N/A | Always on | Drafting, research, publishing, RSS curation |

**Claude's autonomous workflows:**
- RSS curation pipeline (fetch, filter, triage)
- Newsletter drafting (TTT format from RSS)
- Tool review drafting (from Slack quotes)
- SEO article drafting (from briefs)
- Social post generation (from hub content)
- Webflow publishing (with Charlie's approval)

**Chavilah training priorities:**
- Podcast transcript processing
- Social post scheduling
- Newsletter QA/send

## Steps
- [ ] Create team-roles.md in OpenEd Vault root
- [ ] Define "Claude can do autonomously" vs "needs Charlie approval" boundaries
- [ ] Document handoff points for each workflow
- [ ] Share with Ela and Melissa for alignment
