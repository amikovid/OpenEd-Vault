## Context
Draft v1 complete. Search volume 2,900/mo, near zero competition.

**Part of the comparison article batch.** Three other comparisons are also ready:
- Khan Academy vs IXL (1,485 words, thumbnail done)
- Saxon Math vs Math-U-See (1,607 words, thumbnail done)
- IXL vs Exact Path (1,350 words, thumbnail done)

All comparisons follow the same template: bottom line verdict, comparison table, pros/cons, teacher quotes, decision framework, FAQ. Consider batch-publishing all comparison articles together for maximum internal linking benefit.
