## Context
Project Dandelion is the paid acquisition hub with 3 pillars:

| Pillar | Target | Launch Date | Status |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Pillar 1: Known Lead Recovery** | Website visitors | Feb 16 | IN PROGRESS |
| **Pillar 2: Digital Behavior** | Website visitors + similar | March 1 | Waiting on Pillar 1 |
| **Pillar 3: Lookalike Expansion** | Lookalike audiences | March 1 | Waiting on Pillar 1 |

Pillar 1 targets website visitors with 4-6 ad variations. Must launch by Feb 16. Meta pixel validation and lead lists from CRM are dependencies. Ella owns both blockers.

## Blockers
- Meta Pixel validation (Ella) - needs verification before Pillar 2
- Lead lists for retargeting (Ella - pull from CRM)

## Steps
- [ ] Validate Meta pixel is firing correctly
- [ ] Get lead lists from CRM
- [ ] Create 4-6 ad variations (lo-fi, native-feeling per meta-ads-creative skill)
- [ ] Set up audience targeting (website visitors)
- [ ] Launch campaign
- [ ] Monitor first 48 hours
- [ ] Document results for Pillar 2/3 planning
