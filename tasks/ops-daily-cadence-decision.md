## Context
Melissa wants a daily newsletter. Charlie proposed a Pirate Wires-style **3 Quick Takes (Thought/Tool/Trend)** format that Claude can draft autonomously from the RSS curation pipeline. This keeps the CEO happy with daily cadence while minimizing Charlie's time.

**Proposed weekly structure:**
- **Mon-Wed:** 3 Quick Takes (TTT format) - Claude drafts from RSS pipeline, Charlie reviews
- **Thu:** Podcast episode newsletter
- **Fri:** OpenEd Weekly digest

**Key insight from brain dump:** Content production takes 80% of time but curriculum (Curriculove + Tools Directory) moves the actual KPIs. Newsletter should be near-zero-effort through automation so Charlie can focus on curriculum flywheel.

## Steps
- [ ] Prepare TTT format sample for Melissa (show what 3 quick takes looks like)
- [ ] Discuss with Melissa - get buy-in on daily cadence with TTT format
- [ ] Update newsletter cadence in CLAUDE.md based on decision
- [ ] Update opened-daily-newsletter-writer skill with TTT structure
