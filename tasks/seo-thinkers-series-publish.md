## Context
6 profiles drafted: Gatto, Illich, Peter Gray, Montessori, Daniel Greenberg, John Holt. Two are slotted into the February deep dive calendar:

**February/March Deep Dive Calendar:**
| Date | Topic | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Feb 10 | Competency-Based Education (Matt Bowman) | UPLOADED to Webflow as draft |
| Feb 17 | **Peter Gray** | draft-v2, ~1,850 words, needs quality loop |
| Feb 24 | Janssen Bradshaw (reluctant readers) | Awaiting guest draft |
| Mar 3 | Mason Pashia (personalized learning) | Needs email follow-up |
| Mar 10 | **Ivan Illich** | draft-v1, ~1,800 words |

**Profile readiness:**
- **Gatto:** Already live at `/blog/5369`, ranks #11.6 for "john taylor gatto" (935 impressions/mo) - DON'T change slug, update in place only
- **Peter Gray:** draft-v2 at `Thinkers Series/gray/draft-v2.md`, ~1,850 words, production-ready. Strong narrative arc, podcast quotes integrated, 5 internal links. Slightly under 2,500 word target - could expand school anxiety data or Sudbury Valley section. **Scheduled for Feb 17 deep dive + newsletter.**
- **Ivan Illich:** draft-v1 at `Thinkers/` directory, ~1,800 words. **Scheduled for Mar 10.**
- **Montessori:** Has draft. Charlie wary of publishing too soon after other Montessori-adjacent content.
- **Daniel Greenberg, John Holt:** Drafts exist, no calendar slot yet.
