# Findings & Decisions

## Requirements
- Reduce Charlie's execution load (currently working >FT hours)
- Maintain content quality across newsletters, SEO articles, podcasts
- Add video/ads capacity (Elijah)
- Add last-mile editorial capacity (Linda)
- Enable Charlie to focus on: SEO strategy, curriculove, growth architecture
- Stay within approved budget (+$1,900/mo net)

## Research Findings

### From Proposal Document
- Current team: Chavilah (20-25 hrs, $2k/mo) + Angel (12 hrs, $600-1,100/mo)
- Problem: Charlie stretched across too many execution tasks
- Proposed: Chavilah (same) + Last-Mile Editor (5-10 hrs, $1k-1.2k) + Elijah (10-15 hrs, $1.5k)

### From Melissa Meeting
- Melissa wants data on newsletter effectiveness before major changes
- Data cleanup deadline: February 10th (HubSpot enrollment status fix)
- Melissa open to Charlie restructuring role (contractor, reduced hours, etc.)
- Variable comp: Can add $2,500/half stretch goal tied to subscriber/applicant metrics
- Quote: "put together a little game plan" - Melissa wants structure doc

### From Linda Email Exchange
- Linda's edits took drafts from ~85% to 95%+ quality
- Her technical suggestions are valid (schema, site structure, categories)
- She's proactive and experienced (blog since 2010)
- She subscribed to newsletter - engaged with the mission
- Rate: $50/hr (confirmed in application, referenced in meeting)

### Charlie's Pain Points (from meeting)
- Daily newsletter: "infinite time suck" - 6-8 hrs/week for unclear ROI
- Each daily email loses ~0.8% subscribers (60-80/week across Mon-Thu)
- Feeling: "thing I spend most time on hurts my KPI most"
- Wants: orchestrating/overseeing vs. in-the-weeds execution
- Ideal: 20-25 hrs/week by Q4, "orchestrating rather than executing"

## Technical Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Linda as last-mile editor (not expanded role) | Start small, test fit, avoid scope creep |
| 5 hrs/week initial scope | Fits $1k budget, reversible if doesn't work |
| Defer Linda's technical SEO suggestions | Valid issues but different project; need Webflow coordination |
| Chavilah drafts → Linda polishes → Charlie approves | Clear handoff chain, reduces Charlie's time to 10-15 min review |

## Issues Encountered
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Newsletter ROI unclear | Waiting for Feb 10 HubSpot data cleanup |
| Charlie considering pivot to market ops | Address with Option D: start Linda, test curriculove in parallel |
