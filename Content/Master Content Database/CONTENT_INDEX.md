## How to Use This Index

In Obsidian, you can:
1. Use `[[wikilinks]]` to jump to any article
2. Use Dataview plugin for dynamic queries by date
3. Search frontmatter with `date:2026-01` to find January 2026 content

### Quick Dataview Query (if plugin installed)

```dataview
TABLE title, date, type
FROM "Content/Master Content Database"
WHERE date >= date(2026-01-01)
SORT date DESC
```
