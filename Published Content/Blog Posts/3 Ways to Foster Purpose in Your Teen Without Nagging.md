## Summary
We often think we're helping kids by asking "what is your purpose?", but research shows we're actually shutting them down. Stanford researcher Heather Malin shares 3 ways to foster purpose without the pressure—starting with stopping that one question.

Hey Eddies,

If you have a teenager, perhaps you already know the drill. You ask about their future, and they shut down. You ask what they care about, and they shrug.

According to Heather Malin, former director of research at [Stanford's Center on Adolescence](https://coa.stanford.edu/), this shouldn’t be a cause for worry.

"I could not say the word purpose around my teenager," Malin says. "She got so tired of hearing it."

We often treat purpose like a destination—a single "thing" our kids need to find to be successful. But research shows that pressure actually backfires. The stubborn-seeming response is coming from a sense of exhaustion rather than defiance.

I recently spoke with Heather and learned three research-backed ways to foster purpose without the power struggle.

Enjoy!

### 1. Stop Asking "What Is Your Purpose?"

It’s the worst question you can ask. It feels heavy, permanent, and performative.

**Try this instead:** Start small. Malin suggests asking, "What matters to you right now?" or "Who do you admire?"

Purpose isn't a lightning bolt; it's a habit of noticing what you care about. By lowering the stakes, you make it safe for them to explore.

### 2. Dig for the "Why" (Even When It's Shallow)

If your kid says, "I want to be rich," don't roll your eyes. Dig deeper.

"Underneath that desire to be wealthy is often a way they want to connect with the world," Malin explains.

Maybe they want to take care of you. Maybe they want freedom.

When you ask "why" (with genuine curiosity, not judgment), you often find a "beyond-the-self" motivation hiding inside a selfish-sounding goal. That hidden motivation is the seed of purpose.

### 3. Let Them Be Bored

We often equate purpose with passion and excitement. But Malin argues that true purpose requires the cognitive maturity to push through boredom.

"Purpose can be boring," she says. "You have to get through the parts that support whatever it is you want to do."

If we constantly entertain our kids, we rob them of the chance to develop this resilience. Let them be bored. It’s good for their prefrontal cortex.
