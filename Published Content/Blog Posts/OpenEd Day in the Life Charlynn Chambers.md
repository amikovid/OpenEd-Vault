## Summary
Stop trying to be a classroom teacher. Oregon OpenEd mom Charlynn Chambers shares her flexible method for homeschooling - weekly quotas, Dad Skills, and the 9:30 AM rule that saved her sanity.

## Content

People often ask what a "typical" day looks like for us. The honest answer? It depends on the season. But while our days vary, our rhythm stays the same.

We don't try to replicate a classroom at our kitchen table. We don't have bells. We don't do every subject every single day. Instead, we operate off a "menu."

Here's what a real Tuesday looks like in our house - chaos, canning, and all.

## 8:00 AM: The Morning Launch (and the 9:30 Rule)

I have four kids, ranging from preschool to middle school. If we don't start with structure, we don't start at all.

The first thing my kids do is check their Morning Lists on our [Skylight calendar](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=50821&awinaffid=2637072&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fmyskylight.com%2Fcalendar%2F). Before academics, we hit all of the basic human "hygiene" responsibilities:

- Brush teeth
- Brush hair
- Make beds
- Morning chores (my 4-year-old handles silverware; the 11-year-old does the heavier lifting)

**The Rule:** We have a "Hard Stop" at 9:30 AM.

Everything on that morning list needs to be done by then. If they finish at 9:00 AM? Awesome - they get 30 minutes to play before breakfast. If they drag their feet and finish at 9:29 AM? They made it, but they lost their free time.

This single rule saves my sanity. It teaches them that work comes before play - not because I said so, but because that's how time works.

## 10:00 AM: The "Menu" and The Juggle

Once breakfast is done, we open the Home Learning Profile on the Skylight.

This is where we break the traditional school mold. I don't have a rigid schedule that says "10:00 AM is Math" and "11:00 AM is History." Instead, I have a weekly quota. I want to hit History twice a week. I want to hit Science twice a week.

So we look at the menu. What do we have energy for today?

**The Split:** Teaching multiple ages is tricky. Today, my daughter had an [OpenEd](https://opened.co/) Art Club. While she was occupied with that online, I took the other two kids and we did a deep dive into History.

Currently, my son is really interested in learning about how the U.S. claimed Alaska. We didn't use a textbook for this. We looked up the real story. We talked about geography. We fell down a rabbit hole about why a state could be so far away from the rest of the country.

When I need to work one-on-one with my oldest on a complex writing assignment, the younger ones hop on [Math Basecamp](https://opened.co/) (part of OpenEd). They think they're playing a video game; I know they're drilling math facts. Everyone wins.

## 1:00 PM: "Dad Skills" and Dirty Hands

By early afternoon, we usually step away from the screens and books.

One of the specific items on our weekly menu is "Dad Skills." My husband is handy - woodworking, resin, fixing cars. We want our kids to learn that solving problems with your hands is just as important as solving them with a pencil.

Today, we're building a shop. The kids were out there helping frame the rafters. My husband was showing them how to nail the wood together, and suddenly, they were in the middle of a geometry lesson - calculating angles and counting similar sides.

He didn't even realize he was teaching math. I walked out and said, "You guys are doing Dad Skills right now."

Other days, it's Life Skills. Right now, my kitchen table is covered in bowls of apples. We're canning applesauce. The kids are peeling, measuring, and watching the preservation process. This is school, too.

## 3:00 PM: The Backup Plan (When Life Happens)

Let's be real. Sometimes I have a sore throat. Sometimes I have a meeting. Sometimes the "plan" falls apart.

I know myself well enough to know that if I don't have a safety net, I'll spiral. So we have Subject Bins.

These are magazine holders on the shelf labeled Math, Science, and Language Arts. If I can't teach a lesson, I tell the kids: "Go grab something from the bin." They might pull out a math game or a science puzzle. They're still learning, but the pressure is off me.

## 5:00 PM: The Reward Check

We end the day by checking off our stars.

We use a reward system, but with a catch: We don't celebrate learning by *not* learning.

If they earn enough stars, they can "buy" a reward. But the rewards are things like:

- **Parkour Day** (Physical Ed)
- **Accent Day** (We speak in silly accents all day - Social/Language)
- **Homemade Ice Cream** (Kitchen Chemistry)

They feel like they won a prize. I know we just added another layer to their education.

## The Takeaway

Our days aren't perfect. We have ADHD, we get distracted, and sometimes we just want to go swimming. But because we view education as a flexible menu rather than a rigid schedule, we can adapt.

*We fit the school to the life, not the life to the school.*

Used for morning chore lists (with the 9:30 AM "hard stop" rule), the "Home Learning Profile" (weekly subject menu), reward tracking (Stars system), and calendar integration for OpenEd clubs.
- **Subject Bins:** Magazine holder boxes labeled by subject (Math, Science, Language Arts) for "backup plan" learning.

### Math

- [**The Good and the Beautiful**](https://www.goodandbeautiful.com/)**:** Used primarily as a "checkpoint" to ensure no gaps (and it's free).
- [**Life of Fred**](https://lifeoffred.uniquemath.com/)**:** Used for family-style math learning.
