**How It Started**

The first several months of our homeschooling had nothing to do with curriculum. They had everything to do with drywall.

We bought a house in February 2020—excellent timing, as it turned out. By March the kids were home, theoretically doing online school, actually climbing the walls. The walls, incidentally, needed work.

So we put *our kids* to work. Measure this. Calculate that. How many tiles? What's the square footage? At first, they didn't know they were doing math. I didn't know I was homeschooling.

It took a few months for me to realize: *Oh. This is it. This is the whole thing.* Learning was happening constantly, in everyday stuff, and it was sticking. No workbook required.

We'd never considered homeschooling. Now we can't imagine going back.

## **The 10 AM Start**

These days, we're usually not fully going until about 10:00 AM.

My kids both play soccer, and their practices are almost every night—getting later as they get older. Being able to sleep in and take care of what they need has been a gift.

Before the structured part of our day, they're just starting out slow. Reading some books, doing what they want to. Sometimes they're just sitting on the couch, looking totally zoned out. It might not seem like they're using the time well, but when I check in, they're *thinking about things*. There's real value in some boredom—in moderation.

## **Morning Meeting**

Around 10:00, we sit down for what we call morning meeting:

- **Read inspirational material **together
- **10-minute news clip** — an online program that highlights what's going on in the world
- **Journal writing** — a vocabulary word of the day, or a prompted journal I got from Amazon. They choose.

After that, they break out their math curriculum (we only started using one last year—before that, no curriculum was necessary).

Once they finish math, they're kind of just turned loose to explore whatever they're interested in. By then their minds are warmed up, and it's amazing what they'll go tackle.

That's really just Monday and Tuesday, though.

## **The Rest of the Week**

- **Wednesday: Co-op.** We drive about 45 minutes because we found one we really love, and it's worth the drive. By the time we go to classes and stay to hang out with friends, it's an all-day thing.
- **Thursday: "Random clubs."** These are friend-organized. One mom runs a writing club because her kid doesn't like writing but loves friends. Another family does book club.
- **Friday: History class and Nature School.** A friend's retired-teacher dad teaches history, then we all stay and play at the park. We call it Nature School, so they're "learning something" while they run around.

Every day looks different, which keeps things fun.

## **The Wonder Wall**

As a mom, you get asked "why this, how does that work" a million times a day—and it's always at the least convenient time to actually answer.

So we have something called the [Wonder Wall](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DT040CgiuLW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).

**The setup:** A pack of sticky notes and a designated space. We had an old whiteboard that we covered with peel-and-stick wallpaper, so it looks cute on the wall. That's it.

**How it works:** When they have a question, we put it on a sticky note. Their question is validated, but I don't have to answer it right then. Later—often right after morning meeting—we'll ask, "Do you guys wanna explore one of your Wonder Wall questions?" They pick one off the wall, we grab a notebook and research it together. Draw pictures. Go deep.

**Recent questions on the wall:**

- Why do sharks have teeth?
- Do slugs have guts?
- How does a light bulb work?

I currently have transparent sticky notes, which feel really fun.

## **Hiding the Vegetables**

When my kids were younger, they loved[ Prodigy](https://www.prodigygame.com/). It's a great way to gamify math. At the ages they were really into it, they thought they were playing video games—a special privilege, extra screen time. They didn't realize they were solving math equations.

It helped that some cousins started playing around the same time. They'd FaceTime while finding each other in the same world.

We never framed it as a math thing. We'd just say, "Hey, do you wanna play Prodigy?" We never said, "You need to do your Prodigy so you can get some extra math time in."

Not to be sneaky or something. It's like putting vegetables in food—there are some veggies you can blend up that are totally unnoticeable. You don't need to tell them that the veggies are in there. You just know they're getting the nutrients.

## **Building the Village**

During COVID, we were looking for a local group. Our co-op is 45 minutes away, so we needed somebody closer to hang out with.

I don't even know how it came together. There was a random meeting at a park where someone asked, "What are you looking for in a group?" My answer was simple: my kid just wants to play. Do you want to meet at a park once a week?

We did it year-round. In the middle of winter, moms bundled up with hand warmers and warm drinks, trying not to freeze, while the kids ran around. We met every single week. I'd pick a random park and send an email—same day and time, different location.

We did that for several years before the group moved on to other things. Now it's just a few friends when we can.

Here's the thing about "it takes a village": the village doesn't just appear. I heard a quote that stuck with me: "If you want to be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager."

That's what it took—being the one who picked a park and threw out an email. It didn't cost anything beyond driving your kids to hang out with their friends.

## **What I'd Tell a New Homeschool Parent**

**Trust yourself.** You will have doubts—just realize that those doubts are normal. Even after several years, I still doubt myself.

Yes, it's your kid's future. Yes, you're making choices that will impact the rest of their lives.

But also: Who is more invested in your kid than you? Who knows your kid better?

When you're wondering if they'd be better off at school—the teacher might be amazing and love your kid too. But they're never going to love your kid the way you do.

You're doing the best you can with what you have. That's enough, because they're your kid.

**Don't do this alone.** Find friends and community. You won't click with every homeschooler, and that's fine—homeschooling has many different philosophies. Go in knowing: we don't all need to look the same. We can learn from each other because of our differences.

The relationship and the connection is the priority. Everything else seems to work out when we focus on that.

It feels almost like we're cheating the system somehow—getting to spend so many extra hours with our kids.
