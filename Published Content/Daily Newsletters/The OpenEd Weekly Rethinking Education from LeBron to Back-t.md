## Summary
4 tidbits you may have missed this week

## Content

Happy Friday!

Well, we've made it through another week of questioning everything we thought we knew about education. If you've been following along, your brain might be a bit sore from all the mental gymnastics. Don't worry, unlike Simone Biles, you won't be graded on your performance.

We've covered everything from why LeBron James would be a D student to why treating education like a one-size-fits-all commodity makes about as much sense as Spotify only offering one playlist for every subscriber.

**In this edition:**

- What if we graded LeBron like a student? 🏀
- The great unbundling of education 🎓
- Redefining "back-to-school" for open learners 🏠
- AI, edupreneurs, and brain-boosting audiobooks 🤖

Let's recap the madness, shall we?

### Grading LeBron James: A New Perspective on Academic Success

[**Matt Bowman challenged our traditional grading system**](https://opened.co/blog/beyond-a-to-f/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-opened-weekly-rethinking-education-from-lebron-to-back-to-school) with a provocative question: What if we applied academic standards to sports legends? A few data points:

- Roger Federer won 80% of matches but only 54% of points (F)
- LeBron James' all-star stats would earn mostly F's – maybe a few D’s
- Even Simone Biles' unprecedented Olympic success rate would earn her a failing grade

The lesson? Rigid grading scales often fail to capture real-world excellence. Matt introduces competency-based education (CBE) as a potential solution that better reflects the way people learn and succeed in the real world.

### The Great Unbundling: Customizing Education for the 21st Century

In [**our latest podcast episode**](https://opened.co/podcast/%f0%9f%8e%99%ef%b8%8fepisode-004-the-great-unbundling-with-michael-horn/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-opened-weekly-rethinking-education-from-lebron-to-back-to-school), Michael B. Horn, co-founder of the Clayton Christensen Institute, discusses the “unbundling” one-size-fits-all schooling is becoming obsolete.

**Highlights:**

- The daunting challenge of customizing education (and why many parents default to a single provider)
- How Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) are opening doors... but also creating decision paralysis
- Why Utah parents are more comfortable with the 'mix-and-match' approach

**The future of education is already here; it’s just unevenly distributed.**

### Redefining "Back-to-School" for Open Learners

As traditional schools gear up for fall, we explored how open educators can create meaningful transitions and learning spaces without rigid schedules.

**Ideas we loved:**

- Creating cozy reading nooks or nature observation spots
- Starting the year with educational gifts ([**homework caddy, anyone?**](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-LasiwuKG2/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=redefining-back-to-school))
- Creative ways to capture learning goals and aspirations

Remember, it's about inspiring curiosity and joy, not recreating a classroom at home.
