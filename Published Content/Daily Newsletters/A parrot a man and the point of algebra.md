## Summary
I used ChatGPT to solve an 8th grade algebra problem. Are our mental muscles atrophying - or did school just teach us wrong?

## Content

**Greetings Eddies!**

Remember that [logic puzzle](https://opened.co/blog/why-your-kid-forgets-what-they-learned-last-week) I teased in last week's Meme Monday? [The one with the parrot on the man's head](https://www.facebook.com/openedhq/posts/pfbid07W37yW7VkTEb3VdeGcpSefBK1Sh9G1mZcXibGb9cYdwYndhSSwR3wLQqSoBQwYZTl)? I promised to break it down and then promptly forgot. Let's fix that, shall we?

– Charlie *(the OpenEd newsletter guy)*

# The Puzzle

A pirate stands with a parrot on his head. We'll call him Robert (the pirate, that is - the parrot's name is Polly). When Polly stands on Robert's head, their combined height is 200 centimeters.

When Robert stands next to Polly on the ground, the difference between their heights is 170 centimeters.

So, how tall is the parrot?

Take a minute and think about how you might solve the puzzle before you scroll down.

The first time I saw the puzzle, I groped my way to the right answer in my head. The second time, to prepare this newsletter, I used ChatGPT to verify my answer and explain the “right” way to solve it.

And judging by the comments when this puzzle went viral, I wasn't alone. A lot of adults either reached for a tool, gave up, or just scrolled past entirely. Are we losing the ability to do this kind of thinking for ourselves?

This is Algebra 1: Two equations, two unknowns. We spent years mastering this in school. And yet the methods are far from second nature.

Maybe our mental muscles are atrophying - maybe having the answer always one prompt away has quietly eroded something we used to be able to do. Or maybe we never really learned it in the first place. We learned to follow procedures well enough to pass a test, but we never learned to *see* the structure of a problem. The worksheets drilled compliance, but not true comprehension.

When we [posted this puzzle on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/openedhq/posts/pfbid07W37yW7VkTEb3VdeGcpSefBK1Sh9G1mZcXibGb9cYdwYndhSSwR3wLQqSoBQwYZTl), the answers rolled in - and people got there through different paths.

Cassandra made her son do it: "He got to the answer. 15!"

Daisy worked it out with a joke: "Parrot is 15 (inches, poor tiny man).

And Hillary was more concerned with why the pirate looks like Matt Walsh (fair play, Hillary).

The "right" way to solve this is through so-called algebraic elimination. But plenty of people got there through spatial reasoning, guess-and-check, or just seeing the pattern. The path matters less than the destination - and whether your kid can find a path at all.

# The Solution (for the record)

**Here's the textbook approach. **If your kid is anywhere near algebra right now, this makes for a perfect napkin problem at dinner.

**Step 1: Name what you don't know.**

Let's call the man's height M and the parrot's height P. We're solving for either, which will give us both.

**Step 2: Translate the words into equations.**

- "Their combined height is 200" becomes: **M + P = 200**
- "The difference in their heights is 170" becomes: **M - P = 170**

**Step 3: Here's the trick - add the equations together.**

When you do that, something elegant happens. The P's cancel out:

**  M + P = 200
+ M - P = 170
-----------
2M     = 370**

Now, if you have to, you can pull out your calculator to find that M = 185. The man is 185 centimeters tall.

**Step 4: Plug back in to find the parrot.**

If M + P = 200 and M = 185, then P = 15.

Or, you can do what Bridget did and find the answer intuitively:

"2 bird-sized equal mystery spaces that must bring the total to 200 from 170" (substitute "x" for "mystery space" and you get 2x  = 30, or x = 15).

# The Point

Most people who "learned" this in school don't remember it because they memorized steps for a test instead of building intuition. Isaac Morehouse, OpenEd's CEO, [wrote about this years ago](https://opened.co/blog/i-played-with-legos-instead-of-doing-math):

"Algebra is about figuring out puzzles when you don't have all the pieces. I loved solving for X, as long as it was the X-Wing spacecraft."

He spent his childhood building LEGO instead of doing worksheets - and he was doing algebra the whole time without knowing it.

Platforms like [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/) and [Recess](https://recess.gg/) have figured this out: kids don't hate math, they hate worksheets divorced from context. When you dress the same problem up as a game or a puzzle, something clicks. The framing *is* the learning.

# Do Try This at Home

- **Give your kid the parrot puzzle.** Don't help. Let them sit with it.
- **If they're stuck:** "What do you know? What don't you know?"
- **If they're really stuck:** "What happens if you add those two things together?"

That last nudge is the whole lesson. Once they see it, they own it forever.

If your kid is struggling with algebra, maybe skip the next worksheet and hand them a parrot instead. (And if you're looking for a curriculum that builds this kind of thinking, we put together a [guide to homeschool math options](https://opened.co/blog/best-homeschool-math-curriculum).)
