## Summary
Bite-sized brain food on the future of learning: podcast highlights with Michael B. Horn, homeschooling’s rapid rise, what “unbundling” education means, and a magical demo of kid-powered AI coding.

## Content

Welcome to another edition of tl;dr (too long; didn't read) Tuesday, where we distill educational epiphanies into bite-sized brain food.

**In this edition:**

- **Podcast recap: **The hidden curriculum and the "unbundling" of education **🎙️**
- Newsweek reports on the Great Education Exodus 🏫
- **WATCH: **8-year-old coder conjures Harry Potter app in minutes 🪄

Let's dive in, shall we?

### 🎙️** The Hidden Curriculum and the "Unbundling" of Education**

**Hard truth: **Most schools might be preparing kids for a world that no longer exists.

Last week Michael B. Horn dropped some truth bombs about the future of education on the OpenEd podcast.

Missed it? Watch/listen [**here**](https://opened.co/podcast/%F0%9F%8E%99%EF%B8%8Fepisode-004-the-great-unbundling-with-michael-horn/) or read the transcript.

**Here are 3 things you need to know:**
**1/ Schools are failing at “the hidden curriculum”**
They teach math and literature, but they're missing crucial skills like project management, effective communication, and emotional intelligence - the very skills that make or break careers.
**2/ ESAs ≠ Vouchers**
Education Savings Accounts offer families a pool of money for multiple options, not just a ticket to one school. It's about customization, not just choice.
**3/ An "unbundling" of education is coming... slowly**
Unbundling in education refers to the process of breaking down traditional, all-in-one schooling into its component parts. Instead of receiving a fixed package of subjects and services from a single institution, students and families can choose from various educational options, providers, and experiences.

Horn estimates that 10 million students have access to choice options. Still, most parents start with traditional schooling before exploring alternatives.

"We talk about teamwork all the time. That's a big buzzphrase in education, ‘building teamwork.’ But We don't actually talk about how you run a meeting, how you do project management, how you coordinate team members."

– Michael B. Horn

### 🏫** The Great Education Exodus**

Newsweek reports more parents opting for homeschooling due to various concerns about traditional schooling, putting pressure on public schools to evolve or lose enrollment ([**"Why Parents Are Pulling Their Kids Out of School"**](https://www.newsweek.com/2024/08/30/why-parents-pull-kids-out-school-homeschool-1941949.html?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday)).

"Parents are seeing the value in being able to teach their own kids what they feel is necessary for them to learn."

- Arlena Brown, homeschooling mom

**Key takeaways:**

- **The Surge:** Homeschooling has exploded from 2.8% to 4.2% of U.S. students since 2019, with 50,000 new homeschoolers monthly. COVID-19 was the unexpected catalyst, exposing millions to alternative education models.
- **Safety, Satisfaction, and Personalization:** Parents seek safer environments, better educational experiences, and learning tailored to their child's needs.
- **Forget old stereotypes:** Modern homeschoolers span all demographics and backgrounds – including those traditionally underserved by conventional schools.

While homeschooling is surging in popularity, the article also highligts concerns around financial accessibility, oversight, and socialization opportunities. We hope to see more parents continue to reinvent homeschooling through the [**OpenEd**](https://opened.co) model, with resources, quality assurance, and community courses.

### 🪄** 8-Year-Old Coder Conjures Harry Potter App in <10 minutes**

Remember when we said AI won't replace humans, but empower creative problem-solvers? Well, grab your butterbeer, because we've got living proof:

Watch [**this 8-year-old develop a Harry Potter chat app**](https://x.com/bentossell/status/1826340495628324885?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) using a new AI coding copilot called [**Cursor**](https://www.cursor.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday). The video shows her building her app one feature at a time, testing and improving as she goes:

1. Conjured the words "Harry Potter" on screen (Goodbye, boring "Hello World"!)
2. Centered the text with a swish and flick
3. Added a chatbox & lightning bolt icon
4. Made the app remember the whole conversation
5. Sprinkled in a moving starry background (Hogwarts' Great Hall, anyone?)

**This is project-based learning in action.** When kids are given the freedom to explore their interests and get feedback in real time, magic happens. Whether it's coding, art, or anything in between, the key is giving them the space to experiment and create.

That's all for this edition!
