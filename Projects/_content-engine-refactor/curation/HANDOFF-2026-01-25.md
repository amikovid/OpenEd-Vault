# Curation System Handoff - 2026-01-25

## What Was Done

1. **Parsed Feedly OPML** into 4 boards:
   - Homeschool (36 feeds) → OpenEd Daily
   - AI/Marketing (16 feeds) → Skill Stack
   - Marketing/Social (14 feeds) → Skill Stack
   - Charlie Personal (15 feeds)

2. **Created project structure:**
   ```
   curation/
   ├── README.md
   ├── PLAN.md (existing)
   └── feeds/
       ├── homeschool.md
       ├── ai-marketing.md
       ├── marketing-social.md
       ├── charlie-personal.md
       └── master.opml
   ```

3. **Identified tools to integrate:**
   - [blogwatcher](https://github.com/Hyaxia/blogwatcher) - RSS monitoring CLI
   - [last30days](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill) - Reddit/X research skill

3. **Regenerate KTN addresses** for the 11 newsletters above
