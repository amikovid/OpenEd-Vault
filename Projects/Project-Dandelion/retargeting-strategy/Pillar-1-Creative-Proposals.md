# Retargeting Ad Concepts: Evidence Over Accusation

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Purpose:** Non-pushy retargeting ads for application abandoners
**Approach:** Show compelling outcomes rather than accusing parents of not finishing

---

## Strategy Summary

The Pillar 1 Creative Proposals use language that feels pushy:
- "You started exploring for a reason. That reason is still there."
- "What are you waiting for?"
- "Finish what you started"

**Better approach:** Show the outcome they want so compellingly they want to complete the application on their own.

**Format guidance from performance data:**
- Notes app format delivers best CPA ($5.33 at high volume)
- Lo-fi/native aesthetics outperform polished designs
- Specific transformation stories with concrete outcomes
- Social proof numbers (15,000+ families)
- Simple text on white background

## Ad Concepts

### Concept 1: "Curiosity Came Back"

**Format:** Notes App Screenshot
**Difficulty:** Easy

```
my kid after 2 months with OpenEd:

- asked to learn about black holes at 8pm
- built an RC car "just because"
- said "wait I want to finish this chapter"

I didn't teach motivation.
I just removed the thing killing it.
```

**Why it works:** No pressure. Just shows a transformation any parent would want. The implication is clear without saying "finish your application."

### Concept 2: "The Piano Kid"

**Format:** Text-over-video or static
**Source:** Jamie Lesko testimonial (Episode 017)

```
My 13-year-old practices piano
for 2 hours a day.

Happily.

Not because anyone makes him.

Because he finally has the time.
```

**CTA:** See how OpenEd works

**Why it works:** Specific, visual, aspirational. Parents imagine their own kid with time to pursue passions.

---

### Concept 3: "The Bell Story"

**Format:** Notes App or simple text
**Source:** Keri Mae testimonial (Episode 022)

```
When my son was in public school:
- Night terrors
- Bed wetting
- All triggered by the school bell

When we switched to OpenEd:
- Gone. All of it.

Same kid. Different environment.
```

**Why it works:** Concrete before/after. Doesn't blame the parent - blames the bell. Parents with similar kids will feel seen, not judged.

---

### Concept 4: "Three Sentences"

**Format:** Text-only static (black on white)
**Source:** Krisy Shaughnessy testimonial (In Production)

```
OpenEd asks me to submit
3-5 sentences per week
about what my kids learned.

That's it.

No curriculum pages.
No grading rubrics.
No proving myself.
```

**Why it works:** Addresses hidden fear (paperwork, compliance, being judged). Shows how easy it actually is.

---

### Concept 5: "The Whiteboard Kid"

**Format:** Notes App or TikTok response
**Source:** Keri Mae testimonial (Episode 022)

```
My 6-year-old on Zoom school:

Wrote "you are all stupid" on his whiteboard
because he already knew how to read
and they were reviewing letters.

That was my turning point.

Some kids don't need more school.
They need different school.
```

**Why it works:** Relatable frustration. The parent who started an application probably has a similar story.

---

### Concept 6: "Cheating the System"

**Format:** Text-over-video (warm family footage)
**Source:** Krisy Shaughnessy testimonial (In Production)

```
Honestly?

It feels like we're cheating the system.

We get to spend so many extra hours
with our kids.

No homework at night.
No rushing to activities.
Just... time.

17,000+ families found this too.
```

**Why it works:** Makes the outcome feel almost too good to be true - but real. No pressure, just invitation.

---

### Concept 7: "Real Funding"

**Format:** Notes App
**Source:** Charlynn Chambers testimonial (Episode 015)

```
Things OpenEd reimburses me for:
- Zoo membership
- Museum passes
- Art classes
- Curriculum supplies
- Field trips

Things I pay: $0

It's a public school partnership.
The funding already exists.
```

**Why it works:** Addresses the unspoken "can we afford this?" objection with specific evidence.

---

### Concept 8: "The Schedule Didn't Change"

**Format:** Meme or simple comparison
**Source:** Keri Mae testimonial (Episode 022)

```
My schedule:
Still working full time.

My son's schedule:
Learning at his pace.
No homework battles.
Actually happy.

I thought I had to choose.
I didn't.
```

**Why it works:** Targets working parents who abandoned their application thinking "I can't make this work."

---

### Concept 9: "Math at 10:30pm"

**Format:** Text-only static or Notes App
**Source:** Jamie Lesko testimonial (Episode 017)

```
My daughter does math at 10:30pm.

Not as punishment.

Because that's when her brain is on
and the house is quiet.

Why did we ever think
all kids learn the same way
at the same time?
```

**Why it works:** Simple observation that makes rigid schooling seem absurd. No accusation - just evidence.

---

### Concept 10: "Who Knows Your Kid Better?"

**Format:** Text-over-video (parent and child together)
**Source:** Krisy Shaughnessy testimonial (In Production)

```
A teacher might love your kid.

But they're never going to love your kid
the way you love your kid.

And no one knows what they need
better than you do.

You're more qualified than you think.
```

**Why it works:** Addresses the #1 fear (am I qualified?) with validation, not pressure.
