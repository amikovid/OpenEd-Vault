# Retargeting Strategy: FY26-27

**Primary Goal:** Recover lost pipeline and maximize ROI by re-engaging high-intent audiences
**Status:** Pillar 1 creative refined - awaiting campaign setup
**Priority:** High (Q1 2026 enrollment cycle)
**Parent Project:** [Project Dandelion](../PROJECT.md)

---

## Quick Reference

**What is this?** A three-pillar retargeting strategy to convert non-enrollees, capture website visitors, and scale via lookalikes.

**Current phase:** Pillar 1 creative refined with performance data, campaign setup next

**Key dates:**
- ~~January 19-31: Pre-launch setup~~
- February 9-15: Build Pillar 1 ads
- February 10: Enrollment tasks open
- February 16: Launch Pillar 1
- March 1: Launch Pillars 2 & 3

---

## Creative Direction: Evidence Over Accusation

**New creative direction based on historical data analysis.** See:
- `../research/meta-ads-performance-analysis-2026-01-28.md` - What works/fails

**Key finding:** "Evidence over accusation" approach outperforms. Show compelling outcomes rather than pressuring ("finish what you started"). Lo-fi, native formats deliver best CPA.

The current `Pillar-1-Creative-Proposals.md` uses this improved approach. The original pushy version is archived as `Pillar-1-Creative-Proposals-ORIGINAL.md`.

## Three-Pillar Approach

### Pillar 1: Known Lead Recovery

**Goal:** Convert parents who showed interest but never enrolled.

**Audiences:**
- 11,380 interested or applied non-enrollees from SY25-26 (6,878) and MY26 (4,502)
- Single unified Meta Custom Audience for simplified targeting

**Creative ready:** 20 concepts across 11 formats
- 6 text-only static
- 3 text-over-video
- 2 video testimonials (assets exist)
- 2 split-screen comparisons
- 2 carousels
- Plus: Notes App, Reddit post, meme, testimonial card, UGC, ad reaction

**Recommended starting set:**
1. We Saved Your Spot (text-only)
2. Cassie Shepherd (video testimonial)
3. Same Kid. Different Results. (text-only)
4. Anxiety Before/After (split-screen)
5. Drake Meme (pattern interrupt)

---

### Pillar 2: Digital Behavior Retargeting

**Goal:** Capture website visitors and ad engagers who showed interest but didn't apply.

**Audiences:**
- Website visitors
- Ad clickers and video viewers
- Social media engagers

**Creative needed:** Different messaging than Pillar 1 - these people never started an application. No "finish your application" language.

**Concept ideas (from Melissa's notes):**
1. Still Have Questions?
2. Is This Right For You?
3. Get Started in 10 Minutes
4. Other Families Just Like Yours

**Status:** Creative not started - adapt from 100-concept library when ready

---

### Pillar 3: Lookalike Expansion

**Goal:** Scale efficient acquisition by targeting audiences similar to enrolled students.

**Audiences:**
- Lookalike audiences built from 17,000+ enrolled families
- 1% lookalikes for quality, 3-5% for scale

**Creative needed:** Awareness-building for cold-ish traffic. Can pull from existing Meta Ads concepts.

**Concept ideas (from Melissa's notes):**
1. Here's Your Sign
2. Notes App format
3. Instagram Comment style

**Status:** Creative not started - adapt from 100-concept library when ready

---

## Open Questions (for Ella/Team)

1. **Landing page** - Is there a retargeting-specific page that acknowledges they started? Would convert better than standard application.

2. **Email nurture** - Who's writing the sequences that complement these ads?

3. **Video b-roll** - Some concepts need footage of parent/child learning together. Do we have this?

4. **Pillars 2 & 3 creative** - Need to adapt concepts before March 1. Different messaging than Pillar 1.
