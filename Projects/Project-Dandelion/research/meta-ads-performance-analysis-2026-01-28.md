## Top Ad Creative Breakdowns

### MG2 - Best CPA ($4.25)
**Format:** Vertical video with slow indie whistling music
**Visual:** Dim background video of kid doing science experiment (dropping fluid), text overlay as main focus
**Copy on creative:**
> "Is your child tired of learning? Tailor their school to their unique interests and strengths with OpenEd.
>
> Custom courses, creative clubs, and a focus on real life problem-solving and skills.
>
> Tap below and join the 15,000+ families that have discovered the OpenEd difference."

**Why it works:** Emotional hook ("tired of learning"), specific benefits, social proof (15k families), clear CTA

---

### Vid-TTResponse-AsADad-V1 - $5.10 CPA
**Format:** Vertical video, TikTok response style with stock images, voiceover + captions
**Hook:** On-screen TikTok comment: "Dr Phil did an episode on unschooling and I can't stop thinking about it... like maybe these alternative education people aren't crazy after all?"
**Voiceover/Caption:**
> "As a dad who was super skeptical at first, game changer alert. Found this newsletter called OpenEd daily that breaks down how families are actually making alternative education work. (including that Dr Phil family) Takes 3 min to read during my morning commute and cuts through all the education buzzwords practical stuff that actually makes sense. Tap below to subscribe."

**Why it works:** Relatable skeptic-turned-believer angle, references trending content (Dr Phil), low commitment ask (newsletter), specific time investment (3 min)

---

### Notes3 - Best Volume (747 apps at $5.33)
**Format:** Still image, iPhone Notes app screenshot style
**Copy on creative:**
> **"Interested in Homeschooling but don't know where to start?"**
>
> We've got you covered. OpenED empowers parents to customize k-13 education. Click to join over 15,000+ families.

**Why it works:** Direct question hook, addresses barrier (not knowing where to start), simple/native aesthetic, social proof

---

### Testimonial1 (and 3 more) - $5.85 CPA
**Format:** Series of square images, clean Canva-style design with parent photo and quoted testimonial
**Copy on creative:**
> "My son was really struggling with in-person public school. Then we tried OpenEd. He went from being behind in math, to leading one grade level ahead. Better yet, he had recovered his joy for learning!"
>
> "- OpenEd parent, Opening the world for every learner"

**Why it works:** Real parent story, specific transformation (behind to ahead in math), emotional payoff (joy for learning), visual credibility with photo

---

### Img-TextHeavy-V1 (and 3 more) - Highest Volume (1,278 apps)
**Format:** Square image, black text on white background
**Copy on creative:**
> "If your child is struggling in school, stop scrolling and start exploring 110+ free education resources from OpenEd. With interactive lessons and hands-on activities, OpenEd has everything you need to get your child excited to learn- all for free and easy to use. Click below to see them now."

**Why it works:** Pattern interrupt ("stop scrolling"), specific number (110+ resources), removes friction (free, easy), urgency language

## Worst Performers (High Spend, Poor Efficiency)

| Ad | Results | Spend | Cost/Result |
|-----|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Vid-SecretWeapon-V1** | 5 | $1,102 | **$220.48** |
| **Img-TextHeavy-V3 (Copy)** | 4 | $487 | **$121.77** |
| **Vid-TTResponse-Finland-V3** | 384 | $4,792 | **$12.48** |

### Vid-SecretWeapon-V1 - Worst CPA ($220.48)
**Format:** Vertical video with moody background footage of woman sipping coffee, text overlay
**Copy on creative:**
> "She had laminated schedules. I had coffee stains and confidence. She worried about Pinterest perfect photos. I thought of the moments no camera could capture. She asked my favorite curriculum. I smiled, knowing detours make the best lessons. She asked if the overwhelm ever fades. 'It doesn' I whispered, 'when you find your rhythm.' As we parted she looked hopeful. 'What's your secret?' I slid my phone across the table: 'The OpenEd Daily.' I hope we can get coffee again soon."

**Why it failed:**
- Too long and narrative-heavy - requires commitment to read through
- Abstract/poetic messaging vs. concrete benefits
- "Secret" framing creates curiosity gap but payoff (newsletter) feels anticlimactic
- No specific numbers or tangible outcomes
- Speaks to already-converted homeschoolers, not prospects considering the switch

---

### Img-TextHeavy-V3 (Copy) - $121.77 CPA
**Format:** Square image, white text on dark blue background with bright yellow circles/highlights
**Copy on creative:**
> "If your child is struggling in school, stop scrolling and start exploring 110+ free education resources from OpenEd. With interactive lessons and hands-on activities, OpenEd has everything you need to get your child excited to learn- all for free and easy to use. Click below to see them now."

**Why it failed:**
- **Exact same copy as V1** but different visual treatment
- Dark blue + yellow is busier and less native-feeling than black on white
- Bright highlights compete with the text for attention
- Looks more like a designed ad vs. V1's organic/native feel
- Proves that visual treatment matters as much as copy

---

## Key Insights

1. **MG2 is the winner** - Lowest cost per application at $4.25 with solid volume (142 results)

2. **Notes-style ads perform consistently well** - Notes3 delivered 747 applications at $5.33 each, making it the best high-volume performer

3. **Video TikTok responses are mixed** - "AsADad" version works ($5.10/app), but "Finland" and "SecretWeapon" versions underperform significantly

4. **Text-heavy images work** - Img-TextHeavy-V1 and V2 both deliver under $6/application

5. **Testimonials convert efficiently** - $5.85 per application with good CTR (1.19%)

6. **Avoid**: Vid-SecretWeapon and the Finland TikTok response - both have CPAs 2-4x higher than top performers

---

## Benchmark

**Sweet spot for cost per application:** $4.25 - $6.50

Anything above $10/application should be evaluated for pausing or iteration.

## Creative Patterns That Work

### Format Patterns
- **Notes app format** (iPhone notes aesthetic) - native, lo-fi feel
- **MG (meme/graphic) formats** - especially MG2 with atmospheric video backgrounds
- **Text-heavy static images** - V1 and V2 variants, black on white
- **Testimonial compilations** - real parent photos + specific outcomes
- **TikTok response videos** - skeptic-turned-believer narrative works

### Messaging Patterns
- **Question hooks** addressing common barriers ("don't know where to start?")
- **Pattern interrupts** ("stop scrolling")
- **Specific numbers** (110+ resources, 15,000+ families, 3 min to read)
- **Transformation stories** (struggling → thriving)
- **Low-friction CTAs** (free, easy, newsletter vs full commitment)
- **Relatable skepticism** ("as a dad who was super skeptical")

### Visual Patterns
- Lo-fi/native aesthetics outperform polished
- Text as primary visual element works
- Atmospheric background video with text overlay
- Clean, simple layouts (Canva-style for testimonials)

## Creative Patterns to Avoid

### Format Failures
- **Long narrative copy** - "Secret Weapon" storytelling feels weird and irrelevant, disconnected from prospect's actual concerns
- **Excessive visual styling** - Yellow highlights and underlines in V3 feel like corporate slop, not authentic content
- **Abstract/poetic messaging** - Metaphors about "coffee stains and confidence" don't hook or resonate

### Key Lesson: V1 vs V3 Comparison
The **exact same copy** performed 28x worse with a different visual treatment:
- V1 (black on white): $5.82/app, 1,278 results
- V3 (white on dark blue + highlights): $121.77/app, 4 results

**Takeaway:** Excessive styling destroys performance. The highlights and underlines in V3 are distracting, feel corporate, and undermine trust. Simple, clean visuals that don't scream "ad" dramatically outperform.
