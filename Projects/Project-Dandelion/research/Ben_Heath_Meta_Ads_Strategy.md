## Executive Summary

Ben Heath's Meta ads strategy is built on a simple but effective two-campaign structure (one scaling, one testing) paired with outsourced influencer/creator content production. Based on 1,200+ ad account testing and $150M+ in managed spend, this approach prioritizes creative testing velocity and leverages creator expertise to dramatically improve ad performance. Rather than requiring marketers to become video creators, the strategy focuses on hiring the right influencers and extracting maximum ad variations from their content through a tactical hook-recording technique.

## Core Strategy Framework

### The Two-Campaign Model

The foundation is deceptively simple: **one Scaling Campaign and one Testing Campaign** for the vast majority of businesses.

**Why this structure works:**

- **Scaling Campaign**: Runs your proven winners at scale. Budget allocation here depends on profitability — if results are great, allocate 70-80% of total budget here to maximize winners.

- **Testing Campaign**: Continuously tests new creative to find next-generation winners. When results are poor/unprofitable, flip the ratio and put 70-80% into testing to find winners faster.

The problem with single-campaign approaches is that Meta's algorithm locks budget onto proven performers and starves new creatives of impression share. You can't effectively test new ads alongside winners because the platform won't give new ads a real chance. By separating campaigns, you force Meta to spend testing budget on new creatives, which reveals future winners before shifting them to scale.

### Why Consolidate Audiences

Within each campaign, use **one Ad Set** targeting a mixture of cold and warm audiences together, often with open targeting or something "very close."

**The reasoning**: Meta's Suggested Audience function blends warm and cold audiences automatically anyway. Even if you try to segment them, Meta reconciles the split. You're better off consolidating data into one Ad Set so Meta's optimization algorithm has more conversion data to learn from and optimize properly.

**Exception**: Separate Ad Sets by **location only**, not by audience temperature or targeting options like interests.

## Campaign Structure

### Setup Checklist

```
Account Structure:
├── Scaling Campaign (70-80% budget when profitable)
│   └── Ad Set (cold + warm, open targeting)
│       └── Multiple Ads (creative rotations)
│
└── Testing Campaign (20-30% budget, or 70-80% when unprofitable)
    └── Ad Set (same audience mix)
        └── New creative variations (forcing test spend)
```

### Budget Allocation Logic

| Scenario | Scaling % | Testing % | Reason |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Great Results | 80 | 20 | Maximize winners while testing sustainably |
| Poor/Unprofitable | 20 | 80 | Shift resources to finding winners faster |

The key insight: don't keep spending heavily on losing ads. Use profitability to inform budget split dynamically.

## Audience Targeting Approaches

### Open Targeting (Preferred)

Use open targeting or "something very close" as your default. This allows Meta's machine learning to find the audience, not your manual targeting assumptions.

### Cold + Warm Mix

Target a mixture of:
- **Cold audiences**: People outside your existing customer/prospect list
- **Warm audiences**: Website visitors, email lists, past customers, engaged followers

Meta blends these automatically with Suggested Audiences enabled, so consolidating them into one audience gives Meta more data.

### When to Segment by Location

The only audience-level segmentation recommended: **by geography/location**. This requires separate Ad Sets when:
- Different regions have different messaging needs
- Regional profitability varies significantly
- You're testing location-specific offers

Otherwise, resist the urge to create granular micro-segments. Fewer Ad Sets = more data per Ad Set = better Meta optimization.

## Creative Strategy: The Influencer/Creator Approach

### Why Hire Creators (Not DIY)

This is described as "potentially the single most undervalued and underutilized tactic in the meta ads world."

**Key advantages:**

1. **Expertise**: Influencers became successful by being exceptional at making engaging content. You don't have to become a video expert — you leverage theirs.

2. **Audience Trust**: If an influencer's audience respects them and their recommendation carries weight, that credibility stops the scroll, holds attention, and drives conversions. Same offer, same product can move from 2x ROAS to 6x ROAS just by having the right creator present it.

3. **Cost is lower than expected**: You don't need mega-celebrities. Niche-specific influencers charge less and often move quickly on creator work. They're incentivized to do good work if they want repeat business from you.

4. **Exposure trade**: When you tell creators you'll advertise their content to millions, that's an extra selling point beyond money. They get free reach.

### Finding Creators: Meta Creator Marketplace

Meta's **Creator Marketplace** (free, under "Engage Audience" → "All Tools") makes this accessible:

- Search creators by niche/keywords
- Find creators with audiences in your target space
- Reach out and commission content directly
- Removes the friction of email outreach that previously discouraged advertisers

### What to Request from Creators

Ask creators to produce:

1. **2-3 Full Video Ads** promoting your product/service
   - Give them flexibility on messaging and approach (they know what resonates)
   - Add guidelines to prevent brand misalignment, but don't over-script
   - They're incentivized for good results because they want future work

2. **10 Hooks** (the secret multiplier tactic)
   - A hook = first 3 seconds of a video ad (opening scene + opening line)
   - Ask them to record 10 different hooks in different locations/backgrounds
   - Takes them only a few extra minutes (less than an hour typically)
   - Won't cost much more because time is still their primary pricing factor

### The Hook Economics

This is where the leverage happens:

- **Cost**: 2 full ads + 10 hooks ≈ price of 3 full ads
- **Ad variations created**: 20+ different ads (2 full ads + 10 hooks as separate ads)
- **Actual unit cost**: ~4 cents per ad instead of 1 ad at 100% cost

Why this works: Creators charge based on time, not on output. Recording 10 hooks takes minimal additional time. By combining hooks with full ads, you get 20 unique variations for roughly the price of 3.

## Tactical Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Two Campaigns

1. Create Scaling Campaign
2. Create Testing Campaign
3. Add one Ad Set to each (consolidated cold + warm audience, open targeting)

### Step 2: Identify and Hire Creators

1. Go to Meta Creator Marketplace
2. Search for creators in your niche
3. Reach out with a campaign brief outlining:
   - What your product/service does
   - Target audience
   - Desired deliverables (2 full ads + 10 hooks)
   - Budget/rate
   - Timeline

### Step 3: Request Creator Deliverables

- Specify: 2 full video ads + 10 different hooks (same creator)
- Provide brand guidelines but allow creative flexibility
- Set expectations for turnaround

### Step 4: Load Ads into Testing Campaign First

1. Create 20+ ad variations (the 2 full ads + 10 hooks, plus variations)
2. Run them all in Testing Campaign to identify winners
3. Let Meta spend budget here to surface which creatives work best

### Step 5: Move Winners to Scaling Campaign

Once you identify best performers from Testing:
1. Create scaled Ad Sets in Scaling Campaign
2. Allocate budget (70-80% when profitable)
3. Return to Testing with new creator content to repeat

### Step 6: Cycle Continuously

- Monitor fatigue on Scaling ads
- Continuously test new content in Testing Campaign
- Maintain a pipeline of next-generation creatives
- Adjust budget split based on profitability

## Optimization Tips

### Creative Testing Velocity

The core optimization principle: **test more creative variations faster**. The two-campaign structure enables this by:
- Forcing Testing Campaign spend on new ads (Meta won't starve them)
- Allowing Scaling Campaign to maximize proven winners simultaneously
- Creating a pipeline so you always have new ads ready before current ones fatigue

### The Hook Advantage

10 hooks from one creator gives you:
- Testing coverage without hiring 5+ different creators
- Quick iteration on "what hook works"
- Same creator's "voice" across variations (consistency)
- Lower cost than separately-hired content

### Budget Agility

Shift budget ratios based on profitability:
- Profitable? Maximize winners (80/20 split)
- Unprofitable? Find winners faster (20/80 split)
- This isn't a fixed plan — it's a responsive allocation

### Leverage Creator Expertise

Don't over-script or over-control creators. They're experts at engaging audiences. The businesses Heath works with that give creators flexibility see better performance than those that impose strict scripts.

## What to Avoid

### Avoid the Single Campaign Trap

Running everything in one campaign means:
- New creatives get starved of budget once winners emerge
- You can't effectively test because Meta locks budget onto winners
- Ad fatigue becomes critical because you haven't built a pipeline of next-gen creatives
- You end up in crisis mode when winners die and you have no backups

### Avoid Over-Segmentation

Don't create separate Ad Sets for:
- Cold vs. warm audiences (Meta blends them anyway)
- Interest-based targeting variations (use open targeting instead)
- Minor demographic differences

Fewer Ad Sets = more data concentration = better optimization. Only segment by location when necessary.

### Avoid DIY Video Ad Creation

The strategy explicitly rejects the idea that you need to "dedicate your entire life to becoming a video ad creator." Don't:
- Spend weeks learning video production
- Create all your own content
- Assume creator content costs "way too much"

Hire experts. It's cheaper than your time and produces better results.

### Avoid Limiting Creator Flexibility

Scripts that are too restrictive or controlling produce worse results. Avoid:
- Over-specifying exact messaging word-for-word
- Preventing creators from using their authentic voice
- Not allowing them to apply their audience knowledge

Give guidelines, not scripts. Let them do what made them successful in the first place.

### Avoid Static Budget Allocation

Don't lock in fixed 50/50 or 60/40 splits between campaigns. The strategy is responsive:
- When profitable: shift toward Scaling (80/20)
- When unprofitable: shift toward Testing (20/80)
- Adjust based on actual results, not a preset plan

### Avoid Ignoring Ad Fatigue

Scaling ad winners don't last forever. The frequency and frequency decay is real. Avoid:
- Thinking a winner will work indefinitely
- Stopping creative testing once you find winners
- Not having a pipeline of fresh content ready

The Testing Campaign ensures you always have new content being evaluated.

## Key Metrics & Benchmarks (From Heath's Experience)

- **Account base**: 1,200+ Facebook ad accounts managed
- **Total managed spend**: $150M+ over 10 years
- **Generated revenue**: $600M+ from those campaigns
- **Clients served**: 3,000+ businesses across all niches

This scale gives Heath the testing infrastructure to validate the two-campaign + creator-content approach across diverse verticals.

---

## Summary: The Framework in One Sentence

Build a two-campaign system where the Scaling Campaign maximizes proven winners while the Testing Campaign continuously searches for next-generation winners using influencer/creator content (especially 10-hook variations), adjusting budget allocation based on profitability to either scale what works or accelerate finding what works next.
