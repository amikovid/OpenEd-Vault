## Testimonial Soundbites by Theme

### Theme 1: "I Never Thought I Could Do This"

#### Jamie Lesko - Episode 017
**Timestamp: 09:43-10:02**
> "I was definitely very resistant to homeschooling. Mostly because I just didn't feel like I was qualified. I'm a teacher. I have that education. I have that background. But I felt like I was not going to be able to meet my children's needs."

**Timestamp: 13:34-13:47**
> "I can't tell you how many times I did that. I would just throw my hands in the air, 'I know you're telling me I should just homeschool my kids, but I don't think I can do that.'"

#### Keri Mae - Episode 022
**Timestamp: 05:08-05:20**
> "Because I was working full time, I just had in my head like, it's impossible, right? There's no way I could do it. I have to work."

**Timestamp: 08:27-08:35**
> "The more I learned, the more I realized this is actually accessible to me. It's going to take some creativity, but I can do it."

#### Krisy Shaughnessy - In Production
**Timestamp: 00:35-00:45**
> "Absolutely not. I love that you start right off with that. We had never really considered homeschooling."

**From follow-up email:**
> "I hope my message today didn't come across like I have all the answers! I don't, and I have spent hours upon hours stressing and crying and worrying if I'm doing this whole alternative education right. It's daunting, but it's also incredible and has been the greatest thing our family has done together."

### Theme 2: "The Aha Moment" / Breakthrough Realizations

#### Jamie Lesko - Episode 017
**Timestamp: 16:59-17:30**
> "I have a picture of all three of my kids doing their schoolwork sitting on top of this closet loft... That was probably one of the first times that I came to the realization of like, why do they have to learn at a desk?"

**Timestamp: 05:11-05:40**
> "I had a child who opted to do math at 10:30 at night. And the reason why she did that was because that was when her brain was on and the house was quiet."

#### Charlynn Chambers - Episode 015
**Timestamp: 16:24-18:34**
> "I saw so much value in the kids learning hands-on life skills as they helped with the remodel. They were learning the value of hard work, gaining confidence, and developing skills that would truly serve them in life - in many ways, more than another curriculum lesson would have at that age."

#### Keri Mae - Episode 022
**Timestamp: 06:52-07:31**
> "He writes in full sentences, 'you are all stupid, period.' And he goes to hold it up because he was so frustrated with like, why are we sitting here on Zoom talking about the letters? I already know how to read... I caught him just in time. That was the turning point for me where I was like, you know, we're not doing this."

#### Krisy Shaughnessy - In Production
**Timestamp: 02:30-03:00**
> "It was amazing for me to see how much learning could happen in everyday stuff. And so as we were fixing things, they would help me to calculate or measure... it all just came really naturally and organically, and that's part of what sold me on it was, oh, they're doing great without a workbook."

---

### Theme 3: "OpenEd Made It Possible" (Direct OpenEd Mentions)

#### Charlynn Chambers - Episode 015
**Timestamp: 35:47-36:30**
> "That's what I love about OpenEd - it's been a huge resource for me to maximize my kids' educational opportunities. It provides funding for things like museum memberships, zoo passes, and various classes."

**Timestamp: 37:00-37:45**
> "OpenEd partners with school districts so you can access funding to make the most of your kids' education. It gives me access to those educational tax dollars so I can be reimbursed for many educational expenses. Instead of trying to do everything on a tight budget, I can really maximize educational opportunities through classes, field trips, curriculum, and supplies."

#### Krisy Shaughnessy - In Production
**Timestamp: 13:24-14:00**
> "One of the reasons I love that we're part of OpenEd is we have some funding that helps us buy little kits and random things... there's a ton of really great things on Amazon for $20 or less in most different interest price points."

**Timestamp: 23:45-24:05**
> "Something else that I love about OpenEd is that the learning logs that we turn in each week are literally three to five sentences of what they learned that week. And I'm so grateful that it's not, please submit a curriculum page."

**Timestamp: 43:45-44:00**
> "OpenEd is awesome. They've been creating field trips and that is a great way to be able to find some people."

### Theme 4: Single Parent / Working Parent Success

#### Keri Mae - Episode 022
**Timestamp: 00:14-00:44**
> "What if personalized education wasn't just for stay-at-home parents?"

**Timestamp: 03:34-03:45**
> "As a single mom, there's financial constraints. And it's been phenomenal."

**Timestamp: 49:50-50:15**
> "I think it's something that a lot of parents struggle with - that like it's either public school, traditional public school, or homeschool 100%. I have to be a stay-at-home parent. And that black and white thinking really limits - there's just a whole rainbow available to us of options and opportunities."

**Timestamp: 50:28-50:35**
> "I'm still a homeschool parent even though I've got two kids in the public school system. There's space for all of us here."

---

### Theme 5: The Transformation / Results

#### Jamie Lesko - Episode 017
**Timestamp: 34:10-34:35**
> "So my son can practice the piano for two hours a day, happily. That's something he's passionate about. And he has the time to do that... for a 13-year-old, that's pretty extraordinary."

**Timestamp: 19:48-20:01**
> "I keep asking, I'm like, are you sure you don't want to do your senior year at the local school? And she's like, no, I am good. She has goals in mind. She's got the next three years of her life planned."

#### Charlynn Chambers - Episode 015
**Timestamp: 27:11-28:00**
> "One of the things I love most about this idea of open education is that I want my kids to be lifelong learners. I don't want them to feel like learning stops when school is over."

**Timestamp: 31:41-32:00**
> "My kids have been developing valuable skills like counting money back to customers. Adults often comment on how well they can do this compared to some adults they know."

#### Krisy Shaughnessy - In Production
**Timestamp: 01:24-01:38**
> "And so we've loved it more than we thought we would."

**Timestamp: 24:05-24:30**
> "They would come home and just be like, learning's boring. And because they were being classroom managed... they kind of shut down. And then when we pulled them out, curiosity came back and they were like, oh, what do I wanna learn about?"

---

### Theme 6: Family Connection / Quality Time

#### Keri Mae - Episode 022
**Timestamp: 27:13-28:01**
> "When they come home from school, school's done. We've got other things that they need to learn."

**Timestamp: 28:01-28:15**
> "I have my kids help me cook dinner every night. Like it's a collaborative team event whenever we make dinner."

#### Krisy Shaughnessy - In Production
**Timestamp: 32:08-32:30**
> "Probably just the time that we get to spend with our kids. It feels almost like we're cheating the system somehow by getting to spend so many extra hours with our kids."

**Timestamp: 32:45-33:10**
> "We've thought so many times of if they were gone all day and getting home, doing homework and then sending 'em off to practice, we really wouldn't have the quality family time that we do."

**Timestamp: 33:00-33:15**
> "The relationship and the connection is the priority and everything else seems to just work out as we focused on that."

---

### Theme 7: Special Needs / Neurodivergent Kids

#### Charlynn Chambers - Episode 015
**Timestamp: 03:12-04:00**
> "Now that we're homeschooling, I can see some of their challenges and I'm so glad we made this choice. I can give them the individualized attention they need and teach them in ways that work best for them."

**Timestamp: 04:20-04:45**
> "Even in a small class of 17 kids, you can't cater to one student who's struggling as much as I can at home. I love that I get to really customize their education."

#### Keri Mae - Episode 022
**Timestamp: 01:45-02:49**
> "My middle child is autistic. And so he started off in public school and we quickly realized that there were some challenges... He started having night terrors at home and wetting the bed once he went back to school and it was always about the bell."

**Timestamp: 02:49-03:14**
> "The admin said, well, you know, maybe public school is just not right for him. Maybe you need to homeschool him instead."

**Timestamp: 04:33-05:01** (on Montessori solution)
> "All of the problems we had previously were just gone because of the way they ran their school."

---

### Theme 8: Advice for New Parents / Encouragement

#### Charlynn Chambers - Episode 015
**Timestamp: 46:09-47:00**
> "Be patient with yourself and realize that things will change. Whether it's your kid's attitude, your curriculum choices, your schedule, or your patience - it's all going to change. You have to be willing to work with it."

#### Krisy Shaughnessy - In Production
**Timestamp: 43:30-44:00**
> "My number one thing I would say is to trust yourself. You will have those doubts and just realize that those doubts are so normal."

**Timestamp: 43:45-44:15**
> "Who is more invested in your kid than you and who knows your kid better than you? The teacher might be amazing and love your kid too, but they're never gonna love your kid the way you love your kid."

#### Keri Mae - Episode 022
**Timestamp: 38:14-38:45**
> "I think the biggest why is love. Really, that's at the end of the day. I love my children. I love children in general. It's what got me into education in the first place."
