# Project DANDELION

> *"The founders and creators who will define the next generation are those who understand the invisible physics of how groups of people decide to trust something new."*

**Classification:** Internal Blueprint

## Mission

Build a replicable content system that:
1. Creates low-friction, high-volume content formats
2. Finds and activates social dandelions (the most present, not the most famous)
3. Tracks what spreads and why
4. Documents everything as a playbook for future clients

**This is the first field test for the Creative Intelligence Agency model.**

OpenEd is Client Zero. What we learn here becomes the offering.

## The Dandelion Thesis

From Lewis Kallow's research on complex contagions:

- **Simple contagions** (viral cat videos) spread with single exposure
- **Complex contagions** (trying a new product, changing behavior) require **multiple exposures from trusted sources**
- The people who spread complex ideas aren't the most famous - they're the **most socially present** (social dandelions)
- To spread a complex idea, you need **wide bridges** - tight-knit communities where people hear about it from multiple contacts

### Two Plays, Two Strategies

**SIMPLE CONTAGION (Project Dandelion focus):**
- Shareable, low-friction content formats
- Paid ads, short-form video, replicable templates
- Goal: Volume, reach, top-of-funnel awareness
- Chavilah can run these workflows independently
- No complex coordination of actors needed

**COMPLEX CONTAGION (Curriculove focus):**
- Trust-based, community-embedded strategy
- Influencers with profiles, templates, recommendations
- Content about curricula people already use and trust
- Finding and activating social dandelions in homeschool communities
- The "magic" - multiple touchpoints from trusted sources

**The connection:** Simple contagion content drives traffic → Curriculove captures and converts → Dandelion network spreads trust.

Project Dandelion = the engine. Curriculove = the conversion point where dandelion magic happens.

## Current Sprint

**Sprint 01:** Jan 27 - Feb 7, 2026
**Operator:** Elijah
**Focus:** Meta retargeting, short-form video, YouTube research

See: [SPRINT-01.md](./SPRINT-01.md)

---

## Three Priorities

All focused on **simple contagion** - shareable, scalable, Chavilah-runnable.

### 1. Paid Acquisition (Meta + YouTube Research)
- Revive retargeting campaigns with refreshed creative
- Figure out tracking and attribution
- Research YouTube ads as potential channel
- **Constraint:** Formats Chavilah can manage ongoing, no complex actor coordination

### 2. Short-Form Video Engine
- Create native-feeling content (not polished productions)
- Test multiple formats fast
- Tie to curriculum content people already trust
- **Constraint:** Templates and workflows, not one-off productions

### 3. Replicable Format Playbook
- Document everything we test
- Note what works, what doesn't, and why
- Build templates others can use
- **Goal:** Playbook that Chavilah (or future CIA clients) can run independently

## The Game

We're treating this like a game:
- **Ship fast** - Don't overthink, publish and learn
- **Measure everything** - If we can't track it, we can't improve it
- **Document learnings** - Every flop is data for the playbook
- **Have fun** - Creative work should feel like play
- **Get scientific** - Intuition first, then validate with data

---

## Operators

**Charlie Deist** - Strategy, oversight, CIA architect
**Elijah** - Execution, creative, experimentation

## Why "Dandelion"?

Dandelions are:
- **Everywhere** - The most common, most visible flower
- **Resilient** - Grow in any condition
- **Designed to spread** - Seeds travel on the wind to new territory
- **Often underestimated** - Dismissed as weeds, but incredibly effective

Our content should be like dandelion seeds:
- Native to the environment (not obviously "ads")
- Designed to be carried by social dandelions
- Resilient enough to work across platforms
- Spreading into new communities organically

*This is the blueprint. Let's see what grows.*
