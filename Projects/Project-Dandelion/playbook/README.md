## What Goes Here

As formats are tested and validated, document them here:

1. **Format templates** - Step-by-step how to create each format
2. **Performance benchmarks** - What CPA/CTR to expect
3. **Examples** - Screenshots/links to actual ads
4. **Variations** - What to test next

## Validated Formats (from Performance Analysis)

### Tier 1: Best Performers

| Format | Benchmark CPA | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Notes App screenshot | $5.33 | High volume, native feel |
| MG2 (video + text overlay) | $4.25 | Lowest CPA |
| Text-heavy static (black/white) | $5.82 | Highest volume (1,278 apps) |
| TikTok response (skeptic angle) | $5.10 | "As a dad who was skeptical..." |
| Testimonial cards | $5.85 | Real photos + specific outcomes |

### Tier 2: Avoid

| Format | CPA | Why |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Long narrative copy | $220+ | Too abstract, no concrete benefits |
| Styled text (highlights, colors) | $122 | Same copy as winner but 28x worse |
