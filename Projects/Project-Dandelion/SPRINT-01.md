## Research: YouTube Ads vs Meta Ads

### Questions to Answer

1. **Audience:** Where are homeschool parents? YouTube or Meta?
2. **Cost:** CPM/CPC comparison for education/parenting niche
3. **Format:** What ad formats work on each platform?
4. **Intent:** YouTube = search intent vs Meta = interruption. Which fits us?
5. **Retargeting:** Can we retarget website visitors on YouTube? How?
6. **Attribution:** How do we track YouTube ad → application?

### Resources to Check

- Google Ads (YouTube) documentation
- Meta Ads Manager benchmarks
- Competitor analysis: Are other ESA/homeschool orgs on YouTube?
- OpenEd historical data: Any past YouTube ad experiments?

### Output

1-2 page summary with recommendation: Test YouTube ads in Feb? If yes, what budget and format?

## Retargeting Context

### Current State
- Retargeting campaigns exist but stale
- Creative needs refresh
- Andrew Muto brainstormed concepts (ask Charlie for doc)
- 100 ad concepts drafted but not executed

### Audiences to Retarget
- Website visitors (last 30/60/90 days)
- Engaged social followers
- Email list (if compliant)
- Curriculove quiz starters who didn't finish
- Interest form submitters who didn't apply

### Creative Direction
- Lo-fi, native-feeling (not polished ads)
- Parent testimonials / day-in-the-life
- "Did you know?" educational hooks
- Curriculum-specific angles (tie to Curriculove)

---

## Short-Form Video Ideas

### Curriculove-Adjacent
- "POV: You finally found the right curriculum"
- "How we chose our homeschool math curriculum"
- Quiz result reveal reactions
- "3 curricula for [learning style]"

### General OpenEd
- Day in the life of OpenEd family
- "What people think homeschool is vs what it actually is"
- Teacher/parent tips (repurpose from newsletter)
- Trending sounds + homeschool twist

### Format Experiments
- Talking head with captions
- B-roll with voiceover
- Screen recording (Curriculove walkthrough)
- Carousel-style (multiple clips)
- Duet/stitch with homeschool creators

## Success = Learning

This sprint is about **finding what works**, not perfection.

- Ship fast
- Measure everything
- Document learnings
- Iterate

If an ad flops, that's data. If a video format doesn't hit, try another. The win is building a repeatable system, not any single piece of content.

---

## Questions for Kickoff

1. What's your current setup? (Software, hardware for video)
2. Have you run Meta ads before? YouTube ads?
3. What formats are you most excited to try?
4. Any constraints on your time this sprint?
5. How do you prefer to communicate updates?

*Let's have fun with this.*
