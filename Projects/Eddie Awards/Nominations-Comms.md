## OpenEd Daily - Nominations Launch (March 1)

**Subject:** The envelope is open. (Nominations start today.)

---

We've been thinking about recognition.

Not for us. For the parents designing learning experiences at the kitchen table. The tutors starting pods that became movements. The creators who made you feel less alone at 2am when you were Googling "am I ruining my kids."

Open education has heroes. Nobody's been celebrating them.

So we're fixing that.

**Today, nominations open for the first-ever Eddy Awards.**

Five categories. Three nominees each. Winners chosen by a panel of open education experts. And yes - real trophies. (They're silver horse heads with glasses. Ed insisted.)

**The Categories:**

- **Parent Educator of the Year** - The parent who built something remarkable for their family
- **Innovator of the Year** - The teacher, tutor, microschool founder reimagining instruction
- **Inspiring Student of the Year** - The kid whose journey shows what's possible
- **Communicator of the Year** - The creator making content that actually helps
- **Open Education Resource of the Year** - The curriculum, tool, or platform that works

**This week's schedule:**
- Monday: Parent Educator nominations open
- Tuesday: Innovator nominations open
- Wednesday: Inspiring Student nominations open
- Thursday: Communicator nominations open
- Friday: Resource of the Year nominations open

Know someone who deserves this? Tell us.

[NOMINATE SOMEONE]

Self-nominations absolutely welcome. Humility is overrated.
