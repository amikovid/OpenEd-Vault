## OpenEd Daily - Nominations Launch (March 1)

**Subject:** The envelope is open. (Nominations start today.)

---

We've been thinking about recognition.

Not for us. For the parents designing learning experiences at the kitchen table. The tutors starting pods that became movements. The creators who made you feel less alone at 2am when you were Googling "am I ruining my kids."

Open education has heroes. Nobody's been celebrating them.

So we're fixing that.

**Today, nominations open for the first-ever Eddy Awards.**

Five categories. Three nominees each. Winners chosen by a panel of open education experts. And yes - real trophies. (They're silver horse heads with glasses. Ed insisted.)

**The Categories:**

- **Parent Educator of the Year** - The parent who built something remarkable for their family
- **Innovator of the Year** - The teacher, tutor, microschool founder reimagining instruction
- **Inspiring Student of the Year** - The kid whose journey shows what's possible
- **Communicator of the Year** - The creator making content that actually helps
- **Open Education Resource of the Year** - The curriculum, tool, or platform that works

**This week's schedule:**
- Monday: Parent Educator nominations open
- Tuesday: Innovator nominations open
- Wednesday: Inspiring Student nominations open
- Thursday: Communicator nominations open
- Friday: Resource of the Year nominations open

Self-nominations absolutely welcome. Humility is overrated.

### Post 1: Launch Announcement

We're giving out awards this year.

Not for perfect test scores. Not for sitting still. Not for following the rules.

The Eddy Awards celebrate the parents, educators, creators, and innovators who are proving there's another way to learn.

Five categories. Real trophies. (Yes, they're horse heads with glasses.)

Nominations open NOW through March 7.

## Image Asset Ideas (For Nano Banana)

### Comic/Meme Concepts

**Concept 1: "Award Show Comparison"**
Split panel: Left side shows fancy Oscar ceremony. Right side shows homeschool parent at kitchen table with coffee, laptop, and chaos. Caption: "Same energy. Different venue."

**Concept 2: "The Trophy"**
Ed the horse (with glasses) as a trophy on a pedestal. Very formal, very serious. Caption: "Coming to a shelf near you."

**Concept 3: "Nominee Reaction"**
Four-panel comic: Person gets email > "You've been nominated for an Eddy" > Confused face > Shows trophy image > Big grin. Wordless or minimal text.

**Concept 4: "Categories as Characters"**
5 distinct illustrated characters representing each category:
- Parent Educator: Coffee-powered superhero
- Innovator: Mad scientist with lightbulb
- Student: Kid with cape made of books
- Communicator: Person with megaphone/microphone
- Resource: Toolbox with arms and legs

**Concept 5: "New Yorker Style"**
