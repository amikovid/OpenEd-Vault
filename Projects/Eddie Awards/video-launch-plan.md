# Horace Mann Video Launch - Task Plan

**Created:** 2026-02-03
**Project:** OpenEd Vault / Horace Mann Spoof Video
**Status:** Planning

---

## Overview

Launch Matt Bowman's Horace Mann spoof video (an SNL Nate Bargatze-style skit satirizing the Prussian education model) as a flagship content piece tied to the Eddy Awards launch. The video becomes the narrative origin story for the Eddys and the "open education" category itself.

**Core Narrative:** The old system (Prussian model, standardization, obedience) is being replaced - not through anger, but through laughter, love, creativity, and celebrating every child's uniqueness. The Eddys are the celebration of what's replacing it.

---

## Strategic Framing

**The Bridge:** The video satirizes what we're leaving behind. The Eddys celebrate what we're building. Together they tell a complete story: *shatter the old categories, create new ones.*

**Key Message:** "We're not going to beat the old system through anger and hate. We're going to beat it through laughter and love. Creativity. Embracing the uniqueness of every child."

## Timeline Integration with Eddys

| Date | Eddys Calendar | Video Launch Activity |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Feb 10-14** | Internal Pre-Launch | Finalize video edits, upload to YouTube (unlisted), prep all assets |
| **Feb 17** | Public Hype begins | **VIDEO DROP** - Publish on YouTube + native upload to X, LinkedIn, FB, IG, TikTok |
| **Feb 17** | | Dedicated newsletter: Matt's article telling the origin story |
| **Feb 17-21** | | Podcast episode: Matt + Isaac discuss the video, Prussian origins, the Eddys |
| **Feb 22-28** | Hype continues | Social clips, behind-the-scenes photos, punishment chart content |
| **March 1** | Nominations Open | Transition narrative: "Now that we've laughed at the old system, let's celebrate the new one" |

**Decision needed:** Does the video drop on Feb 17 (Eddys public launch) or slightly before as a teaser? Feb 17 feels right - it's the opening salvo.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Video Finalization (Feb 3-10)
- [ ] Get raw files from film crew (Charlie requested these for branding/text overlays)
- [ ] Add OpenEd branding/end card (opened.co/book CTA is already in script)
- [ ] Finalize video title and description (include "Nate Bargatze SNL spoof" per Matt's request)
- [ ] Create YouTube thumbnail
- [ ] Upload to YouTube as unlisted (ready to publish)
- [ ] Prepare native uploads for X, LinkedIn, FB, IG Reels, TikTok (platform-specific cuts if needed)
- [ ] Create 3-5 short clips for social teasers (best jokes, punchlines)

### Phase 2: Written Content Production (Feb 3-14)
- [ ] **The Open Education Charter** - 10 principles document (Declaration of Independence / 95 Theses energy). Accompanies the video and Eddys launch. Draft exists at `open-education-charter.md` - Charlie to edit.
- [ ] **Matt's Origin Story Article** - In Matt's voice, tells how the idea came about (the Bargatze skit, finding actors, the one-room schoolhouse, the punishment chart). Bridges to the Charter and the Eddys announcement.
- [ ] **Dedicated Newsletter** - OpenEd Daily special edition to accompany the video drop. Features the Charter + video + Eddys announcement.
- [ ] **Podcast Episode** - Matt + Isaac conversation: review the video concept, discuss Prussian education origins, walk through the Charter principles, announce the Eddys. Record week of Feb 10, edit by Feb 17.
- [ ] **Social post suite** - Full hub-and-spoke from the video (clips, quotes from skit, behind-the-scenes photos, punishment chart content)
- [ ] **Finalize judges panel** - Must be locked before March 8 (nominees week). Matt + Amy confirmed. Need 1-3 more from the 27-candidate Google Doc. Judge announcement can happen during hype week (Feb 17-28).

- [ ] Matt shares YouTube link with key contacts
- [ ] Track views across all platforms (Isaac's cross-platform tally idea)

### Phase 4: Sustained Promotion (Feb 17-28)
- [ ] Daily social posts mining the video for content
- [ ] Behind-the-scenes photo series (Matt's selfie, set photos, punishment chart, teacher rules)
- [ ] "Rules for Teachers" and "Punishments" chart as standalone content pieces
- [ ] Podcast episode release (if recorded separately from launch day)
- [ ] Bridge content connecting video themes to Eddy categories

### Phase 5: Transition to Eddys Nominations (March 1)
- [ ] "We laughed at the old system. Now let's celebrate the new one." narrative pivot
- [ ] Reference video in nomination calls ("Remember our Horace Mann spoof? The Eddys are about celebrating the opposite.")

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Launch date:** Feb 17 (aligned with Eddys public launch) or earlier? *(Matt is eager - may need to give him a private YouTube link to share with select contacts before public launch)*
2. ~~**Podcast timing:**~~ **DECIDED** - Record week of Feb 10, edit by Feb 17 launch
3. **Video edits:** Any remaining changes beyond the laugh track + branding end card?
4. **Platform-specific cuts:** Do we need different lengths for TikTok/Reels vs YouTube?
5. **Eddy Awards announcement:** Soft tease in video launch content, or full announcement?
6. **Judges panel:** Matt + Amy confirmed. When to announce remaining judges? During hype week (Feb 17-28) feels natural. Need to finalize the rest from the [27-candidate Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jNCFz_fgTPkpWEzwPdn1GI4mfsRpUnxr9VSfsU2skJk/edit) before March 8.
7. **Charter naming:** "The Open Education Charter" - or something else? Other options: "10 Principles of Open Education", "The Open Education Declaration"
