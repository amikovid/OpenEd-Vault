# The 2026 Eddy Awards - Campaign Assets

Everything needed to launch The Eddys, in one shareable document.

---

## What We Need to Do

### Visual Assets (Ella)

- \[ \] **Trophy concept sketch** - Silver horse head + black glasses. Get rough sketch for buy-in before final render.

- \[ \] **Eddy badge/logo** - Sub-brand mark. Purple primary, clean/tech-y. Needs 3 sizes (hero, social corner, icon).

- \[ \] **Social templates** - Branded frames for announcements. Create once, reuse all 5 weeks.

- \[ \] **Staff shareable graphics** - "Nominate someone" or "I'm voting" templates for Slack drops.

### Copy/Infrastructure (Charlie)

- \[ \] **Landing page** - Build in Webflow at `/eddy-awards`. Copy drafted below.

- \[ \] **Nomination form** - Google Form with category branching. Fields specified below.

- \[ \] **Internal Slack announcement** - Ready for Feb 10. Options drafted below.

- \[ \] **Judging panel** - Recruit 3-5 open education experts before March 8.

## Trophy & Badge Brief

**For Ella - design kickoff**

### Trophy Concept

- **Form:** Horse head (Ed mascot) in silver/metallic finish

- **Glasses:** Black-framed, Ed's signature

- **Base:** Could be book, apple, or educational symbol

- **Size:** Desktop-worthy, 6-8 inches

- **Vibe:** Oscar meets Ed. Prestigious but playful.

### Badge/Logo

- **Primary color:** Purple (differentiates from OpenEd orange/blue)

- **Style:** Tech-y, clean, crisp

- **Text:** "The Eddy Awards" or "The Eddys" + optional year

## Landing Page Copy

**URL:** `/eddy-awards`

### Hero

> **The 2026 Eddy Awards**\
> Celebrating Innovation in Open Education

Subhead: The first major awards honoring the parents, educators, creators, and innovators making personalized learning possible.

CTA: `Nominate Someone`

### What Are The Eddys?

The Eddy Awards celebrate the people and resources making open education work.

Not the politicians debating it. Not the pundits predicting it. The parents building learning experiences in their living rooms. The teachers starting microschools. The creators making content that actually helps families. The companies building tools that give parents real choices.

Every year, we honor standouts in five categories - chosen by a panel of open education experts from nominations submitted by families like yours.

**Why "Eddy"?** Meet Ed - our mascot with the glasses. He represents the curiosity, humor, and intelligence at the heart of open education. The Eddys are his awards. (Yes, he insisted on naming rights.)

### The Five Categories

**Parent Educator of the Year**\
Honoring the parent or guardian who has built an innovative, comprehensive learning approach for their family.\
*This isn't about having it all figured out. It's about showing what's possible when you design education around your actual kids.*

**Innovator of the Year**\
Recognizing the teacher, tutor, microschool founder, or community organizer reimagining instruction outside traditional classrooms.\
*Pods, online programs, co-ops - if you're building something that works, we want to know about it.*

**Inspiring Student of the Year**\
Celebrating a young person whose educational journey shows what personalized learning can unlock.\
*Overcoming challenges. Pursuing passions. Starting something. There are many ways to be inspiring.*

**Communicator of the Year**\
Honoring the YouTuber, podcaster, blogger, or creator making open education content that actually helps families.\
*The voices helping parents feel less alone and more equipped.*

**Open Education Resource of the Year**\
Recognizing a standout curriculum, tool, app, or platform giving families more power and flexibility.\
*The products that actually work - as voted by the people using them.*

### How It Works

**Nominate (March 1-7)** - Tell us who deserves recognition. One category per day.

**Nominees Announced (March 8-14)** - Three nominees per category from public + internal selections.

**Winners Announced (March 15-21)** - Panel of experts selects winners. Trophies shipped.

### FAQ

**Who can nominate?** Anyone. Self-nominations welcome.

**What do winners receive?** Eddy trophy, gift card, recognition across OpenEd platforms.

**How are winners chosen?** Panel of open education experts reviews nominees.

**Is this only for OpenEd families?** No - anyone innovating in alternative/personalized education.

Greetings Eddies!

We've been thinking about recognition.

Not for us. For the parents building learning experiences in their living rooms. The teachers starting microschools. The creators making content that actually helps families.

Open education has heroes. Nobody's celebrating them.

So we're fixing that.
