## Script Key Quotes (Best Lines for Social)

- "We'll sort these peasant children into cohorts by zip code and birth year."
- "The children of the wealthy will continue to access the best educational opportunities available - private tutoring, trips to museums, piano lessons, and horseback riding."
- "We'll use the meat-packing grading scale."
- "Our goal is not to create a learning environment, but to create obedient voters whom we can control."
- "Every hour a bell will ring, and children will have six minutes to race to the next class - even if they are in the middle of working on something."
- "We'll give them 15 minutes a day. We shall call it 'recess.'"
- "If parents realize they have choices, we'd have to focus on the child."
- "I have one more piece of terrible news: parents can now get started by downloading a free toolkit at opened.co/book."

## Historical Context for Podcast/Article

The skit is based on real history:
- Horace Mann visited Prussia in 1843 and championed the Prussian model for US education
- Prussian system was designed to produce obedient soldiers and workers
- Age-based cohorts, standardized curriculum, bell schedules - all Prussian innovations
- The "common school" movement was explicitly about social control
- Rich families always had alternatives (tutors, academies, grand tours)
- The skit exaggerates but the core critique is historically grounded
