## Pre-Launch Checklist

| Task | Owner | Due | Status |
|------|-------|-----|--------|
| Pull lead lists (SY25-26 + MY26 non-enrollees) | | | |
| Upload lists to Meta Custom Audiences | | | |
| Validate Meta Pixel is firing correctly | | | |
| Create campaign structure in Ads Manager | | | |
| Produce creative assets (static, video, carousels) | | | |
| Set up landing page (see question below) | | | |
| Email nurture sequences live | | | |

## Open Questions

### 1. Landing Page

All concepts use CTA "Complete Application" - is there a dedicated retargeting landing page that:
- Acknowledges they already started?
- Pre-fills any info they already entered?
- Has a "Welcome back" message?

If not, standard application page works, but a retargeting-specific page would likely convert better.

### 2. Email Nurture

Melissa's strategy doc mentions email sequences should complement the ads. Is someone writing those? Coordinated email + ads will outperform ads alone.

### 3. Video Assets

Some concepts need b-roll footage:
- POV: It's 2027
- The Specialist Was Wrong
- The Chair, Not the Child

Footage needed:
- Parent and child learning together
- Child engaged in hands-on activity
- Child confidently working on projects

Do we have this, or does it need to be sourced/shot?

### 4. UGC Creators

Two concepts would benefit from a real person on camera:
- #10 Addressing Your Hesitation (green screen commentary)
- #17 The Mom Confession (talking head)

These can be cut if no creator is available - plenty of other concepts to start with.

## Pillars 2 & 3 (March 1 Launch)

The creative doc covers **Pillar 1 only**. Pillars 2 and 3 need separate creative with different messaging:

| Pillar | Audience | Launch | Messaging |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 2 - Website Visitors | Browsed but never applied | March 1 | "Here's what you're missing" - no "finish your application" |
| 3 - Lookalikes | Cold traffic similar to enrolled families | March 1 | Awareness-building, not retargeting |

Let us know if you need creative concepts for Pillars 2 & 3 - we have a 100-concept library that can be adapted.

## Testing Recommendations

With 20 concepts available:

1. **Start with 5** (recommended set above)
2. **Test formats** - text-only vs. video vs. carousel
3. **Test primary text** - Options A, B, C, D (see creative doc)
4. **Rotate in new concepts** when winners emerge and losers get cut
5. **Watch for fatigue** - this audience is finite (11,380 people)
