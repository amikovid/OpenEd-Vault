r/homeschool

Just discovered OpenEd and I'm shocked more people don't know about this

I've been homeschooling for 3 years and spending $1000+ annually on curriculum, plus classes, plus co-ops...

A friend told me about OpenEd. It's a public school partnership that gives you:

- Full curriculum access
- Hundreds of classes
- A dedicated homeroom teacher
- Funds for materials and activities

And it's... tuition-free?

We joined last month. Already saved hundreds. Same quality, better support.

Why isn't everyone talking about this?
