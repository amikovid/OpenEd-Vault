## The Opportunity

Getting Smart is a publication with a large audience covering similar topics to OpenEd. Mason is a writer there.

## Define the Win-Win

### What We Offer Them
- [ ] Guest content from OpenEd perspective (if they're looking for specific angles)
- [ ] Cross-promotion to our audience
- [ ] Fresh voices on education topics

### What They Offer Us
- [ ] Publish their writers on our platform
- [ ] Access to their audience
- [ ] Credibility through association

## The Challenge

> "Writing content is super easy but making the whole thing worth the while is a little bit harder"

Need to define:
- What kinds of content would actually move the needle?
- What's the ask that's easy for them to say yes to?
- How do we track if it's working?

## Near-bound Pipeline Integration

This fits the pattern of:
1. Partner email swaps
2. Find contributors/reviewers
3. Ruthlessly automate execution
4. Shared assets/agreements

## Next Steps

- [ ] Research Getting Smart content to find alignment
- [ ] Draft outreach to Mason with specific proposal
- [ ] Define 3-month pilot metrics
