# Q3 Content Team Proposal

**To:** Melissa
**From:** Charlie
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Summary

I'm proposing a leaner content team structure that adds video capacity and editorial polish while reducing management overhead. Net new cost: ~$1,900/month.

---

## Current State

| Role | Person | Hours/Week | Monthly |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Content Lead | Charlie | 27-30 | $5,500 |
| Content Associate | Chavilah | 20-25 | $2,000 |
| Podcast Editor | Angel | 12 | $600 |
| **Total** | | ~60 hrs | **$8,100** |

**The problem:** I'm stretched across too many execution tasks. Angel's podcast work takes 12+ hours weekly for output that should take 5. Managing a third person adds mental bandwidth I'd rather put toward strategy.

## Proposed State

| Role | Person | Hours/Week | Monthly |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Content Lead | Charlie | 20-25 | $5,500 |
| Content Ops | Chavilah | 20-25 | $2,000 |
| Last-Mile Editor | TBD (someone like Linda Taylor) | 5 | ~$1,000 |
| Video/Ads | Elijah | 10-15 | $1,500 |
| **Total** | | ~55-70 hrs | **$10,000** |

**Net change:** +$1,900/month

## What Changes

**Angel (out)**
Podcast production moves to Chavilah. With Descript workflows and clearer templates, this should take ~5 hours/week vs Angel's 12. Saves $600/month and simplifies my management to one direct report.

**Chavilah (same hours, expanded scope)**
- Podcast production end-to-end (~5 hrs)
- Newsletter drafting from templates (~5 hrs)
- Social scheduling and nearbound outreach (~10 hrs)
- Slack automations let her run things by me quickly without meetings

**Last-Mile Editor (new, ~5 hrs)**
Someone like Linda Taylor - a senior editor who helps Chavilah get content across the finish line. Takes drafts from 90% to published: final polish on SEO articles, newsletter proofread, tightening prose. This is the quality gap I've been covering myself, and it's the bottleneck that slows everything down.

**Elijah (new, 10-15 hrs)**
Video and paid creative - our biggest capacity gap. Handles short-form video (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) and Meta ad creative refresh.

**Charlie (reduced hours, strategic focus)**
- Content engine architecture and AI tooling
- SEO strategy and keyword targeting
- Curriculove development and launch
- Training and quality oversight
- High-judgment editorial decisions

This quarter I'll likely still run over 25 hours as I build out the systems. Goal is to be at 20-25 by Q4, orchestrating rather than executing.

## The Math

| Line Item | Monthly |
|-----------|---------|
| Last-mile editor (new) | +~$1,000 |
| Elijah (new) | +$1,500 |
| Angel (eliminated) | -$600 |
| **Net new spend** | **+$1,900** |

---

## What This Unlocks

1. **Video capacity** - We currently have none. Elijah fills this gap for retargeting creative and organic social.

2. **Editorial quality** - Linda catches what AI and I miss. Fewer embarrassing typos, tighter prose.

3. **My time on growth** - Less execution, more strategy. I can focus on Curriculove conversion, SEO architecture, and the systems that scale.

4. **Simpler management** - One direct report (Chavilah) instead of two. She becomes the hub for content ops.

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| This week | Transition Angel out, brief Chavilah on podcast |
| Feb 1 | Chavilah owns first podcast end-to-end |
| Feb 1 | Elijah starts on retargeting creative |
| Feb 15 | Last-mile editor onboarded |
| Mar 1 | New structure fully operational |

## Ask

Approve ~$1,900/month net new spend to add Linda and Elijah while I transition Angel's work to Chavilah.

Happy to discuss any of this.
