# Curriculove Pre-Mortem

**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Timeframe:** 60-90 days from launch
**Exercise:** It's April 2026. Curriculove failed to gain traction. Why?

## The Social Dandelions Framework

Per Lewis Kallow's research on complex contagions:

> "When the risk of adoption is high, a single recommendation is rarely enough to move us; we need social reinforcement - to see others using it - before we decide to take the plunge."

Leaving a curriculum review is a **complex contagion** (not a simple viral share):
- Requires effort (voice recording, thinking through experience)
- Social risk (public opinion, potential disagreement)
- Identity stake ("this is what I believe about education")

**Implication:** We need **wide bridges** - multiple exposures from trusted sources - not mass marketing.

## Failure Modes (Why We Flopped)

### 1. Empty Room Problem
**What happened:** We launched to the public before having enough reviews. Parents arrived, saw sparse content, bounced. No social proof = no trust.

**The fix:** Don't go public until we have:
- [ ] 150+ reviews minimum
- [ ] 10+ curricula with 3+ reviews each
- [ ] At least 5 "Best of" category pages with real data

### 2. Wrong First Community
**What happened:** We tried to reach "all homeschool parents" instead of a narrow, interconnected community. Broad Facebook ads, generic messaging. No cascade.

**The fix:** Target the MAMILs of homeschooling:
- **Internal first:** OpenEd staff who homeschool their own kids
- **Then:** Specific Facebook group moderators (not the groups themselves - the mods)
- **Then:** Reddit r/homeschool power users
- **Then:** Instagram curriculum influencers (Meg Thomas, Jensen Bradshaw)

### 3. Approached Leaders, Not Dandelions
**What happened:** We pitched to "homeschool celebrities" with big followings. They said nice things but their audiences didn't convert. Turns out followers != trust network.

**The fix:** Find the **social dandelions** - not the most famous, but the most *present*:
- People who comment in multiple Facebook groups daily
- Reddit users with high karma in r/homeschool
- Staff members who belong to 3+ homeschool co-ops
- The mom who "knows everyone" at the curriculum fair

**Key insight from Iowa corn:** "Being a 'leader' in the community had no relationship to being a leader in adopting the new corn seed. The fastest adopters simply showed up in more places, more often."

### 4. Too Much Friction
**What happened:** Voice review felt awkward. People didn't want to hear their own voice. Email capture felt like a barrier. The quiz was too long.

**The fix:** Remove friction at every step:
- [ ] One-tap review option (star rating + 2 tags)
- [ ] Text review option alongside voice
- [ ] Email capture AFTER value delivered (post-recommendations)
- [ ] Quiz under 90 seconds

### 5. No Reward Loop
**What happened:** Early reviewers got nothing. No recognition, no status, no reason to keep contributing. The dandelions we cultivated went dormant.

**The fix:** Create visible, desirable status:
- **Founding Reviewer badge** (permanent, scarce)
- **Public leaderboard** of top contributors
- **Swag for top 10** (OpenEd branded gear)
- **Spotlight features** in newsletter ("Reviewer of the Week")
- **Profile pages** where power users can showcase their picks

### 6. Stayed in the Tool Box
**What happened:** We treated Curriculove as a "curriculum tool" only. But families make interconnected decisions - curriculum + schedule + co-op + enrichment. We were too narrow.

**The fix:** Expand scope strategically:
- Allow reviews of co-ops, tutors, enrichment programs
- "My Homeschool Setup" templates people can share
- Flexibility for different family situations (working parents, special needs, religious preferences)

### 7. Reddit Fumble
**What happened:** We posted a direct link to Curriculove in r/homeschool. Got flagged as spam. Community turned hostile.

**The fix:** The Google Doc playbook:
1. Create genuinely valuable resource (e.g., "How We Pick Curriculum - 50 Families Share")
2. Post Google Doc link in Reddit (not promotional, pure value)
3. At bottom of doc: "I also found this free tool that helped me compare options: [Curriculove link]"
4. Let Reddit discover organically
5. Engage authentically in comments (not selling)

## The Gorilla Army Strategy

### Phase 1: Internal Seeding (Weeks 1-2)

**Target:** OpenEd staff who homeschool or have strong curriculum opinions

**Tactics:**
- All-hands Slack announcement with Loom demo
- Personal DMs to known homeschool parents on staff
- **Incentive:** Top 3 reviewers get OpenEd swag pack
- **Recognition:** Shoutout in company meeting

**Goal:** 50 reviews, identify 10 social dandelions

### Phase 2: Dandelion Cultivation (Weeks 3-4)

**Target:** The most socially active internal reviewers

**Tactics:**
- Weekly 15-min "review sprint" calls
- Give them "Founding Reviewer" badge (scarce, permanent)
- Ask: "Who else do you know who would love this?"
- **Key question:** "What Facebook groups / co-ops / Reddit threads are you active in?"

**Goal:** 150 reviews, map the external communities they're embedded in

### Phase 3: Influencer Outreach (Weeks 5-6)

**Target:** Meg Thomas, Jensen Bradshaw, and 3-5 Reddit power users

**Approach (not cold pitch):**
1. Feature them: "We'd love to spotlight your curriculum philosophy"
2. Give them early access: "You're one of 10 people seeing this"
3. Make it easy: "Just tell us your top 3 picks, we'll write it up"
4. Offer profile page: "Your own page showcasing your favorites"

**Goal:** 3-5 external dandelions actively sharing

### Phase 4: Community Infiltration (Weeks 7-8)

**Target:** r/homeschool, 2-3 Facebook groups

**Tactics:**
- Google Doc playbook (see above)
- Staff members who are already active in groups share organically
- No direct Curriculove links from official accounts
- Monitor and engage authentically

**Goal:** First organic traffic spike, 50+ external users

| Organic Reddit mentions | 3+ | Week 8 |
| Email captures | 200+ | Week 8 |

## The Nearbound Angle

This IS a nearbound play:
- Reviews = warm leads (they've engaged deeply)
- Reviewers = potential advocates (they've invested identity)
- Featured influencers = partnership pipeline
- Review data = content marketing gold ("What 100 Parents Say About...")

**Every review is a relationship, not a transaction.**

---

## Tools Directory Connection

Curriculove reviews feed directly into the Tools Directory:
- Verified parent reviews > staff-written descriptions
- Social proof for vendor pages
- SEO content (unique, authentic, keyword-rich)

**This is the flywheel:** Curriculove generates reviews → Reviews populate Tools Directory → Tools Directory drives SEO traffic → SEO traffic discovers Curriculove

## Key People to Recruit

### Internal Dandelions (Find These First)
- [ ] Staff who homeschool their own kids
- [ ] Anyone who mentions "curriculum hopping"
- [ ] Parent consultants
- [ ] Staff active in multiple Facebook groups

### External Dandelions (Phase 3)
- [ ] **Meg Thomas** - Coach, active in community
- [ ] **Jensen Bradshaw** - (need to identify role/reach)
- [ ] **Reddit r/homeschool** - Find top 3 commenters (not posters)
- [ ] **Facebook group mods** - The ones who comment on everything

---

## Questions to Answer Before Launch

1. Do we have 150 reviews? (If no, don't go public)
2. Have we identified 10 internal dandelions by name?
3. Do our dandelions span at least 3 different external communities?
4. Is the friction low enough? (Can someone leave a review in <2 minutes?)
5. Do we have a reward/recognition system live?
