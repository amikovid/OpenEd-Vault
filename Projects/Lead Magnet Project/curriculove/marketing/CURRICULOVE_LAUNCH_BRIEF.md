# Curriculove: Launch Brief

> "Show me you know me, show me you care."

## The Problem

Every homeschool parent goes through it: standing in the exhibit hall at a curriculum fair, overwhelmed by 200 vendors, wondering which $400 math program is the right one.

Or worse - they buy it, use it for three months, and realize it's wrong for their kid. Back at square one.

**Current options:**
- **Facebook groups** - Helpful but chaotic. Search "best math curriculum" and get 47 different answers.
- **Blog reviews** - Often sponsored or outdated. One person's experience.
- **Amazon reviews** - Written for classrooms, not homeschooling.

What parents want: honest reviews from families like theirs, organized for easy comparison.

## Why We're Building This

We already have an Open Education Tools Directory with 216 resources (partners and curated finds). The criticism: it reads like a database. No voice. No authority. Not attached to real names or real experiences.

Curriculove fixes that.

This is social listening in product form. When a parent takes our philosophy quiz, browses curricula matched to their style, and sees reviews from families like theirs - we're showing them we know them. When they discover "FREE through OpenEd" next to the curriculum that fits - we're showing them we care.

The reviews give our Tools Directory something it lacks: social proof from real parents willing to put their name on a recommendation.

## What It Does

1. **Philosophy Quiz** - 90 seconds to identify your homeschool style (Charlotte Mason, Classical, Unschooling, etc.)
2. **Matched Recommendations** - Not "50 best math programs" but "5 that fit how you actually teach"
3. **Parent Reviews** - Voice-to-text from real families with real context
4. **OpenEd Integration** - Partner curricula marked "FREE through OpenEd" in your state

---

## Current Status

- **216 tools** in database (partner vendors + curated)
- **Domain configured:** curricula.love
- **HubSpot integration:** nearly complete
- **Quiz + swipe interface:** working
- **Voice review capture:** working

**What's missing:** Reviews. A curriculum tool without parent reviews is a restaurant without food.

## Launch Strategy

Reviews require effort and identity investment. Parents won't contribute to an empty room - they need to see others doing it first. Social proof drives participation.

### Phase 1: Internal Seeding (Weeks 1-2)

Staff who homeschool leave the first reviews.

- Slack announcement with Loom demo
- **Top 3 reviewers get swag** (need budget approval)
- Identify "social dandelions" - people active in multiple communities

**Goal:** 50 reviews. Even if this flops publicly, we walk away with quality teacher-written content.

### Phase 2: Dandelion Cultivation (Weeks 3-4)

The fastest adopters show up everywhere. The mom commenting in three Facebook groups. The Reddit regular. The co-op connector.

- "Founding Reviewer" badge (scarce, permanent)
- Learn what motivates them - recognition? Early access? Profile pages?

**Goal:** 150 reviews + map of external communities our people are already in.

### Phase 3: Organic Community Seeding (Weeks 5-8)

Reddit bans promotion. So we don't promote.

Create genuinely useful resources (needs more thought - maybe "How 50 Families Pick Curriculum" or a comparison doc). Share the resource. At the bottom: "I also found this tool helpful." Let discovery happen naturally.

**Goal:** First organic traffic, 50+ external users.

## Why This Matters for OpenEd

**Email growth:** Quiz completions feed OpenEd Daily subscribers and program applications.

**Ad targeting:** Philosophy quiz data unlocks retargeting. We can build lookalike audiences around people who prefer specific curricula. The swipe interface screenshots make great ad creative.

**Content ideas:** Funny videos comparing homeschool styles. Picture David Attenborough narrating: *"Observe the Montessori mom in her natural habitat..."* Hook: "Finding your homeschool style."

**Time investment:** If this works, I'm budgeting a few hours weekly to manage and grow it.

---

## What I Need

1. **Swag budget** for top 3 internal reviewers
2. **Green light** to announce internally
3. **Ideas** for the organic Reddit/Facebook resource (the Google Doc that leads to discovery)
