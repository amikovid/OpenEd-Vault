## 2. Learning Style & Philosophy

**When your child struggles with a concept, you prefer to:**

* **Break it down systematically:** I would create a step-by-step approach, using workbooks and structured practice to build mastery gradually.
* **Find a hands-on way to teach it:** I would look for manipulatives, experiments, or real-world applications that make the concept tangible.
* **Find stories or books related to it:** I would seek out quality literature, historical examples, or narratives that illuminate the concept.
* **Set it aside and revisit later:** I would wait until they show more interest or readiness, focusing on areas where they're currently engaged.

## Analysis

**Total inputs:** 45+ across 6 sections
**Estimated completion time:** 10-15 minutes
**Approach:** Information gathering - user self-identifies preferences

**Key differences from Curriculove:**
- They ask "what do you prefer?" - we tell them what they are
- Heavy on logistics (budget, time, schedule)
- Form-based vs conversational
- Desktop-optimized vs mobile-first

**Ideas to steal for Phase 2:**
- Visual opener (image selection)
- Subject-specific methodology questions
- Learning needs screening
- Child fascination topics
