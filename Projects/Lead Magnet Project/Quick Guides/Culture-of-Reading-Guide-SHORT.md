# How to Create Readers (Not Screen Addicts)

## The One Thing That Actually Matters

If screens are competing with books, books will lose. That's brain chemistry, not a moral failing.

The secret isn't finding the right book. It's shaping the environment so books come first.

## What Works

**Make books visible.** Not one shelf in the office - books in every room. On the couch. By beds. Where they'll grab one out of boredom.

**Read aloud every night.** Even to teenagers. This is the habit that builds readers.

**Let their hands stay busy.** Legos, coloring, Play-Doh during read-alouds. Hands busy, ears open. This works.

**Kill background TV.** It's either on for a purpose or off. Silence makes space for books.

## When a Kid Struggles

Janssen's oldest read at a 12th grade level in kindergarten. Her second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade - and slipping.

Same house. Same parents. Same books everywhere.

What changed everything: **15-20 minutes of one-on-one help daily.** A college tutor produced more progress in weeks than months of classroom instruction.

That struggling daughter was reading at an 11th grade level by fifth grade.

If your child is still struggling by third grade, don't wait. The window for "learning to read" closes, and everything after assumes they already can.

## Quick Wins

- **Hands-busy read-alouds:** Legos, coloring, puzzles while you read
- **Two copies:** Read the same book together, alternating pages
- **Let them re-read favorites:** 15 listens of the same audiobook builds deep love
- **Meet them where they are:** Minecraft novels count. Captions on YouTube count.

## Signs It's Working

- "Just one more chapter"
- Talking about characters like real people
- Choosing a book when bored (sometimes)
- Recommending books to siblings

## The Real Gift

When Janssen asked her daughter if she was embarrassed that reading was hard for her, she said:

"Why would I be embarrassed? It was hard. I worked really hard. Now I'm awesome at it."

That's the real win - not just reading skills, but knowing hard things can be conquered.
