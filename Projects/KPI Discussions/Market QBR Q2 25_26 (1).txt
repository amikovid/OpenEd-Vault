QBR Guardrails
Core Principles
Embody company culture & values
Prioritize customer impact
Demonstrate Extreme Ownership
Where you and we lived up to or did not live up to our values

Presentation Essentials
Time limit: 
Department Lead Section = 5-10 minutes
Team Member Sections = 3-5 minutes per team member
It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes to 1 hour to build your slides
Be creative, concise, and impactful
Showcase key metrics and their trends when possible. 
A goal should be attainable/measurable. 
Insights are more valuable than observations – what did you learn and what are you doing about it?
Align with company objectives
NOT a place to be defensive or justify your activities, but to share open and honestly whether you did well or not, and WHY, and what it means for the future.

Making Decisions with Data
Still do not have proper attribution tracking in HubSpot. New Metabase enrollment funnel work should help once HubSpot sync is fully working; will need Ops to confirm. Dynamic lists will be built in Metabase and then synced to HubSpot—there is still work to be done on this integration.Need to raise the bar on how we inspect what we expect. To hit our growth targets, we must be more strategic, data-driven, and proactive in challenging assumptions. Can't do the same things at the same pace and expect different results.

Q2 RETRO
Insight
Learning
How we begin in a state really matters
Our weakest launches are where we also have slower growth. How we make people feel in their first year with OpenEd is how willing they are to recommend us to others. 
Win
Why it matters (& any kudos)
Effective launch checklist

Enabled ambassadors
We struggled for a while to launch in our new states without hiccups. By the end of MY25, we were launching smoothly with a checklist that ensured we didn’t miss anything.
We didn’t have to be present at everything. We had other people present, singing our praises. 
Loss or Miss
Additional Notes
1- Ground game outreach
I’ve reached out to people cold with low levels of success. I will still reach out to people, but the ground game for me is really going to shift to be enable the people who already trust us or are trying us out.
