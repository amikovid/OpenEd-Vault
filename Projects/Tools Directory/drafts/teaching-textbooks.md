## TEACHER'S TAKE

**CMS Field:** `subject-content`

```html
<p><em>Reviewed by Chelsea Forsythe, OpenEd Teacher</em></p>

<p>I use Teaching Textbooks with my own kids. That's the honest starting point for this review. When I needed a math curriculum they could work through independently while I juggled everything else, Teaching Textbooks delivered.</p>

<p>The videos explain every concept. The program grades automatically. My kids can move through lessons without waiting for me to teach or check their work. For families where parent time is the limiting factor, this matters.</p>

<p>My colleague Rachael frames it well: "Teaching Textbooks is great for video lessons. However, some people feel it is a bit surface level, meaning not super rigorous." She's right. This curriculum prioritizes accessibility over depth. If you have a math-strong student who craves challenge, look elsewhere. If you have a student who needs clear explanations and the ability to work independently, this works.</p>

<p>The program includes placement pre-tests so students start at the right level. No guessing, no buying a level they've already mastered.</p>

<h3>Quick Verdict</h3>

<p>Video-based, self-paced math curriculum designed for independent learners. Every lesson includes video instruction and automatic grading. Less rigorous than some alternatives, but excellent for students who need to work independently and parents who can't teach math daily.</p>

<h3>Best For</h3>

<ul>
<li>Independent learners who can work through material on their own</li>
<li>Busy parents who need low-involvement curriculum</li>
<li>Students who benefit from video explanations they can replay</li>
<li>Families wanting automatic grading and progress tracking</li>
<li>Kids with math anxiety who need patient, repeatable instruction</li>
<li>Households where parent doesn't feel confident teaching math</li>
</ul>

<h3>May Not Fit</h3>

<ul>
<li>Advanced students who need depth and challenge</li>
<li>Families seeking rigorous, college-prep math</li>
<li>Students who need hands-on manipulatives</li>
<li>Parents who want to be actively involved in math instruction</li>
<li>Kids who struggle without human interaction during lessons</li>
</ul>

## WHAT PARENTS SAY

**CMS Field:** `teaching-format-content`

```html
<p>The homeschool community has strong opinions about Teaching Textbooks. Most families fall into two camps: those who love the independence it provides, and those who worry about rigor.</p>

<p>Parents consistently praise the self-paced format. Students can replay video explanations as many times as needed, and the automatic grading frees up parent time. For families managing multiple children or working parents, this independence is the primary selling point.</p>

<p>The rigor question comes up repeatedly. Teaching Textbooks covers standard math concepts adequately, but families aiming for competitive STEM paths often supplement with additional problem-solving resources. This trade-off between accessibility and depth is the central tension in most reviews.</p>

<p>What parents consistently agree on: the video instruction is clear, the interface is intuitive, and kids can genuinely work through lessons without constant parent supervision. For many families, that's exactly what they need.</p>

## HOW IT WORKS

**CMS Field:** `pricing-content`

```html
<h3>What It Covers</h3>

<p>Complete math curriculum from 3rd grade through Pre-Calculus. Earlier grades (Math 3, Math 4) build foundational skills. Middle grades cover pre-algebra and algebra fundamentals. High school levels include Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and Pre-Calculus.</p>

<p>Each level is self-contained. Students can start wherever placement testing indicates, not necessarily at their grade level.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<p><strong>Online subscription:</strong> All instruction happens through the Teaching Textbooks app or website. No physical textbooks required (though optional print books are available).</p>

<p><strong>Video lessons:</strong> Every problem has an accompanying video explanation. Students watch the lesson, then work through practice problems with immediate feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic grading:</strong> The program scores work instantly and tracks progress. Parents receive reports without manual grading.</p>

<h3>Lesson Flow</h3>

<p>Students log in, watch the video lesson for that day's concept, complete practice problems, and receive immediate feedback. If they get a problem wrong, they can watch a step-by-step solution video. Built-in review keeps earlier concepts fresh.</p>

<p>Most students complete one lesson per day, taking 30-45 minutes depending on the level and student pace.</p>

<h3>Parent Involvement</h3>

<p>Minimal. This curriculum is designed for independent use. Parents check progress reports and step in when students get stuck, but daily instruction and grading are handled by the program.</p>

<p>The placement test helps ensure students start at the right level. Parents may need to provide initial guidance on how to use the system, but ongoing involvement is low.</p>

## PRICING

**CMS Field:** `parent-involvement`

```html
<p>Teaching Textbooks uses a subscription model with options for monthly or annual payment.</p>

<p><strong>Monthly subscription:</strong> ~$20-25/month per student per level</p>

<p><strong>Annual subscription:</strong> ~$45-70/year per student per level (significant savings over monthly)</p>

<p><strong>Family discount:</strong> Reduced rates for additional students in the same household</p>

<p><strong>Optional print workbooks:</strong> Available for families who want physical backup, but not required</p>

<h3>Cost-Saving Tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>Annual subscription saves 50%+ over monthly payments</li>
<li>Watch for back-to-school sales (typically August-September)</li>
<li>Family discounts apply automatically for multiple students</li>
<li>Use the free placement test before purchasing to avoid buying the wrong level</li>
<li>One subscription can be paused and resumed if needed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Compared to alternatives:</strong> Teaching Textbooks costs more than free options like Khan Academy, but less than curricula requiring separate video instruction (like Saxon + Nicole the Math Lady). The automatic grading and independence factor often justify the cost for busy families.</p>

## FAQs & ALTERNATIVES

**CMS Field:** `parent-feedback-content`

```html
<h3>FAQs & Alternatives</h3>

<p><strong>Is Teaching Textbooks worth it?</strong><br>
For families prioritizing independence and low parent involvement, yes. If your child can work through video lessons on their own and you need automatic grading, Teaching Textbooks delivers. If you're prioritizing mathematical rigor or hands-on learning, consider alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>What ages/grades?</strong><br>
3rd grade through Pre-Calculus. The program uses placement testing rather than strict grade levels, so students start where their skills are.</p>

<p><strong>Is Teaching Textbooks rigorous enough?</strong><br>
This is the most common question. Teaching Textbooks covers standard math concepts and prepares students for typical coursework. For competitive STEM paths or students who need depth, families often supplement with additional resources. For most students, the rigor is adequate.</p>

<p><strong>Can my child work completely independently?</strong><br>
Yes, that's the design. Video instruction, automatic grading, and built-in solutions allow students to work through lessons without parent involvement. Most families check progress weekly rather than daily.</p>

<p><strong>How does it compare to Math-U-See?</strong><br>
Different approaches. Teaching Textbooks is video-based and designed for independence. Math-U-See uses physical manipulatives and requires more parent involvement. Teaching Textbooks works better for independent learners; Math-U-See works better for kinesthetic learners who need hands-on instruction.</p>

<h3>Alternatives to Consider</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="/tools/math-u-see"><strong>Math-U-See</strong></a> — Hands-on manipulatives, mastery-based. More parent involvement, better for kinesthetic learners.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/saxon-math"><strong>Saxon Math</strong></a> — More rigorous spiral approach. Pair with Nicole the Math Lady for video instruction.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/khan-academy"><strong>Khan Academy</strong></a> — Free, video-based, self-paced. Less structured than Teaching Textbooks but no cost.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/beast-academy-online"><strong>Beast Academy</strong></a> — For advanced learners wanting challenge. Comic-book style, more rigorous.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/ctc-math"><strong>CTC Math</strong></a> — Similar video-based approach, adaptive learning, lower cost. Less polished interface.</li>
</ul>
