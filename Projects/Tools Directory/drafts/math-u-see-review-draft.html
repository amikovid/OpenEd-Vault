<h2>Rachael's Take</h2>

<p>When a parent comes to me saying their child "just doesn't get math," I almost always point them toward Math-U-See first. I've seen it work magic for students who struggled with abstract concepts - the manipulatives aren't just a gimmick, they're the whole method.</p>

<p>If you have a kinesthetic learner who needs to <em>touch</em> math to understand it, this is your curriculum. The colored blocks make abstract concepts concrete, and the mastery approach means kids don't move on until they truly understand.</p>

<h2>What Our Teachers Say</h2>

<p>I'm not the only OpenEd teacher who recommends Math-U-See regularly. Here's what my colleagues have observed:</p>

<blockquote>"Math U See is a fantastic hands on curriculum with manipulatives that are great for kinesthetic learners." <br>— <strong>Rachael Davie</strong>, OpenEd Teacher</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Math U See might be a great fit - Great manipulatives that are key to the method, calm video lessons with an engaging math teacher in 5 minute chunks." <br>— <strong>Keely Shaw-Kueper</strong>, OpenEd Teacher</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Math U See is great if they want a hands on curriculum. It's book based and you can purchase video lessons that go with each lesson." <br>— <strong>Kirsten Carroll</strong>, OpenEd Teacher</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It sounds like she might benefit from a more hands on manipulatives based curriculum like Math-U-See or Right Start Math. Both of these are really good for students who struggle with understanding abstract concepts, but they would require parent involvement for each lesson." <br>— <strong>Rachael Davie</strong>, OpenEd Teacher</blockquote>

<h2>Who It's Best For</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kinesthetic learners</strong> who need to physically manipulate objects to understand concepts</li>
<li><strong>Students who've struggled</strong> with other math programs or have math anxiety</li>
<li><strong>Visual learners</strong> who benefit from seeing math represented with colored blocks</li>
<li><strong>Parents who want structure</strong> but need video support for teaching</li>
<li><strong>Families with multiple children</strong> - manipulatives and instructor packs can be reused</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who It Might Not Fit</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced math students</strong> who need more challenge and problem-solving depth</li>
<li><strong>Kids who crave variety</strong> - the mastery approach means spending extended time on one concept</li>
<li><strong>Families on tight budgets</strong> - the upfront cost for manipulatives and materials adds up</li>
<li><strong>Independent learners</strong> who don't want parent involvement - younger levels require supervision</li>
</ul>

<h2>What It Covers</h2>

<p><strong>Complete K-12 mathematics program:</strong> From fundamental arithmetic through calculus. The sequence is mastery-based, meaning students don't move forward until they've truly grasped each concept.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching format:</strong> Video lessons (DVD or streaming), physical manipulatives (the famous colored blocks), student workbooks, and teacher manuals. The videos are calm and methodical - Steve Demme teaches like he's sitting at your kitchen table.</p>

<p><strong>Special offerings:</strong> Optional "Stewardship" course for personal finance with biblical principles.</p>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Instruction Pack:</strong> $70-90 per level (teacher manual + videos)</li>
<li><strong>Student Pack:</strong> ~$30 per student per level (workbook + tests)</li>
<li><strong>Main Integer Block Kit:</strong> ~$80 one-time (used Primer through Delta)</li>
<li><strong>Fraction Overlays:</strong> ~$50 for upper levels</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cost-saving tip:</strong> The manipulatives and instruction packs can be reused for multiple children. Look for used materials in homeschool resale groups.</p>

<h2>Parent Involvement</h2>

<p><strong>Moderate involvement required.</strong> You'll need to preview the video lessons, facilitate hands-on work with the manipulatives, and check completed work. The good news: the videos do the heavy lifting on instruction. As kids get older, many can watch lessons and work more independently.</p>

<h2>What Parents Say Online</h2>

<p>The broader homeschool community echoes what we see at OpenEd:</p>

<blockquote>"Math-U-See is a good fit [for my son with ADHD]. The single subject focus is very helpful for him... This approach also keeps the daily time required down, which is ideal." <br>— <a href="https://jeather.wordpress.com/reviews/math-resources/math-u-see-early-review/">Stumbling Homeschool Mom</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"I see both of my children gaining joy, skills, and confidence in math!" <br>— <a href="https://treehouseschoolhouse.com/blog/our-math-journey-honest-reviews-of-the-good-and-the-beautiful-masterbooks-and-math-u-see-curriculum">Treehouse Schoolhouse</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"I switched to Math U See when my 3rd grader was counting everything and struggling... she is now solid on her facts." <br>— <a href="https://www.design-your-homeschool.com/think-hard-about-mathusee.html">Design Your Homeschool</a></blockquote>

<h2>Common Concerns</h2>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Yes, it's an investment. But the materials are reusable, and many families find the video instruction saves them from hiring a tutor.</p>

<p><strong>Pacing:</strong> Some kids find the mastery approach slow. If your child already "gets it," you can skip practice pages - the program is designed for this flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>Not enough challenge:</strong> For math-talented kids, consider supplementing with problem-solving resources like Beast Academy or Art of Problem Solving.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Consider</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="/tools/saxon-math"><strong>Saxon Math</strong></a> — Traditional, spiral approach with constant review. Pair with Nicole the Math Lady for video instruction.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/beast-academy-online"><strong>Beast Academy</strong></a> — For advanced learners who want challenge and depth, taught through comic books.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/teaching-textbooks"><strong>Teaching Textbooks</strong></a> — Video-based and self-paced, but less rigorous. Great for independent learners.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/singapore-math"><strong>Singapore Math</strong></a> — Rigorous and conceptual, but requires more parent teaching ability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Math-U-See works because it makes abstract math concrete. If your child has struggled with math, if they're a hands-on learner, or if you've tried other programs without success - this is worth trying. The upfront investment pays off when you see your child finally <em>understand</em> rather than just memorize.</p>

<p>It's not for everyone. If your child needs variety or craves challenge beyond calculation, look elsewhere. But for the right kid, Math-U-See can transform math from a daily battle into genuine confidence.</p>
