## TEACHER'S TAKE

**CMS Field:** `subject-content`

```html
<p><em>Reviewed by Danielle Randall, OpenEd Teacher</em></p>

<p>When I work with gifted families, Beast Academy comes up in almost every conversation. Not because it accelerates kids through grade levels faster - plenty of curricula do that. Because it lets them dive deep.</p>

<p>The optional extensions aren't filler. They're genuine mathematical challenges that reward curiosity. A student who finishes the core lesson can spend another hour on extension problems, exploring concepts most curricula never touch. That depth is what makes Beast Academy different.</p>

<p>My colleague Karalee captures it well: "Beast Academy is rigorous math, but is taught in a super fun comic-book style." The comic format isn't a gimmick. The characters work through problems, make mistakes, and reason their way to solutions. Students absorb mathematical thinking by watching monsters argue about fractions.</p>

<p>Kirsten notes that "the online version also has short videos before each activity." Both formats work - the workbooks for families who prefer paper, the online version for families who want video support and automatic grading. But here's the key thing she mentions: "It is not adaptive." Beast Academy doesn't adjust difficulty based on performance. It's rigorous for everyone, all the time.</p>

<p>That's a feature if your kid craves challenge. It's a problem if they're already struggling.</p>

<h3>Quick Verdict</h3>

<p>Comic-book style math curriculum designed for advanced elementary students (grades 2-5). Emphasizes deep problem-solving and mathematical reasoning over rote calculation. Challenging, engaging, and genuinely fun for the right student. Not for struggling learners - this is math enrichment, not remediation.</p>

<h3>Best For</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gifted and advanced math students who need challenge</li>
<li>Kids who finish regular math quickly and want more</li>
<li>Students who enjoy puzzles and problem-solving</li>
<li>Families wanting depth over acceleration</li>
<li>Visual learners who engage with comic-style instruction</li>
<li>Students who find traditional math curricula boring</li>
</ul>

<h3>May Not Fit</h3>

<ul>
<li>Students struggling with grade-level math concepts</li>
<li>Kids who get frustrated when problems are hard</li>
<li>Families wanting standard, grade-aligned progression</li>
<li>Students who need adaptive difficulty that adjusts to their level</li>
<li>Learners who prefer straightforward instruction over discovery</li>
</ul>
```

## WHAT PARENTS SAY

**CMS Field:** `teaching-format-content`

```html
<p>The Beast Academy community skews toward families with mathematically advanced kids. Parents report their children requesting more math time - a sentence many never expected to say.</p>

<p>The comic format works. Kids read the practice problems as part of a story, watching characters struggle through the same concepts they're learning. The monsters make mistakes. They disagree. They reason through problems together. Students absorb problem-solving approaches without realizing they're being taught.</p>

<p>The challenge level is the main discussion point. Beast Academy doesn't hold hands. Problems require genuine thought, often multiple attempts. Parents of struggling learners report frustration and tears. Parents of advanced learners report engagement they've never seen with other curricula.</p>

<p>The consensus: know your kid. If they light up when math gets hard, Beast Academy is a match. If they shut down when stuck, look elsewhere.</p>

## HOW IT WORKS

**CMS Field:** `pricing-content`

```html
<h3>What It Covers</h3>

<p>Grades 2-5 math with serious depth. Covers standard elementary math (arithmetic, fractions, geometry, etc.) but extends into problem-solving, logic, and competition-level thinking. Prepares students for programs like Math Olympiad or MATHCOUNTS.</p>

<p>Organized by level (2A, 2B, 2C, 2D through 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D). Most students take one full school year to complete all four books in a level.</p>

<p>Created by Art of Problem Solving (AoPS), Beast Academy is the elementary feeder to their middle and high school programs.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<p><strong>Workbook format:</strong> Two books per level section - a Guide Book (comic-style instruction) and a Practice Book (problems). Physical books, reusable for multiple children.</p>

<p><strong>Online format:</strong> All content plus short videos, interactive problems, and automatic grading. Subscription-based access.</p>

<p><strong>Puzzles and games:</strong> Optional logic puzzles and math games available on the Beast Academy website.</p>

<h3>Lesson Flow</h3>

<p>Students read the comic Guide Book to learn concepts, watching characters work through problems. Then they complete practice problems in the Practice Book (or online). Problems range from accessible to genuinely challenging, with starred problems for additional depth.</p>

<p>The curriculum is self-paced. Strong students might complete a level in 6 months; others take a full year. There's no timer or due date.</p>

<h3>Parent Involvement</h3>

<p>Low to moderate. The comic books teach concepts directly to students. Parents may need to help with particularly challenging problems or review solutions together.</p>

<p>The online version includes automatic grading and progress tracking, reducing parent involvement further. The workbook version requires parents to check answers using the solutions guide.</p>

<p>Unlike remedial curricula, Beast Academy doesn't require parents to teach. Students learn from the books; parents support when stuck.</p>

## PRICING

**CMS Field:** `parent-involvement`

```html
<p>Beast Academy offers both print workbooks and online subscription.</p>

<h3>Print Workbooks</h3>

<p><strong>Guide Book:</strong> ~$18 each (comic-style instruction)</p>

<p><strong>Practice Book:</strong> ~$14 each (problem sets)</p>

## FAQs & ALTERNATIVES

**CMS Field:** `parent-feedback-content`

```html
<h3>FAQs & Alternatives</h3>

<p><strong>Is Beast Academy worth it?</strong><br>
For advanced math students who need challenge, absolutely. If your child finds regular math boring and easy, Beast Academy provides the depth they're missing. If your child struggles with grade-level math, this isn't the solution.</p>

<p><strong>What ages/grades?</strong><br>
Officially grades 2-5, but placement depends on skill level, not age. A mathematically advanced 1st grader might start at level 2; a 6th grader catching up might start at level 4 or 5. Use the free placement test.</p>

<p><strong>Is Beast Academy a full curriculum?</strong><br>
Yes and no. It covers all standard elementary math concepts with serious depth. But it's designed for students who are ahead of grade level. If your child is on grade level, Beast Academy may be too challenging as a sole curriculum.</p>

<p><strong>Online or print - which is better?</strong><br>
Depends on your family. Print books work well for families limiting screen time. Online version offers videos, automatic grading, and progress tracking. Many families use both - print for learning, online for extra practice.</p>

<p><strong>What comes after Beast Academy?</strong><br>
Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) pre-algebra and beyond. Beast Academy is the elementary feeder to AoPS's middle and high school programs. Students who complete Beast Academy are well-prepared for AoPS Introduction to Algebra.</p>

<h3>Alternatives to Consider</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="/tools/math-u-see"><strong>Math-U-See</strong></a> — Hands-on and accessible. Better for struggling learners, not advanced students.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/singapore-math"><strong>Singapore Math</strong></a> — Rigorous and conceptual but less playful. Good for advanced students who prefer straightforward instruction.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/saxon-math"><strong>Saxon Math</strong></a> — Traditional spiral approach. Rigorous but not designed for enrichment.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/prodigy-math"><strong>Prodigy Math</strong></a> — Gamified and fun, but supplement only. Less rigorous than Beast Academy.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/art-of-problem-solving"><strong>Art of Problem Solving</strong></a> — The next level after Beast Academy. Middle and high school competition-level math.</li>
</ul>
