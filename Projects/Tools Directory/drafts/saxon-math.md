# Saxon Math - Full Review Draft

{NOTES: Isaac Morehouse has some pretty funny content about Saxon Math in the opening chapters of the OpenEducation book. If you search Isaac and Saxon Math, you should be able to hone in on it pretty quickly about how he used to stare out the window. That's sort of like the CEO's perspective. I think that could be a funny thing to add }

## TEACHER'S TAKE

**CMS Field:** `subject-content`

```html
<p><em>Reviewed by Rachael Davie, OpenEd Teacher & Former High School Math Teacher</em></p>

<p>I was that student who said Saxon is fun. I realize that puts me in a small minority. But I've seen what this curriculum produces: students with rock-solid foundational skills who don't crumble when math gets hard.</p>

<p>Saxon uses a spiral approach. Every lesson reviews previous concepts while introducing new ones. Nothing ever disappears from the curriculum. Students practice addition while learning multiplication, practice fractions while learning percentages. The constant review builds retention that sticks.</p>

<p>Here's what I tell families: Saxon is solid. It's also dry. My colleague Jessica puts it bluntly: "Many people like Saxon math, but I'm not sure that's considered fun." She's right. The worksheets are dense. The lessons are methodical. There's no gamification, no colorful characters, no rewards system.</p>

<p>For students who need accountability and structure, that's fine. For students who need engagement to stay motivated, Saxon can feel like a grind. That's why I often recommend pairing it with Nicole the Math Lady - her video lessons add the warmth and explanation that the textbooks lack.</p>

<h3>Quick Verdict</h3>

<p>Traditional, rigorous math curriculum using spiral review. Every concept gets revisited constantly, building deep retention. Can feel dry and repetitive, but produces strong mathematical foundations. Best paired with video instruction like Nicole the Math Lady for students who need more engagement.</p>

<h3>Best For</h3>

<ul>
<li>Students who need structure and accountability</li>
<li>Families wanting rigorous, traditional math instruction</li>
<li>Kids who benefit from constant review and repetition</li>
<li>Parents comfortable teaching from a textbook (or willing to add video support)</li>
<li>Students preparing for standardized tests or college-prep math</li>
<li>Families who've used Saxon successfully with older siblings</li>
</ul>

<h3>May Not Fit</h3>

<ul>
<li>Students who need variety and engagement to stay motivated</li>
<li>Kids who get frustrated with repetitive practice</li>
<li>Families wanting minimal parent involvement (without video supplement)</li>
<li>Visual or kinesthetic learners who need hands-on approaches</li>
<li>Students who already have strong retention and find constant review tedious</li>
</ul>

## WHAT PARENTS SAY

**CMS Field:** `teaching-format-content`

```html
<p>Saxon Math has been a homeschool staple for decades. Families who use it tend to stick with it across multiple children and grade levels. The community divides into passionate advocates and those who found it wasn't the right fit.</p>

<p>Advocates point to results. Students who complete Saxon through high school arrive at college with strong fundamentals. The constant review means concepts don't fade over summer breaks or between grade levels. Parents appreciate that the curriculum is predictable - each lesson follows the same structure, making it easy to maintain consistency.</p>

<p>Critics focus on engagement. The worksheets are text-heavy. The problems are numerous. For students who need motivation beyond "this is good for you," Saxon can become a daily battle. Many families who struggled with Saxon alone found success by adding Nicole the Math Lady's video lessons, which provide the teaching element the textbooks lack.</p>

<p>The most balanced perspective: Saxon works when it matches the student. Disciplined, steady learners thrive. Students who need novelty and visual engagement often do better with alternatives.</p>

## HOW IT WORKS

**CMS Field:** `pricing-content`

```html
<h3>What It Covers</h3>

<p>Complete K-12 math curriculum. Elementary program (K-3) uses manipulatives and meeting books. Middle grades (5/4, 6/5, 7/6, 8/7) introduce the signature spiral approach. High school courses cover Algebra 1/2, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Advanced Mathematics, and Calculus.</p>

<p>The numbering system (5/4, 6/5, etc.) indicates grade ranges: Math 5/4 is designed for advanced 4th graders or typical 5th graders.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<p><strong>Student textbook:</strong> Contains lessons and problem sets. Can be reused across students.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions manual:</strong> Complete worked solutions for all problems. Essential for parent teaching and student self-checking.</p>

<p><strong>Test booklet:</strong> Consumable tests for each section.</p>

<p><strong>Optional:</strong> Homeschool packet (includes tests and answer keys), manipulatives for elementary levels.</p>

<h3>Lesson Flow</h3>

<p>Daily lessons follow a consistent pattern: review warm-up problems, learn new concept, complete mixed practice set. The practice set includes problems from current and previous lessons - nothing disappears from review.</p>

<p>Typical daily time: 45-60 minutes depending on grade level and student pace. The curriculum is designed for daily use, 4-5 days per week.</p>

<h3>Parent Involvement</h3>

<p>Moderate to high without video supplement. Parents teach from the textbook, explain concepts, and check work using the solutions manual.</p>

<p>With Nicole the Math Lady or similar video instruction, parent involvement drops significantly. Students watch the video lesson, complete the practice set, and parents check tests.</p>

<p>The curriculum is scripted and predictable, which makes teaching easier than open-ended programs, but it does require parent engagement unless supplemented with video.</p>

## PRICING

**CMS Field:** `parent-involvement`

```html
<p>Saxon Math uses a traditional textbook model with one-time purchases per level.</p>

<p><strong>Student textbook:</strong> $60-90 per level (hardcover, reusable)</p>

<p><strong>Solutions manual:</strong> $30-50 per level (essential for teaching and checking)</p>

<p><strong>Test booklet:</strong> $20-30 per level (consumable)</p>

<p><strong>Homeschool kit:</strong> $100-150 per level (includes textbook, solutions, tests, answer key)</p>

<h3>Video Supplement Options</h3>

<p><strong>Nicole the Math Lady:</strong> $49/month or $299/year for unlimited access to all Saxon levels. Video lessons for every Saxon problem.</p>

<p><strong>Saxon Teacher DVD:</strong> $100-150 per level for official Saxon video instruction.</p>

<h3>Cost-Saving Tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>Textbooks are reusable - buy once, use for multiple children</li>
<li>Strong resale market for Saxon materials in homeschool groups</li>
<li>Older editions (2nd, 3rd) work fine and cost less used</li>
<li>Nicole the Math Lady subscription covers all levels - more economical than buying multiple Saxon Teacher DVDs</li>
<li>Some families skip the solutions manual and work problems themselves - not recommended but possible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total cost comparison:</strong> Saxon + Nicole the Math Lady runs roughly $150-200/year. Saxon alone is $100-150/year but requires more parent teaching time.</p>

## FAQs & ALTERNATIVES

**CMS Field:** `parent-feedback-content`

```html
<h3>FAQs & Alternatives</h3>

<p><strong>Is Saxon Math worth it?</strong><br>
For families wanting rigorous, traditional math with proven results, yes. Saxon has produced strong math students for 40+ years. The question is whether your student will thrive with the approach or fight against it daily.</p>

<p><strong>What ages/grades?</strong><br>
K-12, with different program structures for elementary (K-3) and upper grades (5/4 through Calculus). Use Saxon's placement tests to find the right starting level.</p>

<p><strong>Is Saxon Math boring?</strong><br>
Many students find it dry. The worksheets are text-heavy, the problems numerous, the approach methodical. Students who need engagement and variety often struggle with motivation. Pairing with video instruction helps significantly.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need Nicole the Math Lady?</strong><br>
Not required, but highly recommended if you're not confident teaching math yourself or if your student needs video instruction. Nicole covers every Saxon lesson with clear, engaging explanations.</p>

<p><strong>How does Saxon compare to Math-U-See?</strong><br>
Opposite philosophies. Saxon is spiral (constant review of all topics), Math-U-See is mastery (one topic until solid). Saxon is more rigorous but can feel relentless. Math-U-See is gentler with hands-on manipulatives. Saxon for disciplined students who retain through repetition; Math-U-See for kinesthetic learners who need to touch math.</p>

<p><strong>Which Saxon edition should I use?</strong><br>
The 3rd edition is most common for homeschoolers. Older 2nd editions work fine and are cheaper used. The 4th edition (Common Core aligned) is less popular with homeschool families but perfectly usable.</p>

<h3>Alternatives to Consider</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="/tools/math-u-see"><strong>Math-U-See</strong></a> — Mastery-based with manipulatives. Less rigorous but better for hands-on learners.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/teaching-textbooks"><strong>Teaching Textbooks</strong></a> — Video-based, self-paced, minimal parent involvement. Less rigorous than Saxon.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/singapore-math"><strong>Singapore Math</strong></a> — Rigorous and conceptual, different approach. Requires parent teaching ability.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/beast-academy-online"><strong>Beast Academy</strong></a> — For advanced learners who need challenge. Comic-book style, problem-solving focus.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/nicole-the-math-lady"><strong>Nicole the Math Lady</strong></a> — Video instruction for Saxon. Not a replacement but an essential supplement for many families.</li>
</ul>
