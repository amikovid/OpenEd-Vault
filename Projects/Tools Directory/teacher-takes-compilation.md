## Priority Tier 2: High Volume + In Marketplace

### Prodigy Math
**Search Volume:** 201K/mo | **Competition:** 0.01 | **In Marketplace:** Yes

| Teacher | Quote | Date |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Laura Hollenbeck** | "Prodigy is free and kids usually love it. Technically it starts at 1st grade standards I believe, so it may or may not be too much of a challenge." | Dec 18, 2025 |
| **Jessica Harter** | "I would say most kids love Prodigy, but that's more of a supplement to math rather than a whole curriculum." | Jan 11, 2026 |
| **Chasity Soloman** | "Prodigy Math always a fun one, cool math games, Math Playground, SplashLearn has a free option as well." | Jan 14, 2026 |
| **Daphne Gaff** | "I would also encourage math games like prodigy where he can practice other skills and have fun." | Jan 22, 2026 |
| **Karalee Sartin** | "He might enjoy Prodigy English for some extra practice that is in an immersive game world." | Jul 11, 2025 |
| **Rachael Davie** | "I still think that Prodigy and other game style programs are great resources for reinforcement." | Sep 21, 2024 |

### Beast Academy
**Search Volume:** 49.5K/mo | **Competition:** 0.25 | **In Marketplace:** Yes

| Teacher | Quote | Date |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Karalee Sartin** | "Beast Academy is rigorous math, but is taught in a super fun comic-book style." | Jan 12, 2026 |
| **Danielle Randall** | "I will forever and always recommend Beast Academy for kids that need a challenge. It's super engaging too with a comic book style learning option along with the videos." | Jan 21, 2026 |
| **Shonna Miller** | "We were using The Good and the Beautiful for everything, but switched to Beast Academy for math at semester and have been loving it. We've recommended it to several homeschool friends, and they're loving it too." | Jan 21, 2026 |
| **Danielle Randall** | "Beast Academy is such a great curriculum for this. There are optional extensions for kids to explore, but they are optional. They let gifted kids dive deeeep and not just accelerate." | Jan 14, 2026 |
| **Kirsten Carroll** | "Beast Academy has been a popular pick with my students. They have an online version and a workbook version. They use comic books to help explain the concepts. The online version also has short videos before each activity. It is not adaptive." | Sep 22, 2025 |
| **Juliann Akers** | "If his student was advanced in Math then Beast Academy is worth looking into. It is taught by monsters in comic book form. It makes the student think about math in new ways. They cannot move on until the concepts are mastered." | Sep 20, 2024 |
| **Leanne Smith** | "Beast Academy in Marketplace might be a good option for math. It's known for its challenge and rigor." | Jan 27, 2026 |
| **Jessica Harter** | "Other recommendations: Math-U-See, Beast Academy" | Jan 11, 2026 |

| **Jennifer Johnson** | "I would probably suggest something like Lexia, Reading Eggs, or Waterford from the marketplace." | Jan 22, 2026 |
| **Stacy Coplin** | "I'll suggest Reading Eggs... if she's behind then that would be a great suggestion. And they do have a phonics program that goes a bit older." | Jan 16, 2026 |
| **Chelsea Forsythe** | "Reading Eggs and Math Seeds have some great workbooks for younger kids." | Dec 8, 2025 |

## Priority Tier 3: Already Drafted Teacher's Takes

### Math-U-See
**Search Volume:** 14.8K/mo | **Competition:** 0.68 | **In Marketplace:** ?

| Teacher | Quote | Date |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Rachael Davie** | "Math U See - for a fabulous hands on curriculum with manipulatives that are great for kinesthetic learners." | Dec 20, 2024 |
| **Rachael Davie** | "It sounds like she might benefit from a more hands on manipulatives based curriculum like Math-U-See or Right Start Math. Both of these are really good for students who struggle with understanding abstract concepts, but they would require parent involvement for each lesson." | Jul 18, 2025 |
| **Keely Shaw-Kueper** | "Math U See might be a great fit! Great manipulatives that are key to the method, calm video lessons with an engaging math teacher in 5 minute chunks, and their levels are subject-focused up through pre-algebra with review from prior work built in. It is a great program for catching up, and has TONS of practice material." | Jul 15, 2025 |
| **Keely Shaw-Kueper** | "There are also a couple specific levels they have to address gaps in learning. Their AIM (Accelerated Individual Mastery) levels - one for addition and subtraction, the other for multiplication and division. If she moved through with gaps in those fundamentals, I highly recommend them." | Jul 15, 2025 |
| **Rachael Davie** | "In addition to manipulatives, the curriculum Math U See is fantastic for helping students understand concepts using a more kinesthetic approach." | Jan 28, 2025 |
| **Kirsten Carroll** | "Math U See is great if they want a hands on curriculum. It's book based and you can purchase video lessons that go with each lesson." | Sep 22, 2025 |

### Saxon Math
**Search Volume:** 12.1K/mo | **Competition:** 0.89 | **In Marketplace:** ?

| Teacher | Quote | Date |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Rachael Davie** | "I am a big fan of Saxon because it is such a solid math curriculum but to some students, it is dry so pairing with Nicole the Math Lady helps some students." | Dec 20, 2024 |
| **Rachael Davie** | "I am a big fan of Saxon and I think it is a really solid curriculum, but I was also that crazy student who said 'Saxon is so fun' and did not enjoy having to watch instructional videos as an elementary student." | Sep 21, 2024 |
| **Erica Michaelis** | "I'm also another fan of Saxon. No, I didn't think it was super fun and actually hated it in many ways, but it's a super solid program and you really get to know your math with the way they have it set up." | Sep 22, 2024 |
| **Erica Michaelis** | "I second Saxon. I did it myself as well as with my daughter. It uses a spiral method so they're constantly learning something new but practicing everything else as well. Concepts really get cemented well." | Jan 12, 2026 |
| **Jessica Harter** | "Many people like Saxon math, but I'm not sure that's considered 'fun' haha." | Jan 11, 2026 |

### Teaching Textbooks
**Search Volume:** 22.2K/mo | **Competition:** 0.10 | **In Marketplace:** ?

| Teacher | Quote | Date |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Rachael Davie** | "Teaching Textbooks is great for video lessons. However, some people feel it is a bit surface level, meaning not super rigorous." | Jul 18, 2025 |
| **Rachael Davie** | "Teaching Textbooks is a great option for video-taught and self-paced learning." | Dec 20, 2024 |
| **Rachael Davie** | "If they want a student directed, low parent involvement type of curriculum that comes with teaching videos, I would recommend: Teaching Textbooks, Saxon with Nicole the Math Lady." | Sep 21, 2024 |
