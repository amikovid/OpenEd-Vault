# Teacher's Take - Writing Guidelines

**Purpose:** Establish credibility and humanity while delivering practical value. This is where readers decide if they trust OpenEd's perspective.

---

## The New Structure (Post-Fred Feedback)

With Quick Verdict moving above Teacher's Take as its own section, Teacher's Take becomes **purely the teacher's voice and story**. No quick verdict, no bullet lists of "Best For" - those live elsewhere now.

```
[Quick Verdict - ABOVE, separate section]
One paragraph summary - OpenEd's high-level take

[Teacher's Take - WITH headshot]
├── Opening hook (2-3 sentences that pull you in)
├── The teacher's story with this curriculum (2-3 paragraphs)
├── Colleague voices woven naturally
└── Honest assessment (who thrives, who struggles)
```

---

## The Opening Hook

**Goal:** First 2-3 sentences should make someone want to keep reading.

**Techniques:**

1. **Specific moment** - Drop into a concrete experience
   - "When parents tell me their child 'just doesn't get math,' Math-U-See is usually my first recommendation."
   - "I was that student who said Saxon is fun. I realize that puts me in a small minority."

2. **Counterintuitive claim** - Say something unexpected
   - "I use Teaching Textbooks with my own kids. That's the honest starting point for this review."
   - "When I work with gifted families, Beast Academy comes up in almost every conversation. Not because it accelerates kids through grade levels faster."

3. **Real tension** - Acknowledge the trade-off upfront
   - "Here's what I tell families: Saxon is solid. It's also dry."

**Avoid:**
- Generic introductions ("This curriculum is designed for...")
- Feature lists disguised as prose
- Starting with the company history

## The Teacher's Story

This is where humanity lives. The teacher should sound like a real person sharing their experience.

**Elements to include:**

1. **Personal connection** - How do they know this curriculum?
   - Used it themselves as a student
   - Use it with their own kids
   - Years of recommending it to families
   - Watched specific students transform

2. **Specific observations** - Not generic praise
   - "The manipulatives are the heart of this curriculum. Colored blocks that students physically move around to understand place value."
   - "The constant review builds retention that sticks."
   - "The comic characters work through problems, make mistakes, and reason their way to solutions."

3. **Honest limitations** - What doesn't work?
   - "It requires parent involvement, especially in the early levels. You'll be sitting with your child, guiding their hands."
   - "That's a feature if your kid craves challenge. It's a problem if they're already struggling."

## Weaving Colleague Voices

Don't stack quotes. Weave them into the narrative.

**Good:**
> My colleague Keely describes them as "key to the method" - and she's right.

> As Kirsten on our team puts it: "It's book-based and you can purchase video lessons that go with each lesson." That flexibility matters.

> My colleague Jessica puts it bluntly: "Many people like Saxon math, but I'm not sure that's considered fun."

**Bad:**
> Here's what our teachers say:
> - "Quote 1" - Teacher A
> - "Quote 2" - Teacher B
> - "Quote 3" - Teacher C

The good version sounds like colleagues talking. The bad version sounds like a testimonial section.

---

## The Honest Assessment

End with a clear statement about fit. Not a bullet list, but a narrative assessment.

**Example (Math-U-See):**
> I especially recommend Math-U-See for students struggling with abstract concepts. The physical representation makes ideas concrete in a way that paper-based curricula can't match. But I'm honest with families: it requires parent involvement, especially in the early levels.

**Example (Beast Academy):**
> That's a feature if your kid craves challenge. It's a problem if they're already struggling.

**Example (Teaching Textbooks):**
> If you have a math-strong student who craves challenge, look elsewhere. If you have a student who needs clear explanations and the ability to work independently, this works.

## Voice Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Does it sound like a real person talking?
- [ ] Is there at least one specific, concrete detail?
- [ ] Is there honest acknowledgment of limitations?
- [ ] Are colleague quotes woven naturally (not stacked)?
- [ ] Would this person actually say these words out loud?
- [ ] No AI-tells (delve, comprehensive, crucial, leverage, landscape, navigate)
- [ ] No correlative constructions ("X isn't Y - it's Z")
- [ ] No em dashes (use hyphens with spaces - like this)

---

## Length Guidelines

**Target:** 200-300 words for Teacher's Take section alone (not including Quick Verdict, Best For, etc.)

**Structure:**
- Opening hook: 2-3 sentences
- Body (teacher's story + colleague voices): 2-3 paragraphs
- Honest assessment: 1 paragraph

---

## Source Material

For each review, gather:

1. **Slack quotes** from the primary author
2. **Slack quotes** from colleagues (for weaving)
3. **Any personal history** the teacher has with the curriculum
4. **Specific student stories** (anonymized) if available

The Slack mining report has quotes organized by tool: `slack-reports/tool-mentions-2026-01-21.md`

## Examples

### Math-U-See (Rachael Davie) - Current Best

> When parents tell me their child "just doesn't get math," Math-U-See is usually my first recommendation. I've spent years matching families with curricula, and I keep coming back to this one for kinesthetic learners and students who've struggled with traditional approaches.
>
> The manipulatives are the heart of this curriculum. Colored blocks that students physically move around to understand place value, multiplication, fractions. My colleague Keely describes them as "key to the method" - and she's right. The calm video lessons from Steve Demme break concepts into five-minute chunks that don't overwhelm.
>
> As Kirsten on our team puts it: "It's book-based and you can purchase video lessons that go with each lesson." That flexibility matters. Some families use only the workbooks and manipulatives. Others lean heavily on the videos. Both approaches work.
>
> I especially recommend Math-U-See for students struggling with abstract concepts. The physical representation makes ideas concrete in a way that paper-based curricula can't match. But I'm honest with families: it requires parent involvement, especially in the early levels. You'll be sitting with your child, guiding their hands on those blocks.

**Why it works:**
- Opens with specific moment (parents saying "just doesn't get math")
- Personal investment ("I've spent years matching families")
- Specific curriculum detail (colored blocks, Steve Demme)
- Colleague voices woven naturally (Keely, Kirsten)
- Honest limitation at the end (parent involvement)
