Foreword to Virtual Schools, Actual Learning
Digital Education in America
I was thrilled to provide this foreword to the new book [Virtual Schools, Actual Learning: Digital Education in America](https://www.amazon.com/Virtual-Schools-Actual-Learning-Education-ebook/dp/B0G34VXGLC), which was edited by Julie Young (founder of the Florida Virtual School), Julie Petersen, and Kay Johnson. The Pioneer Institute published the book in November of 2025, and you can [learn more here](https://pioneerinstitute.org/book/virtual-schools-actual-learning-digital-education-in-america/).
My first formal online learning experience occurred in the months before I enrolled as a student at the Harvard Business School in the summer of 2004. As part of our on-ramp to the full program, we took simple, asynchronous digital courses on statistics and accounting. Neither one had a teacher.
One of the courses offered a compelling storyline and accompanying graphics. It featured short bursts of text that introduced concepts and pulled us into solving problems. It was fun and engaging—and I learned quite a bit.
The other was a slog. It was text heavy and dense. Without the aid of a teacher and peers to help me stay on task, I barely made it through by the deadline.
When I began researching online learning a few years later in my work with Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, that experience stuck with me. Although Clay and I were primarily interested in the growth of online or digital learning within schools—where most students continue to enroll—it was clear to me that online learning could offer enormous benefits to students anywhere. As Julie Young and Kay Johnson write in the introduction to this volume, it could cut right to the heart of one of the central challenges of today’s schools: “Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality.” The idea was tantalizing: Setting more students “free from the constraints of time, place, and pace in their learning” could allow more to succeed.
At the same time, I also knew firsthand that just because something was online didn’t mean it would be an inherently positive or negative learning experience. The pedagogy and design mattered enormously. And for most students, having a teacher and peers engaged with them would be important.
