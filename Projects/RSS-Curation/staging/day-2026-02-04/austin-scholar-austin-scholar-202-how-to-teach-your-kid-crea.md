Austin Scholar #202: How to teach your kid creative writing
(even if they don't like it)
Hey, y’all!
This week from Austin Scholar...
How to teach your kid creative writing (even if they don’t like it)
Scholar’s Sources: What I’ve been thinking about…
Last week, I spoke at an Alpha High info session in San Francisco and had so much fun meeting and talking to everyone there. I always love answering questions about Alpha, my experience, and AI in education in general. If you weren’t able to make it to the info session or didn’t get to ask a question you had wanted to, feel free to DM me on Substack or respond to this email!
How to teach your kid creative writing (even if they don’t like it)
At the Alpha info session in San Francisco, I got asked over and over about how Alpha teaches students things like creative writing – something that intuitively doesn’t seem easy to learn from AI.
Here’s what I told those parents, and here’s what I’m going to tell you: Alpha’s approach to creative writing (or any other form of creativity) isn’t about replacing human creativity with AI. It’s about building the fundamental skills that make creativity possible in the first place, and then giving kids endless opportunities to practice those skills in ways that actually matter to them.
Let me break down how this works, and then I’ll give you some exercises you can use at home to turn your kid into a dramatically better communicator (whether they think they like creative writing or not).
Kids at Alpha start with Alpha Write, a program targeted toward middle schoolers that teaches the mechanics of writing – sentence structure, paragraph construction, how to organize thoughts clearly. I’ve written about this [before](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-177-the-alpha-app), but the key is that it teaches writing through a progression of sentences to paragraphs to essays.
Once kids have those basics down, they start applying their skills. They write posts on Twitter, craft scripts for TikTok videos they want to make, develop marketing plans for their businesses, and build their [BrainLift](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-147-three-steps-to) with organized notes and reflections. They learn how to write AP essays and research papers. Some students go on to write actual published scholarly articles.
There are also non-writing workshops at Alpha which require storytelling. Kids learn how to build characters, construct narratives, and pitch ideas. Those creative writing muscles get exercised whether kids realize it or not.
But for me? I loved creative writing so much, all that wasn’t enough.
I spent so much of my free time at Alpha writing short stories, poems, and plays. Sometimes by myself, sometimes with friends. Creative writing was this perfect outlet for everything I was feeling – excitement, frustration, curiosity, anger at broken systems. It was also how I connected with people, how we created something together that didn’t exist before.
Right now, I’m taking a poetry class at Stanford. Last Tuesday evening, I wrote an ode to my scuba diving gear. Silly? Absolutely. But I practiced assonance, consonance, alliteration, cacophony, euphony, metaphor, simile – all these devices that make language actually work.
And here’s the thing: this makes me better at everything I write. When I want to express something positive and optimistic about learning, I can make it sound harmonious and inviting. When I’m criticizing the traditional school system, I can make my language feel discordant and harsh. The reader feels what I want them to feel because I know how to manipulate sound and rhythm and imagery.
Being able to form metaphors, use personification, play with perspective – these aren’t just “creative writing skills.” They’re communication superpowers. They make you more persuasive, more interesting, more memorable. They help you connect abstract ideas to concrete experiences. They let you paint pictures in other people’s minds.
There’s actually learning science backing this up. When you practice creative writing, you’re building cognitive flexibility – your brain literally gets better at making unexpected connections between different concepts. It’s the same skill that helps you solve problems creatively, understand multiple perspectives simultaneously, and adapt to new situations quickly. Every time your kid has to think “how would a coffee mug feel about being microwaved” or “what if gravity worked backwards,” they’re strengthening the neural pathways that let them approach any challenge from multiple angles. That’s not just useful for writing – it’s useful for literally everything.
Creative writing makes you a better speaker, a better communicator, a more interesting person, and frankly, more impressive overall.
So here are seven exercises you can incorporate into your kid’s daily life to build these skills without making it feel like another school assignment:
1. Storytelling Battles
Here’s how this works: you and your kid take turns telling stories with increasingly absurd constraints. Round one might be “tell a story about a dragon who’s afraid of fire.” Whoever tells the better story (you vote for each other, honor system) gets to make the next constraint even harder for the other person.
By round three, you might be trying to tell a story about a time-traveling dentist who can only communicate through interpretive dance, set entirely in a Costco. The constraints get ridiculous, which makes it hilarious, which makes your kid forget they’re practicing narrative structure, character development, and thinking on their feet.
The prize: winner gets to pick what’s for dinner that night, or gets to veto one chore, or wins $5, or whatever motivates your specific kid. The key is making it competitive enough that they actually try, but fun enough that losing doesn’t feel terrible.
This builds cognitive flexibility because your kid has to constantly adapt their storytelling to weird new constraints.
2. Creative Insults Only
Have a day where the house rule is: you can complain, criticize, or insult anything or anyone, but only using metaphors or similes. Regular complaints are banned.
“I’m not doing my math homework” becomes “That math homework is a black hole sucking away my will to live.” “You’re being annoying” becomes “You’re like a mosquito at 3am – persistent, irritating, and impossible to ignore.” “This dinner tastes bad” becomes “This casserole tastes like regret and poor life choices.”
Your kid will get really good at figurative language really fast because they’re motivated by the immediate satisfaction of being allowed to insult their parents or siblings. Plus, it makes regular family annoyances way more entertaining.
