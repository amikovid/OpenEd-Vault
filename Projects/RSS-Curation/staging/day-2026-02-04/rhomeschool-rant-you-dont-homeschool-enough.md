# Rant - You don’t homeschool enough

I know everyone has their own ideas of homeschooling and I support that freedom but I’m going to need some of y'all to pull more weight. I have so many kids in my coop and homeschool circle that do maybe 30 minutes a day or sometimes don’t do any school - and I just have to say it makes life harder for the families who DO because our kids compare their workload to kids who barely do any work and it’s constant groaning about why they have to work so hard when their friends haven’t done school in weeks. Half the reason the state wants to audit us is because so many homeschool families are on an extended learning vacation. No one - and I do mean no one- can do school properly in a couple short 30 minute sprints each week if you want your kids to actually grow up and be successful. Please stop ruining it for the rest of us!

**(261 pts)** I agree that a lot of homeschool parents need a reality check. But making my kids feel like they do a normal amount of work isn’t the reason. My kids have different rules from their friends and they have to get used to it. Their friends are allowed to go on YouTube, they aren’t. Their friends are allowed to stay up until 11, they aren’t. Their friends are allowed to leave dishes on the table, they aren’t. 

**(182 pts)** There are SO many correct ways to homeschool... but you have to do it. You have to do SOMETHING. 

Parents who homeschool need to take responsibility for their child's education. I don't really care what those details look like, but you need to take on that responsibility and take it seriously.

**(31 pts)** I agree. I know a family who just says their kids are slow and they'll learn eventually but they don't teach them anything! Grandma finally stepped in when the oldest 3 (ages 10+) hadn't been taught to even read and started teaching them daily. Well at least as daily as mom allows.  But they don't know anything.  They can't cook. They can't be left alone.  They can't keep themselves safe in public.  They don't know where babies come from (at 16). One of them once asked me why their parents think they can't know anything how do you even answer that?
And I know another family whose daughter has been teaching dance classes since 12. That's great my daughter is highly involved in dance as well. But they don't do school on dance days which are Monday to Thursday and Friday is their relaxed day to hang around and recover from the week so when do they do school? With high schoolers! 
I wish some people would just send their kids back to public school. They give homeschoolers who bust their butts to educate their kids a bad name. I'm not talking unschooling done correctly or parents of young homeschoolers but high school should have knowledge and learning.

**(76 pts)** And this is why I don’t mess with co-ops. I’d be liable to give someone a stroke discussing our workflow. Though to be fair, I do vary the intensity so sometimes we’ve just pulled back temporarily for a breather while maintaining some level of routine. Full do-nothing breaks are troublesome.

**(116 pts)** While I can agree with some parents being extremely lax. Other children’s education has no bearing on mine and it shouldn’t impact yours either. It’s completely reasonable for kids old enough to complain about their friends doing less school than them to be taught that different households have different expectations. It’s a good concept that applies to many factors like screen time, food choices, schooling, different belief systems in the home, etc.

**(108 pts)** I mostly agree, with the caveat that it depends on grade level. 

PreK can absolutely be accomplished in 10 minutes of "school" a day, plus lots of unstructured play time. 

Kindergarten can be done in 30-45ish minutes a day (we did math and phonics/reading/writing daily, and everything else once a week). 
 
First grade is an hour - 1.5 a day: so far second is 1.5-2 hours. 

It shouldn't be 8 hours a day, but I absolutely share your concern that some families probably aren't doing enough academic work.

**(95 pts)** I see so much variation in homeschooling where kids do relaxed homeschooling and their kids turn out great and the case where kids are as heavily scheduled as those are in hypercompetitive public schools. In the end, we parents bear the responsibility for what our kids learn. And that includes kids in public schools. Public schools at least provide some guidance but oftentimes don't.

**(33 pts)** I think it depends on what you consider “school”. With my k-5 we probably did 30-60 minutes of sit down school. But then we’d be at the museum or library for various events. We also listened to audio books all the time in the car and so on and so forth. Now with my 7th grader we sit and do a lot more work (like 3-4 hours worth). It definitely depends on how people are defining their schooling efforts.

**(83 pts)** LOL! If anything, I see too many posts in this sub about people homeschooling *too much!  "*My four-year-old can't recite a soliloquy from *King Lear.*  Can she still get into Harvard?"

Look, I encourage families to test their kids annually or semiannually, voluntarily if it's not required by your state. It's great feedback and helps keep the State off our backs.  Apart from that, I really don't care what people are doing.

**(16 pts)** I once had a friend who said I treat homeschooling like it's my job. He meant it as praise when speaking to another friend who was considering homeschooling their children. I never thought of it like that. I just knew that us choosing to homeschool meant it's a priority, and I should treat it as such. During the pandemic, we joined an unschooling group that met outside. I quickly learned that not everyone takes their child's education as seriously. While I know unschooling can be done well when implemented right a good number of the families in that circle were definitely neglecting their children's education. Most weren't even parenting beyond the basic food, clothes, and housing. I couldn't get behind what they thought was unschooling/homeschooling. I like that my state is lax on regulations, but I definitely see why some legislators want more restrictions.
