Im tired of buying a new $50 printer every year just for it to stop working or jam every 5 minutes.. i want a solid upgrade this time.

whats the best printer on the market right now that’s actually STURDY and wont lose connection to the wifi every time i try to use it??

prefer something under $300 but i'll pay more for something that actually LIVES up to the hype. what are you guys using?   
Thanks for sharing!

**(5 pts)** You probably want to invest in either a tank-style inkjet or an entry-level laser printer. At that price point, you could do either.

Tank inkjets are the cheapest in terms of ongoing printing costs. Epson's EcoTank line is a popular option, but there are other brands as well. Epson printers can be prone to clogging/drying out if you prefer to do large batches and print infrequently, but if you're printing on a weekly basis or more, you probably will not have an issue.

Laser printers are the best option if you like to print large batches - toner is a powder so can't dry out the way ink can, and they print 20-30 times faster than an inkjet. (The toner is magnetized onto a roller that heats up and fuses everything onto the paper as it goes through - no back and forth motion.) They are also the most likely to be repairable over a long period of time - it's not unusual to hear of them lasting a decade or more for home use. My MIL has one that is over 20 years old and still won't die. Brother has probably the best overall reputation for quality and longevity.

My current printer is a Canon imageClass laser printer and I've been very happy with it so far - I've had it for going on three years and so far it has needed one toner replacement, one hard reset by unplugging it for five minutes, and one cleaning cycle when we moved the shelf it was sitting on and a little bit of toner spilled. All very easy to DIY. It also accepts generic toner cartridges, which cuts down my printing costs by about 2/3 compared to using name brand.

**(5 pts)** Trust me on this.


Grab Brother Laser jet printer.   One toner prints 700 pages.  Get one from Costco.  


Setup any device in less than a minute(it's not really even a setup, u just connect wifi, that's it) and print remotely with any device in your home.  


$250

**(2 pts)** My Canon Imageclass lasted almost 20 years. I have an HP Laserjet Pro now and it's really good. I print in batches of a 100 pages at a time and it has never jammed on me. The one I have is just under $300 currently.

**(2 pts)** Tank inkjets or Epson's EcoTank

**(2 pts)** For home use with homeschooling, I’ve had great luck with the Brother HL-L2395DW - it’s monochrome but super reliable, prints fast, and the wireless connection is way more stable than cheaper models. Usually under $300 and lots of folks in homeschool groups recommend it too.
