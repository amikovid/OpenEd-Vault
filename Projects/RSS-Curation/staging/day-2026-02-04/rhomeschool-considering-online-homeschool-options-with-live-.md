**(2 pts)** Legacy online school has been a good fit for us too, mostly because of the teachers. they are real people teaching live, not prerecorded videos. My son struggles with focus, and having a set time with a teacher and classmates helped a lot! We still keep afternoons flexible, which was important for us

**(2 pts)** my spouse and I compared a few options last year. Pearson Online Academy had good curriculum but the live session times were limited and did not fit our time zone. we also checked out Time4Learning, which was flexible but felt too light on live interaction. we eventually ended up with Legacy School because it offered real daily live classes and a way to mix self paced work with structured time.

**(2 pts)** We had good experiences with IEW on outschool (expository writing) and Science Mom for middle school science topics.

**(2 pts)** Ignite Learning Academy has been a great fit for us. Perfect mix of live classes with teachers but flexibility to complete work at the times that work best for us. Plus, my daughter absolutely loves the cooking club and my son loves the Minecraft Club. The school is seriously amazing.
