# The Importance of Handwriting in the Age of AI

Julie Bogart argues for handwriting's critical role in child development despite widespread technological alternatives. She contends that handwriting serves as a protective practice against algorithmic influence.

## Key Arguments

### Cognitive Benefits

> "Handwriting lights up more areas of the brain than typing or voice to text. It anchors memory, focus, and creativity."

This neurological advantage supports independent thinking without technological suggestions or corrections.

### Protection of Original Thought

The central thesis: handwriting enables children to develop authentic ideas without interference from AI-powered writing suggestions, spell-check, or predictive text features.

### Practical Implementation

Bogart recommends incorporating daily handwriting practices through copywork and freewriting. She suggests a meditative approach: putting on wordless music, lighting a candle, and writing together with children to slow the pace of modern life.

### Accessibility

Even children with dysgraphia can develop handwriting skills gradually. The author recommends specialist support when excessive struggle occurs, but emphasizes that handwriting remains an essential skill.

## Conclusion

> "Handwriting is the key tool in the fight to ensure children and young adults are offering their own thinking"

A counterbalance to AI-dependent communication in contemporary education.
