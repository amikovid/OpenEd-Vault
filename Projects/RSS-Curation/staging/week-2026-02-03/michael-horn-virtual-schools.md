# Foreword to Virtual Schools, Actual Learning

Horn provides a foreword to a new book on digital education in America, edited by Julie Young (Florida Virtual School founder), Julie Petersen, and Kay Johnson, published by Pioneer Institute in November 2025.

## Core Argument

Horn draws from personal experience with online learning at Harvard Business School (2004), noting that pedagogical design matters critically. One asynchronous course succeeded through "compelling storyline and accompanying graphics" with "short bursts of text," while another failed due to dense, text-heavy formatting without instructor support.

## Key Insight

> "Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality."

Digital formats can free students from constraints of time, location, and pace - but only when well-designed and instructor-supported.

## Critical Distinction

Horn stresses that digital delivery alone doesn't guarantee positive outcomes. "The pedagogy and design mattered enormously," and most learners benefit significantly from teacher and peer engagement, even in online environments.

The piece advocates for thoughtful digital education implementation rather than assuming technology inherently improves learning outcomes.

## Snippet Extraction

**Hot Take:** "Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality" - design matters more than delivery method

**Stat/Insight:** Personal HBS experience - one online course succeeded, one failed, based purely on design quality

**Story Arc:** Harvard online learning comparison (good design vs bad design = night and day outcomes)
