## LinkedIn Post - Phone Bans

Post this to LinkedIn. Add the link as a FIRST COMMENT (not in the post itself - LinkedIn penalizes posts with links).

```
"Phone bans work."

Really??

New data: 98% of schools have cellphone policies. Most teens still use their phones anyway. (link in comments)

We keep expecting institutions to enforce boundaries that only families can truly hold.

Schools can confiscate devices. They cannot teach your child to self-regulate. They cannot model healthy technology use. They cannot have the dinner table conversations about why we put screens down.

This is where open education families have an advantage that gets overlooked. You're not relying on a single instutition to solve a parenting challenge. You're designing the whole environment.

Digital literacy matters more than digital bans. Teaching kids to use technology intentionally beats teaching them to sneak it.

Policy is not parenting. Never has been.

What do you think - do phone bans actually change behavior, or just drive it underground?
