# Inbox

Universal capture folder for items that need processing before routing to projects.

---

## What Goes Here

- **Slack action items** - extracted via Claude + Slack MCP
- **Email drafts** - before sending
- **Content ideas** - before they become Studio projects
- **Requests from people** - before they get assigned
- **Links/articles** - to review or repurpose
- **Quick notes** - anything unprocessed

---

## Processing Ritual

**Daily (5 min):**
- Scan for urgent items
- Move anything time-sensitive to today's focus

**Weekly (Friday or Monday):**
- Full Slack audit with Claude
- Create `YYYY-MM-DD-week-todo.md` for next week
- Archive or delete processed items
- Route larger items to `Studio/[project]/`

## File Patterns

| Type | Format |

| Slack extract | `slack-[date]-[topic].md` |

## Outputs

Items leave the Inbox by:
1. **Done** - delete or archive
2. **Delegated** - sent to someone, track in todo
3. **Routed** - moved to `Studio/[project]/`
4. **Scheduled** - added to calendar or Reminders
5. **Someday** - moved to backlog.md

*Keep this folder lean. If it grows past ~10 items, process it down.*
