# OpenEd notes: leverage + priorities

## Delegation / ops
- Transition **Chavilah** to owning the **daily calendar curation** (and related ops).

## Paid acquisition (focus energy here)
- Focus my energy on **ad conversion** using the **curriculove lead magnet**:
  - Concept: “**What type of homeschooler are you?**” (quiz-style lead magnet)
- Targeting ideas:
  - Create **lookalike audiences** from best converters
  - Find people who like a **specific curriculum** and customize creatives:
    - First swipe/first page shows *their favorite curriculum* (personalized visual)
    - Then swipe into the lead magnet/value prop

## SEO → state-based lead magnets
- For state pages (“**How to homeschool in {state}**”): create a **state-specific lead magnet** (email-gated resource) tailored to that state.
  - Goal: higher conversion than generic lead magnet
  - Implementation: template + state-specific deltas (laws, reporting, resources, programs)
