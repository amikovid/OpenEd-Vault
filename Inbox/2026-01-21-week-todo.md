## Draft: Email to School Choice Awareness Foundation

**To:** Andrew [last name?]
**Subject:** OpenEd + NSCAF Survey Partnership?

Hi Andrew,

Hope you're doing well. I saw the January 2025 survey data on school choice trends - the 220% microschool growth stat is incredible.

Quick question: Is NSCAF planning to run the survey again this year? If so, we'd love to explore ways to collaborate - whether that's helping amplify the findings, contributing to the research, or being an early voice when results drop.

We reach 20k+ homeschool families weekly through our newsletter and have a growing presence in the alternative education space.

Let me know if you'd be open to a quick call.

Best,
Charlie

## Draft: Reply to Melissa (Iowa Partner Assets)

*For #market-working thread*

Hey Melissa - a few clarifying questions so we can get them something useful:

1. **What's the goal?** Generic awareness ("This is OpenEd") or enrollment-focused ("Enroll your kids")?
2. **What platforms?** Facebook, Instagram, both? Different formats work better on each.
3. **Do they want templated assets** they can customize, or fully finished posts ready to share?
4. **Any specific messaging** they want to highlight? (e.g., Iowa-specific benefits, funding, flexibility)

Once I know the specs, I can generate a batch of options - social graphics, caption copy, maybe a short video if helpful.
