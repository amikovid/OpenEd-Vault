## Key Questions
1. Should Linda be 5 hrs/week (last-mile editor) or 10-15 hrs (expanded scope)?
2. What specific content types would Linda touch? (Newsletters? SEO articles? Both?)
3. Does Charlie want to stay in content leadership or pivot toward market ops/curriculove?
4. How does the newsletter data question affect this decision?
5. What does "success" look like in 8 weeks?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Budget approved: +$1,900/mo net | Melissa approved proposal - Linda ($1k) + Elijah ($1.5k) - Angel ($600) |
| Angel being phased out | Podcast work moving to Chavilah; Angel takes 12 hrs for 5 hrs of work |
| Elijah greenlit for video/ads | Melissa said "go for it" - retargeting creative + social short-form |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| (none yet) | - | - |

## Notes
- Linda's rate: $50/hr → 5 hrs/week = $1,000/month (fits budget)
- Linda has already delivered solid Thinker profile edits (Montessori, Gatto, Gray)
- Linda flagged real SEO issues (schema, site structure) - valid but out of scope for now
- Charlie meeting Linda today (2pm PT implied from emails)
- Melissa wants "structure doc" before end of January
