## Notes

**Nano folder:** Pending skill for image generation prompts - experimental workspace, leave as-is.

**Social Screenshots folder:** Nearly empty (just one dated subfolder). Consider archiving or documenting purpose.

**Skill updates still needed:**
- Link dude-with-sign-writer to meta-ads-creative (add cross-reference)

**Low-priority cleanup:**
- Add .DS_Store to .gitignore (5 files across vault)
