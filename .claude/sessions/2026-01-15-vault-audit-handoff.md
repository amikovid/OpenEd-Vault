# Vault Audit Handoff - 2026-01-15

**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Cruft Cleaned
- Deleted `quality-loop copy` and `quality-loop2` (duplicate skills)
- Deleted `OpenEd Daily.zip` (stale backup at Studio root)
- Deleted `4dc9011b086c410392982e6bbf2940ef/` (UUID folder with 14 orphan files)
- Deleted `Untitled.md` orphan in archived podcasts

### 2. Social Media Format Inventory Created
**File:** `Studio/Social Media/FORMAT_INVENTORY.md`

Combined three sources:
- Andrew Muto video formats (40+ with Tier 1-4 evaluation)
- X_Post_Batch_Review text patterns (105 posts, user feedback)
- User preferences (reject correlatives, like stats+one-liners)

Includes:
- Quick reference table by use case
- 12 format descriptions with ease/quality scores
- Text post format patterns (contrarian, questions, quotes, stats)
- Hard rules for what to reject
- Decision tree for format selection
- Daily production targets

### 3. NOW.md Updated
- Added vault audit session summary
- Updated project table with current status/priority
- Fixed folder structure diagram
- Updated skills count (39 active)
- Cleaned up stale session history

### 4. CLAUDE.md Updated
- Added "Start Here" section for progressive disclosure
- Updated social posts to reference `text-content` skill (not deprecated ones)
- Added Key References section with FORMAT_INVENTORY.md
- Fixed skills count (39 active)
- Removed outdated Short-Form Video audit reference
- Streamlined structure

---

## Left In Place (Not True Duplicates)

### " 1" Podcast Folders
These contain unique derivative content, not duplicates:
- `Corey DeAngelis 1/` - 5 files (optimized titles, assets)
- `Kade Hinkle... 1/` - 2 files (newsletter draft)
- `Michael Gibson 1/` - 3 files (clip assets, show notes)

### Meta Ads UUID Files
50+ files with Notion UUID suffixes in `Ad Creative Concepts/`. Content is valid, renaming is risky. Low priority.

---

## Key Discoveries

### Gold in Archive
`Archive/Andrew Muto/` contains highly valuable content:
- `FORMAT_EVALUATION_Matrix.md` - Already scored Tier 1-4
- `2_Video_Formats_and_Concepts.md` - 40+ replicable formats
- `1_Social_Media_Principles.md` - CTR benchmarks, hook psychology

### User Feedback Patterns (from X_Post_Batch_Review)
**REJECT:**
- Correlative constructions ("X isn't Y - it's Z")
- Soft/preachy endings
- Tired openers ("Hot take:", "Unpopular opinion:")
- Staccato patterns

**LIKE:**
- Stats + provocative one-liner
- Direct address ("To everyone who...")
- Visual concepts (cartoons, graphs)
- Alternating caps for mocking ("bUt WhAt AbOuT...")
