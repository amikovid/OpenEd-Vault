# Session Handoff - 2026-01-07

## What Was Done

### CRM Review - COMPLETE (382/382 contacts)
Finished reviewing all remaining CRM contacts (n-z range, ~100 contacts). Every contact now has:
- `type:` tag (provider, contributor, partner, vendor, internal, contact)
- `status:` (active, warm, dormant, cold, skip)
- `priority:` (high, medium, low)
- Rich notes with relationship context and next steps

### Pipeline.md Updated
`/Studio/SEO Content Production/Guest Contributors/Pipeline.md` - Updated with:
- contacts_reviewed: 382/382 (COMPLETE)
- 4 new Tier 1 contacts added
- 6 new Tier 3 strategic contacts
- High-engagement provider table updated

### Email Draft Ready
`/Studio/SEO Content Production/Guest Contributors/Drafts/mason-pashia-email-draft.md`
- Mason Pashia (Getting Smart) - marketplace data collaboration
- Last contact: Dec 16, 2025 - appropriate timing to send now
- READY TO SEND

## Open Loops

- [ ] **Sample Archived-002.mbox** (3GB) to check if duplicate of existing data
  - File: `/Studio/Email Sorting CRM project/Mail/Archived-002 (1).mbox`
  - Existing script: `/agents/gmail-crm/mbox_to_crm.py`
  - Need to peek first 100-200 emails before full processing
  
- [ ] **Send Mason Pashia email** - draft ready, waiting for user approval

- [ ] **Follow up Ryhen Miller-Hollis** - Education Reimagined blog collab already done, could do reciprocal

- [ ] **Research Surge Academy** - Robin Smith highly engaged (11 exchanges), need to identify their specialty for contributor pitch

## Key Decisions Made

- **Education Reimagined**: User confirmed blog collaboration already completed. Opportunity is reciprocal - either invite them for another guest post OR write for them.

- **CRM Classification Schema**: Used consistent taxonomy:
  - Types: provider, contributor, partner, vendor, internal, contact
  - Status: active, warm, dormant, cold, skip
  - Priority: high, medium, low

## Context for Next Session

### Immediate Priority
Sample the `Archived-002 (1).mbox` file (3GB) to determine if it's duplicate data or new contacts worth processing. Quick sampling script needed before committing to full 30-60 min parse.

### Mbox Processing Plan (Ready to Execute)
1. Sample first 100-200 emails from archive
2. Check date range and contact overlap with existing CRM
3. If new data: run `mbox_to_crm.py` with deduplication against existing 382 contacts
4. Generate report of new contacts found

### Contributor Pipeline Status
- 382 contacts fully reviewed and categorized
- ~25 Tier 1 contributors ready to pitch
- ~15 Tier 2 in progress
- ~15 Tier 3 need warming
- Mason Pashia email ready to send

## Files Modified

- `/CRM/contacts/*.md` - ~100 files updated with type, status, priority, notes
- `/Studio/SEO Content Production/Guest Contributors/Pipeline.md` - Updated counts and new discoveries
