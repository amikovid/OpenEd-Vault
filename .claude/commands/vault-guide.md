Read the skill file at `.claude/skills/vault-guide/SKILL.md` and follow its interactive onboarding protocol. Start with Phase 0 (detect who you're talking to), then guide them through the appropriate flow. If it's a candidate, walk them through all 7 phases including producing real output and writing a contract proposal. If it's Charlie, use the Charlie Quick Reference section. Be conversational, not quiz-like.
