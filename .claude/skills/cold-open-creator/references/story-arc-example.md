# Story Arc Example: The Schultz Story

This example demonstrates how to identify story beats in a transcript and where to cut for maximum cold open impact.

## Full Arc (as it might appear in transcript)

1. **Setup:** Schultz flew to SF for a dinner meeting, hoping to get a job at Starbucks. He'd spent a year flying back and forth.
2. **Optimism:** "The dinner went exceptionally well. I was convinced I had the job sown up."
3. **Disaster:** "I'm sorry Howard, I have bad news... It's too risky, too much change."
4. **Failed approach (what most do):** "Most people, when turned down for a job, just go away."
5. **Different response:** "But this was a turning point in my life. It had to happen."
6. **Makes case:** "Jerry, you're making a terrible mistake... This isn't about me, it's about you."
7. **Resolution:** "I'm sorry about the twenty-four hour impasse. We're going forward."
8. **Success:** Five years later, bought the company, grew to 40,000 stores.
9. **Reflection:** "Life is a series of near misses. But a lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all."

## Why This Works

The listener NEEDS to know what Schultz said. That's the hook.

- **Setup establishes:** He wanted this job badly (a year of flying back and forth)
- **Disaster creates tension:** He got rejected
- **Failed approach shows stakes:** Most people give up
- **Hint at different response:** But he didn't - and then we cut

The resolution (he got the job, built Starbucks into 40,000 stores) is withheld entirely. The reflection about luck is saved for the episode.
