# Ghostwriter Skill

## Purpose

This skill transforms source material - transcripts, notes, research, interviews - into authentic, human-written content that reads naturally without obvious AI tells.

**Core Philosophy:** The best ghostwriting is invisible. Readers should feel like they're reading a real person's thoughts, not a filtered or processed version of source material.

## When to Use This Skill

- Converting transcripts or interviews into polished articles or newsletters
- Refining notes into publishable content
- Converting source material into different voices or styles
- Ensuring written content reads authentically human

**Use in conjunction with:**
- Style reference files for adapting to specific voices
- The `ai-tells` skill for pattern detection and forbidden syntax

## Universal Writing Fundamentals

### 1. Energy Transfer

**The best writing is a transfer of energy from writer to reader.**

- Write conversations, not speeches
- Be personable, especially in email and newsletters
- Speak WITH your audience, not AT them
- Remove corporate jargon, academic language, and media buzzwords

### 2. Conciseness is King

**Always remove surplus words. Every word should earn its place.**

1. Write your first draft (don't hold back)
2. Read it aloud
3. Delete anything that repeats, softens, sounds formal, or takes extra words

### 3. The SUCKS Framework

**S - Specific:** Write for ONE person (your "One True Fan")
**U - Unique & Useful:** Does this change how your reader thinks, feels, or acts?
**C - Clear, Curious, Conversational:** Main idea unmissable, reads like talking to a friend
**K - Kept Simple & Structured:** Simple ideas, clear progression

**Application checklist:**
- [ ] Who is my ONE True Fan reading this?
- [ ] What will they think, feel, or do differently after?
- [ ] Could a 12-year-old understand the main point?
- [ ] Does this flow like a conversation?

### 4. Be Undeniable

Transform vague claims into concrete specifics.

- "This year, I helped 13 clients boost their website traffic by 87%-256% in just one month. Here's how:"

Replace vague language with data, examples, specifics, or personal experience.

### 5. Craft Sticky Sentences

Use these techniques to create memorable statements:

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Alliteration | "Specificity is the secret" |
| Symmetry | "Read for awareness. Write for understanding." |
| Contrast | "To be everywhere is to be nowhere." |
| Rhyme | "Tell a story or lose your glory" |
| Rhythm | "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it" |

For maximum stickiness, combine techniques. See `references/sticky-sentences-expanded.md` for deep dives.

## Leverage Human Desires

Great writing taps into 8 core human desires. Choose 1-2 per piece:

| Desire | Use When | Signal Words |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Safety of Tribe | Community content | belong, together |
| Survival & Success | Achievement content | breakthrough, unlock |
| Life Enjoyment | Lifestyle content | freedom, experience |
| Social Acceptance | Status content | elite, insider |
| Comfort & Clarity | Explanatory content | simple, easy |
| Freedom From Fear | Protective content | protect, avoid |
| Perceived Status | Authority content | research, discovered |

**Full reference:** `references/human-desires.md`

## Dash Usage

Use regular hyphens with spaces for parenthetical breaks - like this - not em dashes or en dashes.

- "Education is changing - and parents are noticing"

---

## AI Pattern Detection

**For comprehensive AI pattern detection and forbidden syntax, load the `ai-tells` skill.**

Key patterns to eliminate:
- Correlative constructions ("X aren't just Y - they're Z")
- Overuse of "just" and "actually"
- Hedge words (might, could, perhaps)
- Passive voice
- Corporate jargon
- Vague language

---

## The Ghostwriting Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Your Source Material

Read through everything completely:
- What's the core insight or story?
- What's the emotional arc?
- What would your One True Fan need to understand?

### Step 2: Apply the SUCKS Framework

Before writing, answer: Who, What's unique, Is it clear, Is it simple?

### Step 3: Choose Your Voice

| Style | Use For | Reference |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Pirate Wires | Contrarian, calling out truths | `references/pirate-wires-style.md` |
| Packy McCormick | Trends, accessible analysis | `references/packy-mccormick-style.md` |
| Justin Mikolay | Refining, limited word count | `references/justin-mikolay-style.md` |
| One Thing Better | Decisions, tradeoffs | `references/one-thing-better-style.md` |
| Default | Professional, direct | Clear and authentic |

### Step 4: Convert Source Material

1. Extract key quotes and ideas
2. Translate into chosen voice
3. Structure with clear beginning, middle, end
4. Use specific examples and concrete details
5. Create energy transfer (conversation, not lecture)

### Step 5: Apply Sticky Sentences

Identify 2-3 most important statements. Add alliteration, symmetry, contrast, or rhythm.

### Step 6: Eliminate AI Tells

**Load the `ai-tells` skill and run its checklist.** Key areas:
- Forbidden syntax patterns
- Overused words
- Hedging language
- Passive voice
- Corporate jargon

**Test:** Would this sentence appear in a ChatGPT output? If yes, rewrite it.

### Step 7: Read Aloud & Quality Check

- [ ] Does it sound like a real person talking?
- [ ] Could I email this to my One True Fan without embarrassment?
- [ ] Does energy transfer (not feel formal)?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place?
- [ ] Do important ideas have sticky phrasing?

3. **Employ pattern interrupts** - Surprise the reader
4. **Address problems directly** - Name the struggle
5. **Write with confidence** - Eliminate hedge words
6. **Highlight concrete benefits** - "Double output in 30 days"
7. **Include social proof** - Results, credentials, validation
8. **Ask powerful questions** - Make readers think
