## The Core Truth

**A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrow problem, given away free, that attracts ideal customers and reveals the next problem your core offer solves.**

It's the Costco sample model: give them a taste so good they want the whole thing.

---

## The Irresistibility Test

Before creating anything, run this filter:

1. **Would your ideal customer stop scrolling?** If not, it's too generic.
2. **Would they give their email for this?** If hesitation, sharpen the promise.
3. **Does solving this problem reveal your bigger offer?** If not, wrong problem.
4. **Can they consume it in under 10 minutes?** If not, too heavy for "comment to get."

**The golden formula:** Answers to the test, not the textbook.

## Three Types of Lead Magnets

### Type 1: Reveal the Problem (Diagnosis)
*Assessment, quiz, audit, analysis*

Works when the problem **gets worse while they wait**. Built-in urgency.

Examples:
- "What type of homeschooler are you?" quiz
- "Is your child ready to read?" assessment
- "Homeschool gap finder" - what are you accidentally missing?

### Type 2: Free Sample (Taste)
*Limited version of something bigger*

Let them experience results before buying.

Examples:
- Week 1 of a 6-week curriculum
- 3 of your 30 best resources
- First chapter of your approach

### Type 3: One Step of Many
*First domino in a sequence*

Solve one piece, reveal the rest need solving too.

Examples:
- "How to choose curriculum" (step 1 of starting homeschool)
- "The first 3 books for [grade]" (step 1 of year planning)
- "Week 1 schedule template" (step 1 of structuring your year)

## Naming: This Is 80% of the Game

**Hormozi's proof:** Removing ONE word from a title got 2.5x more clicks.

### The Specificity Formula

```
[Outcome] + [Timeframe or Proof] + [For Who]
```

**Bad:** "Free Homeschool Guide"
**Good:** "The 7-Day Plan That Got My Reluctant Reader Asking for Books"

**Bad:** "Curriculum Resources"
**Good:** "37 Free Math Resources (Sorted by Learning Style)"

**Bad:** "How to Start Homeschooling"
**Good:** "Your First 30 Days: The Checklist That Calms the Chaos"

### Power Words for Homeschool Parents

**Validation:** finally, actually works, real families, without the guilt
**Relief:** simplified, done-for-you, steal my, stop overthinking
**Specificity:** exact, word-for-word, step-by-step, the only
**Exclusivity:** insider, what nobody tells you, the truth about
**Speed:** 5-minute, quick-start, instant, today

### Test Before Building

Ask your audience: "Which would you rather have?"
- Option A vs Option B
- The one that gets "When is this coming out?" wins

---

## The Problem-Next-Problem Chain

**This is the strategic core.** Your lead magnet solves Problem A, which reveals Problem B, which your core offer solves.

| Lead Magnet Solves | Reveals Next Problem | Your Offer Solves |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| "What type of homeschooler am I?" | "Now I need curriculum that fits" | Curriculum marketplace |
| "Is my state legal for homeschool?" | "How do I actually comply?" | Compliance support |
| "What subjects should I teach?" | "How do I track and prove progress?" | Learning logs platform |
| "How do I afford this?" | "What financial support exists?" | Reimbursement program |

## For Social Media "Comment X to Get"

The format requires extra sharpness:

1. **Single deliverable** - one PDF, one checklist, one template
2. **Instant gratification** - consumable in under 5 minutes
3. **Screenshot-worthy** - they can share the actual thing
4. **Specific enough to exclude** - not for everyone, FOR THEM

### High-Converting CTA Patterns

- "Comment CHECKLIST and I'll DM you the exact one I use"
- "Comment your state and I'll send the free guide"
- "Comment your kid's age and I'll send the resource list"
- "Comment QUIZ to find out which type you are"

### What Makes Parents Stop Scrolling

**Pain points:**
- Fear of messing up their kids
- Overwhelm at curriculum choices
- "Am I doing enough?"
- Socialization worry
- Spouse/family doubt
- Legal confusion

**Desires:**
- Confidence they're on the right track
- Done-for-you solutions
- Connection with other homeschool families
- Proof it's working
- More time/less stress

---

## Quality Bar

**Hormozi's rule:** 99% of people who see your free thing won't buy. But they'll have an opinion. And their opinion affects the 1% who will.

Your free thing IS your reputation.

- **Zero fluff** - cut everything that doesn't deliver value
- **Instantly usable** - no setup required
- **Better than expected** - should feel like it could be paid

---

## Quick Generation Process

1. **Pick the narrow problem** (from pain points above)
2. **Choose the type** (diagnose / sample / first step)
3. **Choose the format** (template / checklist / quiz / list / course / video)
4. **Write 3-5 title options** using specificity formula
5. **Test with audience** before building
6. **Build minimal version** - can always expand later
