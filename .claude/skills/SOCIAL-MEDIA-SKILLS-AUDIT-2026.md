# OpenEd Social Media Skills Audit - January 2026

**Purpose:** Comprehensive audit of all social media and content creation skills, with recommendations for consolidation, updates, and better organization.

**Audit Date:** 2026-01-07

---

## Executive Summary

You have an **incredibly rich library** of content creation skills - 180+ post templates, 12 core one-liner patterns, 15+ headline formulas, 20+ contrarian frameworks, proliferation systems (SCAMPER, 8 Human Desires, Vision/Anti-Vision), and sticky sentence techniques.

**The problem:** This gold is scattered across 8+ skills with significant overlap and no clear hierarchy. Some skills are mature and battle-tested, others are stubs. The naming and organization makes it hard to know which skill to use when.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Overlap:** `social-content-creation` and `linkedin-content` duplicate 60%+ of their frameworks
2. **Hidden Gems:** The `dude-with-sign-writer` skill is pure gold for text-only ads, but buried
3. **Missing Integration:** The meta-ads-creative skill doesn't reference these existing skills
4. **Outdated:** Some platform guidelines are from 2024-2025, pre-Andromeda algorithm
5. **Underutilized:** Proliferation methods (SCAMPER, 8 Desires) are powerful but complex

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

**1. Link meta-ads-creative to existing skills**

Add to `meta-ads-creative/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
## Related Skills (USE THESE)

When creating Meta ads, leverage these existing OpenEd skills:

**For Text-Only Static Ads:**
→ Use `dude-with-sign-writer` skill - 12 one-liner patterns perfect for text-only images

**For Primary Text Hooks:**
→ Use `hook-and-headline-writing` skill - 15+ hook formulas, 4 U's test, sticky techniques

**For Ad Copy Body:**
→ Reference `social-content-creation/references/post-structures.md` - 100+ copy structures

**For Contrarian/Hot Take Ads:**
→ Use `linkedin-content/references/contrarian-frameworks.md` - 20+ contrarian patterns

**For Authentic Voice:**
→ Use `ghostwriter` skill - Anti-AI patterns, sticky sentences expanded
```

**2. Create "Quick Reference" index for post-structures.md**

The 1,143-line file needs a table of contents by use case:
- One-liners (for text-only ads)
- Story structures (for UGC scripts)
- Contrarian patterns (for hot take ads)
- List formats (for carousel ads)

**3. Update platform guidelines for 2026**

In `social-content-creation/references/platform-guidelines.md`:
- Add Andromeda algorithm changes
- Update organic-first strategy
- Add creative diversity requirements

### Short-Term Actions (This Month)

**4. Consolidate or differentiate linkedin-content vs social-content-creation**

Option A: **Merge** - Fold linkedin-content into social-content-creation as "LinkedIn-specific section"

Option B: **Differentiate** - Keep separate with clear routing:
- LinkedIn-only → `linkedin-content`
- Multi-platform → `social-content-creation`
- Meta ads → `meta-ads-creative`

**Recommendation:** Option B - keep separate but add clearer routing in each skill's "When to Use" section.

**5. Create a "One-Liner to Ad" bridge document**

New file: `meta-ads-creative/references/one-liner-to-ad.md`

Maps `dude-with-sign-writer` patterns to ad formats:
- Normalize → Text-only static
- Stop + Complaint → Text-over-video hook
- Everyday Observations → Meme format
- etc.

**6. Index the contrarian frameworks**

The 1,052-line contrarian-frameworks.md needs a quick reference table at top:
- "I Call BS" - Line X
- "State The Opposite" - Line X
- "Dark Side Of" - Line X
- etc.

### Long-Term Actions (This Quarter)

**7. Create a "Skills Router" document**

Central document that answers "Which skill do I use?"

```markdown
# OpenEd Content Skills Router

## I need to write...

**A punchy one-liner (under 15 words)**
→ `dude-with-sign-writer`

**A LinkedIn post**
→ `linkedin-content` (if LinkedIn-only)
→ `social-content-creation` (if multi-platform)

**A Meta ad**
→ `meta-ads-creative` (uses others internally)

**A newsletter**
→ `opened-daily-newsletter-writer` or `opened-weekly-newsletter-writer`

**A hook or headline**
→ `hook-and-headline-writing` (can be called by other skills)

**To multiply one post into many**
→ `social-content-creation` Phase 4 (SCAMPER, 8 Desires, Vision/Anti-Vision)
```

**8. Create "lightweight" versions of complex skills**

For `hook-and-headline-writing` and `social-content-creation`, create:
- `SKILL_QUICK.md` - 1-page version for simple tasks
- Full skill remains for comprehensive work

**9. Archive outdated content**

Review all skills for:
- Platform guidelines from 2024
- References to deprecated features
- Examples that no longer apply
