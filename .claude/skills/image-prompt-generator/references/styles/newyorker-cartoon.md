## Visual Style

**Line Work:**
- Fine crosshatching ink illustration
- Soft, organic lines (not rigid digital precision)
- Minimal shading - let crosshatching do the work
- Soft vignette fade at edges (not hard borders)

**Format:**
- 1:1 square aspect ratio (ideal for social)
- Single panel only
- Clean white/cream background
- No color - pure black ink on white

**Caption:**
- Italic serif font (Garamond, Times, or similar)
- Centered below illustration
- One sentence only
- Period at end (not exclamation)

## Humor Elements

The New Yorker cartoon voice is:

1. **Understated** - The joke lands softly, not with a punchline
2. **Observational** - Notices absurdity in everyday life
3. **Detached irony** - Characters seem unaware of the absurdity
4. **Unexpected framing** - The caption does work the image doesn't

**What makes it funny:**
- Contrast between mundane setting and absurd detail
- Characters taking ridiculous things seriously
- Modern anxieties rendered in domestic scenes
- The reader feeling "seen" rather than laughing out loud

## Caption Formulas

**The Deadpan Observation:**
> "I liked learning better before we had to optimize it."

**The Overheard Conversation:**

**The Status Report:**
> "Good news - I've unlocked seventeen badges. Bad news - I still can't do long division."

**The Therapy Session:**
> "And when did you first realize the algorithm knew you better than you knew yourself?"
