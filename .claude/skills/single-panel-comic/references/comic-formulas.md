## Core Formula Structures

### Formula 1: The Competence vs. Credential

**Structure:** Someone/something demonstrating clear competence is confronted by bureaucracy demanding credentials.

**Template:**
> [COMPETENT FIGURE] doing [IMPRESSIVE SKILL]. [BUREAUCRAT] intervenes: "[CREDENTIAL DEMAND]."

**Examples:**
- Lion covered in hunting scars sits across from gazelle in HR. Gazelle: "Impressive resume, but we require a certificate."
- Caveman dad watching son make fire successfully. Bureaucrat taps shoulder: "Excuse me, do you have your teaching license?"
- Socrates teaching students under a tree. Bureaucrat: "I'm going to need to see your state certification."
- Bird with perfect nest she clearly built. Nearby: bird with PhD holding pile of sticks and reading "Nest Construction: A Theoretical Framework."

**Key tension:** Natural ability vs. institutional validation

---

### Formula 2: The Wrong Teacher

**Structure:** A creature is being taught something by the worst possible instructor for that subject.

**Template:**
> [STUDENT CREATURE] in a classroom. [COMPLETELY WRONG TEACHER] at the board teaching "[SUBJECT THE STUDENT SHOULD KNOW NATURALLY]."

**Examples:**
- Wolf pup at desk. Sheep at board: "Predator Studies" PowerPoint
- Eaglet in classroom. Penguin teacher: "Today we'll learn about flying."
- Bear cub at tiny desk, taking notes. Salmon teaching fishing. Mother bear watches through window, baffled. Sign: "CERTIFIED AQUATIC PROTEIN ACQUISITION SPECIALIST"

**Key tension:** The system prioritizing credentials over actual expertise

---

### Formula 3: The Factory/Industrial Process

**Structure:** Children literally processed through industrial machinery. Input diversity, output uniformity.

**Template:**
> [DIVERSE INPUTS] enter [INDUSTRIAL MACHINE]. [UNIFORM OUTPUTS] emerge. [LABEL FOR REJECTS].

**Examples:**
- Cookie cutter factory. Children of all shapes enter. Identical gingerbread shapes exit. Crumbled colorful pieces in bin labeled "extra stuff."
- Graduation stage leads directly into meat grinder. Banner: "CONGRATULATIONS - YOU'RE READY!" Parents weeping with pride.
- Assembly line: each station removes something. Signs above each: "CURIOSITY REMOVAL" → "WONDER EXTRACTION" → "QUESTION SUPPRESSION"
- Conveyor belt with unique snowflakes entering, identical ice cubes exiting

**Key tension:** Standardization destroying individuality

---

### Formula 4: The Deathbed Clarity

**Structure:** End-of-life perspective revealing the absurdity of how time was spent.

**Template:**
> [FIGURE] on deathbed/in afterlife. Final words or revelation about [THING WE WASTE LIFE DOING].

**Examples:**
- Ed the horse on deathbed: "I wish I spent more of my youth memorizing answers."
- Heaven's gates. Angel with clipboard: "It says here you spent 14,000 hours preparing for tests about things you immediately forgot."
- Graduation cap and gown on skeleton in rocking chair. Photo album open to page: "SCHOOL PHOTOS - GRADES K-12"

**Key tension:** What matters vs. what we spend our time on

---

### Formula 5: The Medical Diagnosis

**Structure:** Natural human qualities treated as conditions requiring removal or treatment.

**Template:**
> Medical setting. [DOCTOR/EXPERT] shows [DIAGNOSTIC IMAGE]. Diagnosis: [NATURAL QUALITY] must be [REMOVED/TREATED].

**Examples:**
- Doctor holds X-ray showing heart, imagination clouds, wonder. "Good news - we can remove all of this before first grade."
- Prescription pad: "Rx: 12 years sitting still. Twice daily testing. No refills on curiosity."
- Child in waiting room. Doctor holds chart: "The curiosity levels are dangerously high."
- Brain scan with "QUESTIONS" region highlighted. Doctor: "We'll need to suppress this area."

**Key tension:** Treating humanity as a defect

---

### Formula 6: The Two Grades / Hidden Truth

**Structure:** The official version vs. the real version. What's celebrated vs. what's actually valued.

**Template:**
> Two [DOCUMENTS/VERSIONS]. Official: [CELEBRATED METRICS]. Hidden: [ACTUAL COST].

**Examples:**
- Two report cards. Official: "A+ in COMPLIANCE, A+ in SITTING STILL." Crumpled: "F in CURIOSITY, F in WONDER, F in WILL TO LIVE." Teacher: "Your parents will be so proud!"
- Two doors. "LEARNING" - dusty, cobwebbed, unused. "CREDENTIALS" - worn smooth, line out the door.
- Progress report with checkmarks for everything except "WILL TO LEARN" (blank)

**Key tension:** What we say we value vs. what we actually measure

---

### Formula 7: The Venn Diagram of Stakeholders

**Structure:** Multiple parties with different agendas. The child stuck in the tiny overlap.

**Template:**
> Venn diagram with overlapping circles. Each circle: [STAKEHOLDER]: [ACTUAL WANT]. Tiny overlap in center: [THE CHILD/STUDENT].

**Examples:**
- Circles: "PARENTS: Want Face" + "TEACHERS: Want Paycheck" + "ADMIN: Want No Problems" + "GOVERNMENT: Want Compliance." Tiny overlap: child at desk. Label: "EDUCATION."

**Key tension:** The student as afterthought in their own education

---

### Formula 8: The Format Compliance

**Structure:** Natural, correct answer rejected for not following arbitrary procedure.

**Template:**
> [FIGURE] presents [CORRECT/NATURAL RESULT]. Authority rejects it: [FORMAT/PROCEDURE COMPLAINT].

**Examples:**
- Cat proudly presents dead bird to classmates. Teacher (also cat): "Nice effort, but you're supposed to use the MLA format."
- Child's beautiful finger painting. Teacher marking it: "No rubric alignment. C-."
- Student shows working math solution. Teacher: "You didn't show your work the way we taught it."

**Key tension:** Process valued over outcome

---

### Formula 9: The Ironic Sign/Label

**Structure:** A sign or label that reveals the absurdity through its own earnestness.

**Template:**
> Scene with [IRONIC SIGN] that names what's actually happening.

**Examples:**
- Bear teaching cub to fish in river. Sign: "UNLICENSED EDUCATION - REPORT TO AUTHORITIES"
- Factory processing children. Sign: "PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY (EST. 1892)"
- School entrance. Sign: "THROUGH THESE DOORS WALK THE LEADERS OF TOMORROW." Kids visible inside, heads down, filling in bubbles.

**Key tension:** What institutions say vs. what they do

---

### Formula 10: The Historical Anachronism

**Structure:** Famous historical teacher/learner confronted with modern bureaucracy.

**Template:**
> [HISTORICAL FIGURE] doing their famous [LEARNING/TEACHING]. Modern bureaucracy intervenes.

**Examples:**
- Socrates teaching under tree. Bureaucrat: "State certification, please."
- Leonardo da Vinci's workshop. Inspector: "This isn't an accredited program."
- Young Einstein daydreaming. Teacher: "Stop imagining and focus on the test."
- Wright Brothers' workshop. Sign: "CLOSED - AVIATION INSTRUCTOR LICENSE REQUIRED"

**Key tension:** How we'd have stifled the geniuses we now celebrate

---

## Thematic Clusters

### Animals Teaching Animals (Wrong)
Use predator/prey or ability/inability contrasts:
- Penguin teaching eagles to fly
- Sheep teaching wolves to hunt
- Fish teaching bears to catch salmon
- Turtle teaching rabbits to run

### Ed the Horse (Recurring Character)
Our mascot as everyman experiencing the system:
- Ed on deathbed regretting memorization
- Ed holding two report cards
- Ed in a Venn diagram center
- Young Ed → Teenage Ed → Adult Ed evolution

### The Clipboard Bureaucrat
A recurring antagonist archetype:
- Tapping shoulders
- Checking credentials
- Taking notes
- Blocking natural learning

### The Proud Parents (Tragic)
Parents celebrating the wrong things:
- Weeping with pride at graduation → meat grinder
- Reaching for compliance report card (ignoring curiosity one)
- Photo album of standardized test scores

---

## Caption Rhythm Guide

### The Reveal
Set up normalcy, then punch with absurdity.
> Good news → we can remove all of this before first grade.

### The Bureaucratic
Formal language applied to the natural.
> I'm going to need to see → your state certification.

### The Matter-of-Fact
Dark truth stated without emotion.
> 14,000 hours preparing for tests → about things you immediately forgot.

### The Regret
Simple, devastating clarity.
> I wish I spent more of my youth → memorizing answers.

### The Label
Let the sign do the work.
> "EXTRA STUFF" (on reject bin)
> "CREDENTIALS" (on worn door)

## Generating New Ideas

### Start with a tension:
1. Natural learning vs. institutional control
2. Competence vs. credentials
3. Individual vs. standard
4. Curiosity vs. compliance
5. Present sacrifice vs. future payoff
6. What we say vs. what we do

### Then apply a formula:
- Who demonstrates the tension? (animal, child, historical figure, Ed)
- What's the setting? (classroom, office, factory, afterlife)
- Who's the antagonist? (bureaucrat, teacher, system, sign)
- What's the single line? (apply caption rhythm)

### Test with:
- Can I picture it in one frame?
- Would Sarah screenshot and share this?
- Does it make you feel "seen"?
- Is it dark but not cruel?
