## THOUGHT Archetypes

### 1. THE PARABLE (Best performer)
Story with embedded lesson. Reader discovers the insight through narrative, not lecture.

> An old man lived alone. One day, local kids start throwing rocks at his house. Instead of yelling, he offers them a dollar each to come back tomorrow. They do. Next day, fifty cents. Then a quarter. Finally, he says he can't afford to pay them anymore. The kids, now feeling underpaid, never return.

Pattern: [Surprising situation] → [Counterintuitive action] → [Unexpected resolution] → [Reader draws conclusion]

### 2. THE VIVID ANALOGY
Maps education concepts onto familiar objects.

> Homeschooling used to mean a specific thing. Now it's like 'cable' - a bundle of options (co-ops, pods, tutors, online courses) that you assemble yourself.

Pattern: [Old understanding] → [New reality] → [Clarifying metaphor]

### 3. THE SUBVERSIVE REFRAME
Concede the conventional view, then flip it.

> Schools say they're preparing kids for the real world. But Ansel Adams's mother pulled him OUT of school precisely because the real world - nature, exploration, self-direction - couldn't be found inside one.

Pattern: [Acknowledge common belief] → [Historical example that subverts it] → [New frame]

### 4. THE GUT-PUNCH QUOTE
Let someone else deliver the insight.

> A mother shares her child's question: "Mommy, did you get distracted too?" after being pulled from traditional school.

Pattern: [Brief setup] → [Powerful quote] → [Let it land without over-explaining]

### 5. THE ONE-LINER
Single sentence that reframes everything. Rare, but devastating when done right.

> "Education isn't filling a bucket. It's lighting a fire."

Only use when you find genuine gold. Don't manufacture these.

## TREND Archetypes

### 1. ALARMING STAT + HUMAN VOICE
Data creates urgency; human story creates connection.

> 83% of parents believe schools aren't preparing kids for the AI economy. But talk to Maria Gonzales in Houston, and it's not abstract: "My son's math teacher spent three months on a unit the Khan Academy covered in two weeks."

Pattern: [Stat] → [Named person + location] → [Direct quote]

### 2. FOLLOW THE SMART MONEY
What are sophisticated actors actually doing?

> When you hear what Google executives are doing with their own kids' education, it makes you wonder what they know that they're not telling us.

Pattern: [High-status group] + [Surprising behavior] → [Implication]

### 3. HISTORICAL PARALLEL
Today's trend maps onto past movements.

Pattern: [Current trend] → [Historical parallel] → [What happened then] → [What it suggests now]

### 4. CONCRETE CASE STUDY
One family, one school, one district - told in detail.

> The Johnsons in Tampa have three kids in three different arrangements: one full-time homeschool, one hybrid with the district, one in a microschool. Here's how they make it work.

Pattern: [Family/school name] + [Location] + [Specific arrangement] + [How/why]

## TOOL Archetypes

### 1. HOW-TO IN DISGUISE
Don't describe the tool - show how to use it.

> Open your state's ESA application portal. Click 'Account Setup.' Before you fill in anything, do this first...

Pattern: [Immediate action verb] + [Specific first step] + [One useful tip]

### 2. PERSONAL ENDORSEMENT
You or a named source vouches for it.

> I've tried every transcript tool. This is the only one I still use three months later.

Pattern: [Credibility statement] + [Specific endorsement] + [Why it stuck]

### 3. PROBLEM-SOLUTION FRAME
Name the pain point first.

> Tracking learning across three different platforms is a nightmare. Until you discover [Tool], which...

Pattern: [Specific pain point] + [Tool introduction] + [How it solves it]

### 4. "WE TRIED THIS" ENDORSEMENT
Team/community validation.

> Three of our team members ran their curriculum through [Tool] last month. Here's what they found...

Pattern: [Group who tried it] + [Results/findings] → [Recommendation]
