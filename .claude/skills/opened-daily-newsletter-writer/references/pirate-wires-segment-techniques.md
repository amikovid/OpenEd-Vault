# Pirate Wires Techniques for TTT Segments

A la carte techniques for writing THOUGHT, TREND, and TOOL segments with authentic voice. Pick the technique that matches your content.

## Technique 1: Calling Out the Obvious

**What it is:** Say what everyone knows but won't admit.

### Full Example (Pirate Wires)

> "A new MIT study claims LLM users 'consistently underperform' on neural and linguistic tests - and AI doomers are obsessed. A professor on Bluesky declares the 'death knell' of AI, and normies are 'terrified' ChatGPT will rot our brains. **Of course, none of them read the 206-page report**, which reveals 18 college students had 20min to write essays based on (boring) SAT prompts using only ChatGPT. They could barely recall what they 'wrote,' meaning they just copy/pasted, lol, and their brain activity diminished. **I mean, obviously, doing nothing tanks your brain activity (thank you, science)**."

### Why It Works

- "Of course, none of them read..." - States the obvious truth
- "(thank you, science)" - Parenthetical sarcasm
- Makes the reader feel seen - they knew this too

### Apply To:

| Segment | Use When | Example Frame |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **THOUGHT** | Calling out conventional wisdom | "Of course, the experts don't homeschool their own kids..." |
| **TREND** | Media spin on data | "Of course, the headline doesn't mention the sample size..." |
| **TOOL** | Obvious gap the tool fills | "Obviously, parents have been doing this manually for years..." |

## Technique 2: The "You're the Problem" Flip

**What it is:** Show how the people complaining are the ones causing the issue.

### Full Example (Pirate Wires)

> "Two things: unstructured time is the fundamental substrate for creativity. And, uh, have you guys tried just... dealing with this? Take away their devices. Give them chores. Chalk. Challenges. You don't have to pay for your kids to play outside. You can just force them to, for free. Take it from my boomer dad, who used to lock us out of the house in 100-degree heat. When we were thirsty, we drank from the hose, and nobody died lol. **O accursed parents of modernity, you've forgotten that you guys are literally adults.** Make choices, face consequences. It's gonna be OK."

### Why It Works

- Flips responsibility to the complainer
- "O accursed parents of modernity" - Dramatic but funny
- Ends with reassurance after the tough love

### Apply To:

| Segment | Use When | Example Frame |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **THOUGHT** | Parents/schools blame external factors | "Wait - who told you that you need permission to teach your own child?" |
| **TREND** | Data shows people cause their own problems | "The irony: the parents worried about 'socialization' are the ones isolating their kids in age-sorted classrooms." |
| **TOOL** | Tool solves a self-created problem | "For years we've outsourced curriculum decisions to strangers. Here's how to take them back." |

---

## Technique 3: The Absurdity Framework

**What it is:** Take something overblown and describe it with exaggerated gravity. Let the absurdity speak for itself.

### Full Example (Pirate Wires)

> "Jenifer Hanki - a... *shudders* cyclist in San Francisco - is suing Waymo, claiming its 'Safe Exit' system failed when a passenger doored her as she pedaled down Seventh Street, injuring her and causing 'emotional distress.' Hanki described the horror: 'The curb-side Waymo's left passenger door suddenly swung open directly in the bike lane... with no room or time to react, I crashed violently into the door' **(cue tiny violin)**. Now, this story isn't just about one stupid lady trying to cash in on her own obliviousness, folks. **It's the defining struggle of our time. A spiritual war between the forces of progress and innovation**, embodied in the innocent, noble Waymo, and the cancerous menace that is the urban cyclist."

### Why It Works

- "(cue tiny violin)" - Parenthetical dismissal
- "the defining struggle of our time" - Exaggerated gravity
- The contrast makes the absurdity obvious

### Apply To:

| Segment | Use When | Example Frame |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **THOUGHT** | Overblown education panic | "This isn't just a curriculum choice. It's the defining struggle of our time. A spiritual war between [exaggerated framing]." |
| **TREND** | Media treats minor thing as crisis | "The panic: homeschooled kids might miss prom (cue tiny violin). The reality: [actual data]." |
| **TOOL** | Tool solves fake problem | "[Tool] finally addresses... waiting for your kid to finish a worksheet. The horror." |

---

## Technique 4: Setup and Punch

**What it is:** Serious setup, unexpected punch line.

### Full Example (Pirate Wires)

> "Stop the presses: unlike every paternity test he's ever taken, Elon's recent drug test has turned up NEGATIVE, folks (yes, even for ketamine). That's according to a recent tweet from the Tesla boss/Epstein truther showing off his lab results, a direct rebuttal to a New York Times article from last month alleging Elon was abusing multiple drugs while supporting Trump on the campaign trail."

### Why It Works

- "unlike every paternity test" - Unexpected comparison
- "(yes, even for ketamine)" - Parenthetical that adds specificity
- The formal language contrasts with the absurd content

### Apply To:

| Segment | Use When | Example Frame |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **THOUGHT** | Contrarian take with sting | "After years of research, education experts have finally discovered what homeschool parents knew in 1985: kids learn better when they're interested." |
| **TREND** | Data reveals obvious truth | "Breaking: children who read more become better readers. Scientists are baffled." |
| **TOOL** | Tool does something surprisingly simple | "Revolutionary new technology allows parents to... check what their kids are actually learning. (It's called looking over their shoulder.)" |

---

## Technique 5: The "Let's Be Honest" Approach

**What it is:** Cut through BS and admit motivations, biases, or truths that sound cynical but are actually honest.

### Full Example (Pirate Wires)

> "Last week, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati raised $2 billion in seed funding (!) for her stealth AI startup, Thinking Machines Lab, valuing the six-month-old company at around $10 billion with, from best I can tell, no product or business... I think it's safe to say we've reached the 'irrational exuberance' stage of the AI hype cycle - but let's remember these guys are trying to catalyze a utopian singularity, which probably can't be overhyped? Then, just in terms of the salaries, **I'm glad America is paying our star nerds more than our star basketball players (finally). Sorry haters, the only problem I see here is my own slow start.**"

### Why It Works

- "from best I can tell, no product or business" - Parenthetical honesty
- "I'm glad..." - Unapologetically takes a position
- "Sorry haters" - Casual dismissal of objectors

### Apply To:

| Segment | Use When | Example Frame |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **THOUGHT** | Admitting an unpopular opinion | "Sorry haters, but I'd rather my kid be happy than impressive. That's it. That's the philosophy." |
| **TREND** | Acknowledging the uncomfortable implication | "Let's be honest: this data means some kids are being failed by adults who mean well. That's harder to fix than blaming the system." |
| **TOOL** | Being honest about tradeoffs | "Look, this tool isn't cheap. But compared to private tutors, it's a steal. (I'm not sponsored. I just did the math.)" |

---

## Technique 6: Institutional Critique

**What it is:** Question why institutions act the way they do - without becoming preachy.

### Full Example (Pirate Wires)

> "Last week, a video of Obama giving a fireside chat where he says Twitter will need to be regulated, because it allows 'hateful' and 'polarizing' speech, made the rounds on X. 'We want diversity of opinion, [not] diversity of facts... It will require some government regulatory constraints,' he said. I don't need to tell you where I stand on reinstating the f***ing Ministry of Truth, but I do have one question. **Why are institutionalists like Obama SO pathologically fixated on restricting the free flow of information??** They don't even justify it anymore (aside from referencing ambiguous concepts like 'protecting democracy') - it's creepy!"

### Why It Works

- "I don't need to tell you where I stand" - Assumes shared understanding
- "SO pathologically fixated" - Genuine puzzlement, not lecture
- "it's creepy!" - Simple, visceral reaction

### Apply To:

| Segment | Use When | Example Frame |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **THOUGHT** | Questioning why schools do X | "I don't need to tell you my thoughts on [policy], but one question: why are school boards so pathologically fixated on [thing]? They don't even justify it anymore." |
| **TREND** | Data shows institutional failure | "Schools have known about [research] for 20 years. Why haven't they changed? (The answer is depressing.)" |
| **TOOL** | Tool routes around institutions | "Parents used to need permission for [thing]. This tool lets them just... do it." |

---

## Technique 7: The Ironic Contrast

**What it is:** Show the gap between what's prioritized and what actually matters.

### Full Example (Pirate Wires)

> "Bay Area electrical engineer Patrick McCabe has created an app called Solve SF that allows city residents to file 311 reports about issues like poop on the sidewalk (#JustSFThings) in as little as 10 seconds, far faster than the city's official 311 app. Unfortunately, **because nice things are illegal in San Francisco**, the city is about to effectively shut down Solve SF when they discontinue use of the API it runs on, citing maintenance costs to keep the API running **(don't worry, there's still budget for needle distribution / grants towards transgender musical theater non-profits)**."

### Why It Works

- "because nice things are illegal" - Pithy summary of dysfunction
- The parenthetical contrast between what gets funded
- Doesn't need to explain why it's absurd - the contrast speaks

### Apply To:

| Segment | Use When | Example Frame |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **THOUGHT** | School priorities vs. kid outcomes | "The district cut recess to add test prep. (Don't worry, there's still budget for the new football stadium.)" |
| **TREND** | Resource allocation data | "Schools spent $X on [thing]. Meanwhile, [obvious need] remains unfunded. Because nice things are apparently illegal." |
| **TOOL** | Tool fills gap institutions ignore | "The school spends millions on [thing]. This free tool does what they won't." |

## Quick Reference: When to Use Each

| Technique | Best For | Segment Fit |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Calling Out Obvious** | Exposing what everyone knows | All, esp. TREND |
| **You're the Problem** | Challenging readers to act | THOUGHT |
| **Absurdity Framework** | Media panics, overreaction | TREND, THOUGHT |
| **Setup and Punch** | Revealing obvious truth | All |
| **Let's Be Honest** | Unpopular but true takes | THOUGHT |
| **Institutional Critique** | Why systems fail | THOUGHT, TREND |
| **Ironic Contrast** | Resource/priority gaps | TREND, TOOL |

---

## Parenthetical Asides (Use 1-2 Per Segment Max)

**Patterns:**

- "(cue tiny violin)" - Dismissal
- "(thank you, science)" - Sarcastic credit
- "(from best I can tell, [observation])" - Honest aside
- "(yes, even for [specific])" - Emphasis
- "(don't worry, there's still budget for [ironic thing])" - Contrast
- "#Just[Place]Things" - Hashtag joke
- "*shudders*" - Reaction

---

## Casual Interjections (Sparingly)

- "lol" - After absurd observation
- "Look:" - Before real-talk moment
- "I mean," - Before obvious point
- "uh," - Fake hesitation for effect
- "And, uh, have you guys tried..." - Challenge framing

---

## Family-Friendly Adaptations

Replace crude language with:
- "freaking" instead of stronger
- Implied rather than stated
- "Let's just say..." for euphemism
- Focus on irony over shock

Keep:
- Parenthetical asides
- Ironic gravity
- "lol" (sparingly)
- Direct address
- Strong point of view
