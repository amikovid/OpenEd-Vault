# Archived Skills - Pre-Refactor Backup

**Archived:** 2026-01-23
**Reason:** Content Engine Q3 Strategy Refactor

These skills were preserved before the content engine refactor. The SKILL.md files have been renamed to SKILL.archived.md to prevent automatic invocation.

## Archived Skills

| Skill | Original Purpose |
|-------|------------------|
| text-content | 360+ text post templates for social platforms |
| quality-loop | 5-judge quality gate system |
| podcast-production | 4-checkpoint podcast workflow |
| x-posting | X/Twitter posting with guest tagging |
| opened-daily-newsletter-writer | Mon-Thu daily newsletter (Thought-Trend-Tool) |

## Why Archived

The refactor introduces:
- Framework fitting as core technique (sub-agents per platform)
- TEMPLATE_INDEX.md for lightweight template loading
- Universal quality loop triggers
- Parallel sub-agent execution pattern

## To Restore

If you need to restore any skill:
1. Copy the folder back to `.claude/skills/`
2. Rename `SKILL.archived.md` back to `SKILL.md`
