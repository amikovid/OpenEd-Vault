# 10 Commandments of Engagement Checklist

A systematic checklist for optimizing hooks and headlines based on proven psychological principles.

## How to Use This Checklist

**Purpose:** Evaluate and improve your top 5-7 hook variations before final selection

**Workflow:**
1. Generate 10+ hook variations (Phase 2 of main skill)
2. Select top 5-7 based on frameworks used
3. Run each through this checklist
4. Score: Count how many commandments each hook applies (aim for 4-6)
5. Optimize: Add missing commandments where natural
6. Select: Choose hook with highest score + best fit

**Important:** You don't need all 10 in every hook. Aim for 4-6. More than 7 risks feeling manipulative.

## Commandment 1: Numbers and Statistics

### Principle
Use specific numbers to add credibility and reduce vagueness

### Why It Works
- Brain processes numbers faster than words
- Specificity implies accuracy and research
- Concrete vs abstract (easier to visualize)
- Creates curiosity ("Why that specific number?")

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook include a specific number?
- [ ] Are percentages, dollar amounts, or timeframes included?
- [ ] Have I avoided vague words like "many," "some," "lots"?
- [ ] Is the number realistic and accurate?

### Examples

**Without numbers:**
- "Many students are enrolled in microschools now"
- "Lots of people are making this mistake"
- "Save time with these tips"

**With numbers:**
- "1.5 million students are enrolled in microschools now"
- "90% of new homeschoolers make this mistake"
- "Save 100+ hours with these 7 tips"

### Types of Numbers to Use
- Percentages: "76% satisfaction rate"
- Dollar amounts: "$12,000 saved per year"
- Timeframes: "In 90 days"
- Quantities: "7 strategies"
- Specific results: "From 100 to 10,000 followers"
- Ratios: "1 teacher, 8 students"

## Commandment 2: Negativity Bias

### Principle
Highlight potential losses, mistakes, or negative consequences

### Why It Works
- Humans are wired to avoid loss more than seek gain
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) is powerful motivator
- Mistakes are more memorable than successes
- Creates urgency ("I need to fix this")

### Examples

**Positive framing only:**
- "How to succeed at homeschooling"

**Negativity bias applied:**
- "The costly mistake 90% of homeschoolers make"

### Ways to Apply
- **Mistake focus:** "Are you making this [X] mistake?"
- **Loss aversion:** "What [inaction] is costing you"
- **Warning:** "Before you [action], read this"

---

## Commandment 3: Pattern Interrupt

### Principle
Challenge common beliefs, practices, or expectations

### Why It Works
- Breaks through scrolling/scanning autopilot
- Creates cognitive dissonance ("Wait, what?")
- Signals non-obvious content
- Makes reader pause and reconsider

### Examples

**Expected/conventional:**
- "Why you should plan your homeschool year"

**Pattern interrupt:**
- "The less you plan, the more they learn"

---

## Commandment 4: Target Callout

### Principle
Directly address your specific audience by name or situation

### Why It Works
- Immediate self-selection ("This is for me")
- Increases relevance perception
- Cuts through noise for niche audiences

### Examples

**Generic audience:**
- "Tips for better learning"

**Target callout:**
- "Homeschool parents: Stop replicating public school at home"

---

## Commandment 5: Problem Callout

### Principle
Identify the specific pain point, struggle, or obstacle immediately

### Why It Works
- Shows you understand their struggle
- Creates instant relatability
- Signals relevant solution incoming

### Examples

**Vague or no problem:**
- "Tips for homeschooling"

**Problem callout:**
- "Tired of your kid begging not to go to school?"

---

## Commandment 6: Confidence and Conviction

### Principle
Use strong, assertive language; eliminate hedge words

### Why It Works
- Confidence is persuasive
- Certainty reduces decision friction
- Reader wants decisive guidance, not maybes

### Hedge Words to Eliminate
- Maybe, might, could, possibly, probably, perhaps
- I think, I believe, in my opinion (when unnecessary)
- Sort of, kind of, somewhat, fairly

---

## Commandment 7: Aesthetics

### Principle
Ensure visual appeal and readability

### For Newsletter Subject Lines:
1. **35-50 characters ideal** (mobile preview)
2. **No line breaks** (won't work in subject lines)
3. **Clear even when truncated**

---

## Commandment 8: Potential Benefit

### Principle
Clearly state what the reader will gain

### Why It Works
- Answers "What's in it for me?" immediately
- Reduces uncertainty about value
- Clear ROI compels click

### Examples

**Unclear/no benefit:**
- "Things about homeschooling"

**Clear benefit:**
- "How to cut homeschool costs by $10,000/year"

---

## Commandment 9: Social Proof

### Principle
Leverage authority, popularity, or third-party validation

### Why It Works
- Reduces risk perception
- Borrowed credibility
- "If it worked for them..." (vicarious success)

### Examples

**No social proof:**
- "How to grow a microschool"

**With social proof:**
- "How Kelly Smith grew Prenda to 10,000 students"

---

## Commandment 10: Warning and Caution

### Principle
Create sense of urgency or importance through warning

### Why It Works
- Signals critical information
- Creates FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Implies reader might be at risk

### Examples

**No urgency:**
- "Tips for homeschooling"

**Warning/urgency:**
- "Before you buy curriculum, read this"

## Scoring Your Hooks

For each hook variation, count how many commandments apply:

**10/10:** Probably overkill, may feel manipulative
**7-9/10:** Very strong, high engagement likely
**4-6/10:** Good, aim for this range
**2-3/10:** Weak, needs optimization
**0-1/10:** Generic, start over

### Example Scoring

**Hook:** "1.5 million students are in microschools now. Here's why."

Commandments applied:
1. ✅ Numbers (1.5 million)
2. ❌ Negativity bias
3. ✅ Pattern interrupt ("surprising")
4. ❌ Target callout
5. ❌ Problem callout
6. ✅ Confidence ("Here's")
7. ✅ Aesthetics (clean, short)
8. ✅ Benefit (will learn "why")
9. ✅ Social proof (scale = 1.5M)
10. ❌ Warning

**Score: 6/10** - Strong hook

## Common Combinations for Subject Lines

**Target + Problem:**
"Homeschool parents: Tired of curriculum overwhelm?"

**Numbers + Social Proof:**
"1,000+ families use this system"

**Warning + Benefit:**
"Before you buy curriculum (save yourself $1,000)"

**Confidence + Pattern Interrupt:**
"Forget everything you know. Here's what works:"
