Creating balance in sentence structure through parallel phrases.

[Noun 1] [verb] [object]. [Noun 2] [verb] [object].

- [ ] **Would I quote this to a friend?** (Quotability test)
- [ ] **Does it sound good read aloud?** (Rhythm test)
- [ ] **Is the meaning immediately clear?** (Clarity test)
- [ ] **Is it under 50 characters?** (Mobile preview test)

If 4/5 pass, you have a sticky subject line.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Forcing it** - If it doesn't flow naturally, it won't sound good
❌ **Sacrificing clarity for style** - Sticky means nothing if unclear
❌ **Overusing rhyme** - Can sound childish
❌ **Being too clever** - "Be clear, not clever"
