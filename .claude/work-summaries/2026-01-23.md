**Today (retrospective):**

• Created a Slack integration that posts finished social content to #market-daily as threaded replies - makes it easier to review and approve posts before scheduling

• Built out 5 new workflow guides:
  - Newsletter-to-social router (turns one newsletter into platform-specific posts)
  - Archive content suggester (surfaces old content worth resharing)
  - Slack social distribution (the #market-daily integration)
  - Newsletter subject lines (dedicated guide with proven formulas)
  - Article titles (SEO-focused headline writing for blog posts)

• Created a comprehensive visual map of our entire content production system - shows how podcasts, newsletters, and deep dives flow into social content

• Streamlined 6 workflow documents, cutting about 8,400 words of redundancy while keeping the useful parts:
  - Daily newsletter guide (37% smaller)
  - Ghostwriter guide (64% smaller)
  - Meta ads guide (63% smaller)
  - Podcast production (29% smaller)
  - Cold open creator (61% smaller)

• Fixed broken links between documentation files that were causing confusion when jumping between workflows

• Updated 8 contact profiles with their social media handles for easier tagging in posts
