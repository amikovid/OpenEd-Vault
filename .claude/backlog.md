## HIGH Priority

### Social-First Newsletter Approach
**Status**: TODO
**Added**: 2025-12-31

Update the daily newsletter writing skill to draft social media posts for the three segments BEFORE drafting the actual newsletter. This inverts the current flow and may produce tighter, more shareable content.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Locate current newsletter skill/workflow
- [ ] Add step: "Draft 3 social posts (one per segment) before writing newsletter"
- [ ] Test on next newsletter cycle
- [ ] Evaluate if social-first produces better hooks

**Note**: Run this to improve the daily writer skill.
