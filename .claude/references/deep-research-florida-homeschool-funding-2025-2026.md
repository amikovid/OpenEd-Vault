## Executive Summary

For the 2025-2026 school year, Florida continues to operate one of the most expansive school choice environments in the United States. Following the universal expansion of scholarship programs under House Bill 1 (2023) and subsequent adjustments in the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, nearly every Florida family is now eligible for state-funded educational assistance. However, the mechanism by which "homeschool" families access these funds has bifurcated into two distinct legal categories with different rights, responsibilities, and funding sources.

**Top 5 Takeaways for Florida Homeschool Families:**

1.  **The "PEP" Distinction is Critical:** To access the general scholarship funds (approx. $7,800-$8,000) for home-based education, families must enroll in the **Personalized Education Program (PEP)**. Legally, PEP students are *not* considered "home education" students under Florida Statute 1002.41; they are considered a distinct category of parent-directed students. This requires terminating a Letter of Intent with the school district and subjects the student to annual standardized testing requirements rather than portfolio reviews.
2.  **Universal Eligibility with Priority Tiers:** The income cap for the Florida Tax Credit (FTC) and Family Empowerment Scholarship for Educational Options (FES-EO) has been eliminated. However, funding is prioritized first for families earning 185% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) or below, and secondarily for those up to 400% FPL. Wealthier families are eligible but are funded last.
3.  **FES-UA Remains Separate and Higher Value:** The Family Empowerment Scholarship for Students with Unique Abilities (FES-UA) remains a distinct program. Unlike PEP, FES-UA students *may* retain their legal status as statutory homeschoolers (1002.41) while receiving funds. The average award is higher (approx. $10,000+), and eligibility is based on diagnosis rather than income.
4.  **New Worlds Scholarship Funding Freeze:** Significant legislative changes for the 2025-2026 fiscal year indicate that **no new funding** has been allocated for the New Worlds Scholarship Accounts (reading/math support). No new scholarships will be awarded for 2025-2026; only existing funds in established accounts may be utilized before they expire due to inactivity.
5.  **Strict Application Deadlines:** For the 2025-2026 school year, the PEP program is capped at 100,000 students. The priority deadline for applications is **April 30, 2025**. Applications submitted after this date run a high risk of being waitlisted or denied due to the cap and funding limits.

## 1. Personalized Education Program (PEP) / Florida Tax Credit (FTC)
*Note: This is the primary funding vehicle for general homeschoolers.*

The Personalized Education Program (PEP) is the designated track for families who wish to direct their child's education at home using state scholarship funds. It functions as an Education Savings Account (ESA).

### Funding Amounts
For the 2025-2026 school year, the average scholarship amount is projected to be approximately **$7,800 to $8,000 per student**. This amount varies slightly by county and grade level.

### Eligibility and Capacity
*   **Universal Eligibility:** There are no income limits for eligibility, though priority is given to lower-income households.
*   **Capacity Cap:** The program is limited to **100,000 students** for the 2025-2026 school year. This is an increase from previous years, but once the cap is reached, no further students will be funded.
*   **Age:** Students must be age 5 by September 1, 2025, for Kindergarten eligibility.

### Legal Status (The "Gotcha")
Accepting PEP funds requires a change in legal status. Parents **must withdraw** their student from the district-registered Home Education Program (statute 1002.41) and register as a PEP student with a Scholarship Funding Organization (SFO) like Step Up For Students.
*   **Implication:** You are no longer legally a "homeschooler" in the eyes of the state; you are a "PEP student." You lose the right to use a portfolio evaluation for annual compliance. You must submit a Student Learning Plan (SLP) to the SFO.

### Approved Expenses
PEP funds are deposited into an ESA (Education Savings Account) and can be used for:
*   Instructional materials and curriculum.
*   Tuition and fees for part-time tutoring.
*   Virtual programs and online courses.
*   Standardized testing fees (Norm-referenced tests, AP exams).
*   Contracted services from public schools (if available).
*   Choice Navigators.

### Florida Virtual School (FLVS) Interaction
PEP students are considered private-paying students for Florida Virtual School. They **cannot** access FLVS Flex for free. They must use their scholarship funds to pay tuition, which is approximately **$375 per half-credit segment**.

## 2. Family Empowerment Scholarship for Students with Unique Abilities (FES-UA)
*Note: This program is for students with special needs/diagnoses.*

FES-UA is distinct from PEP and provides higher funding levels to support students with disabilities. It operates as an ESA.

### Funding Amounts
*   **Average Award:** Approximately **$10,000** annually.
*   **Matrix-Based Funding:** Students with more severe disabilities (Matrix scores 254 or 255) can receive significantly more, averaging between **$22,000 and $34,000**.
*   **Cap:** There is a cap on the total number of students, increasing annually by 3% of the state's total ESE enrollment plus 1%.

### Eligibility Criteria
To qualify, a student must be 3 years old (by Sept 1) through grade 12 (or age 22) and have a diagnosis from a physician or psychologist, or an IEP. Qualifying conditions include, but are not limited to:
*   Autism Spectrum Disorder
*   Down Syndrome
*   Cerebral Palsy
*   Intellectual Disability
*   Specific Learning Disabilities (Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, etc.)
*   Anaphylaxis
*   Speech/Language Impairment
*   Rare diseases.

### Legal Status
Unlike PEP, FES-UA students **may** retain their status as a "Home Education Program" student under Florida Statute 1002.41.
*   **Benefit:** These students can continue to use portfolio reviews for annual evaluations and maintain the legal protections of traditional homeschooling while receiving funding.
*   **Stacking Ban:** A student cannot receive both FES-UA and PEP funds simultaneously.

### Approved Expenses
*   Instructional materials and curriculum.
*   Specialized therapies (Speech, OT, PT, ABA).
*   Private tutoring.
*   Technology (laptops/tablets) necessary for education.
*   Specialized services (VPK, summer programs).
*   Contributions to a Stanley G. Tate Florida Prepaid College Program.

## 3. Family Empowerment Scholarship for Educational Options (FES-EO)
*Note: Primarily for private school tuition.*

While FES-EO is the "universal voucher" for private school tuition, its relevance to homeschoolers is strictly through its interaction with PEP.
*   **Usage:** FES-EO funds are generally restricted to tuition and fees at participating private schools.
*   **Homeschool Access:** Families wishing to use these funds for home education must apply under the **PEP** category of the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship. FES-EO itself does not offer a direct "cash for homeschool" option outside of the PEP framework.
*   **Transportation:** FES-EO students attending a public school out of district may receive a transportation stipend of **$750**.

## 4. Other Programs (Hope, New Worlds, etc.)

### The Hope Scholarship
*   **Purpose:** For students who have been victims of bullying, harassment, battery, or other violent incidents at a public school.
*   **2025 Status:** Students who received the Hope Scholarship in 2023-24 are eligible to transfer into the PEP program.
*   **Usage:** Primarily allows transfer to a private school or another public school. It is not typically a standalone "homeschool funding" source for curriculum unless the student transfers into the PEP program using their Hope eligibility.

### New Worlds Scholarship Accounts (Reading/Math)
*   **2025-2026 Status:** **NO NEW FUNDING.** The Florida Legislature did not allocate new funds for the 2025-2026 fiscal year.
*   **Implication:** No new scholarships will be awarded. Existing accounts with remaining balances may continue to spend funds, but accounts will close after one year of inactivity (July 1, 2025 - July 1, 2026).
*   **Previous Value:** Was $1,200 per student for reading/math support.

### Gardiner & McKay Scholarships
*   **Status:** These programs have been permanently merged into the **FES-UA** program. They no longer exist as separate entities.

## 6. Program Interactions & Stacking

*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** A student **cannot** hold multiple scholarships simultaneously. You cannot have PEP and FES-UA at the same time. You cannot have FES-EO (private school) and PEP (home) at the same time.
*   **Siblings:** Scholarship eligibility is determined per student. One child can be on PEP, while a sibling with a disability is on FES-UA, and another sibling attends a private school on FES-EO.
*   **Public School:** Participation in PEP or FES-UA (as an ESA) generally precludes full-time enrollment in public school. If a student enrolls full-time in public school, the scholarship is forfeited.

## 7. Homeschool-Specific "Gotchas" & Risks

### 1. The Legal Status Change (PEP)
This is the most frequent point of confusion.
*   **Traditional Homeschooling (1002.41):** Parents file a letter of intent with the county. They have 5 options for annual evaluation (psychological eval, portfolio review by teacher, testing, etc.).
*   **PEP Status:** Parents register with Step Up For Students (SFO). They **must** terminate the county letter of intent.
    *   **The Risk:** You lose the flexibility of the portfolio review. PEP students **must** take a state-approved norm-referenced test annually and submit results to the SFO. Failure to do so can result in loss of funding.

### 2. Florida Virtual School (FLVS) Costs
*   **Traditional Homeschoolers:** FLVS Flex is free.
*   **Scholarship (PEP/FES) Students:** FLVS Flex is **not free**. State law prevents "double dipping" (receiving scholarship funds + free state education). Families must use their scholarship funds to pay FLVS tuition (~$375 per segment/semester).

### 3. Reimbursement vs. Direct Pay
*   **FES-UA:** Often allows direct purchasing through the MyScholarShop/EMA marketplace for approved vendors.
*   **PEP:** Is primarily a **reimbursement** model for many expenses, though direct purchasing is available for specific vendors. Parents often must front the money for curriculum and submit receipts. Processing times can be slow.

### 4. Inactivity Rules
*   Funds can roll over from year to year, but accounts with inactivity (no spending) for specific periods (now 1 year for New Worlds, varies for others) may be closed and funds returned to the state.

## 8. Application Process & Timeline (2025-2026)

### Where to Apply
Applications are processed through **Scholarship Funding Organizations (SFOs)**. The two primary SFOs in Florida are:
1.  **Step Up For Students:** [www.stepupforstudents.org](https://www.stepupforstudents.org)
2.  **AAA Scholarship Foundation:** [www.aaascholarships.org](https://www.aaascholarships.org)

### Key Deadlines
*   **Application Opening:** February 1, 2025 (for new and renewal families).
*   **Priority Deadline:** **April 30, 2025**.
    *   **PEP:** Applications submitted after April 30 run a high risk of rejection due to the 100,000 student cap.
    *   **FES-UA/EO:** Renewal families must apply by April 30 to ensure funding continuity. Late renewals are processed as new applicants and may be waitlisted.

### Application Steps
1.  **Create Account:** Set up an account in the **EMA (Education Market Assistant)** portal (for Step Up). *Note: Returning users must create a NEW account for the 2025-26 system update*.
2.  **Gather Documents:** Proof of residency, birth certificates, and (for FES-UA) diagnosis documentation/IEP.
3.  **Submit Application:** Select the specific program (PEP or FES-UA). Do not apply for both for the same student.
4.  **Award Notification:** Processing can take several weeks. Once awarded, you must "Accept" the scholarship in the portal.
5.  **Withdrawal (PEP Only):** Once funded/accepted, formally withdraw your student from the county Home Education office to avoid truancy/duplicate enrollment issues.
6.  **Student Learning Plan (PEP Only):** Submit the required SLP to the SFO detailing your educational goals.

### Processing Times
*   Typical processing is 3-4 weeks, but during peak times (March-May), it can extend longer.
*   Funding is distributed quarterly (Sept 1, Nov 1, Feb 1, April 1).
