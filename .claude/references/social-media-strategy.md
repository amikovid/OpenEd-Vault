# OpenEd Social Media Strategy & Playbook

**Purpose:** Transform OpenEd's hub content (newsletters, podcasts, articles) into high-performing social posts that drive engagement, subscribers, and brand awareness.

**Philosophy:** Be the transfer of enthusiasm. Human soul, sense of humor, strong POV. Less corporate cringe, more pirate wires energy.

1. **Framework Fitting** - Match content to proven social frameworks
2. **Platform Optimization** - Each platform has unique winning formats
3. **Call-to-Action Engineering** - Drive engagement with "DM for this" strategies
4. **Organic Infiltration** - Reddit and community engagement strategy

## Platform Playbooks

### 1. LinkedIn: Comment-to-Get Strategy

**Primary Format:** Tease valuable resources, drive DM engagement

**3-Step Process:**
1. **Hook Selection** (5 options):
   - "Steal our [process] for [outcome]"
   - "[Number] mistakes everyone makes with [topic]"
   - "The [shocking] truth about [topic]"
   - "I wish I knew this [timeframe] ago"
   - "Why [controversial statement] is actually true"

2. **Bullet Benefits** (4 specific outcomes):
   - "The exact 12-word prompt we use to..."
   - "Our proven workflow that saves 3 hours..."
   - "The step-by-step setup for..."
   - "A counterintuitive method for..."

3. **CTA Keywords**:
   - GUIDE, TEMPLATE, TOOLKIT, PLAYBOOK, CHEATSHEET

**Example Flow:**
```
Hook: "We analyzed 239 OpenEd newsletters. The top performers all had THIS."

Context: After tracking engagement across our daily newsletters for 6 months, we discovered a pattern that 3x'd our open rates.

Value: I've compiled everything into a guide with:
• The 7-part newsletter formula we now use daily
• Our subject line testing spreadsheet (with 147 winners)
• The exact send time matrix by audience segment
• A swipe file of our top 20 newsletters

Like this post and comment "FORMULA" and I'll DM you the guide (must be connected).
```

**Leverage existing skills:**
- `linkedin-content` - 118 frameworks
- `hook-and-headline-writing` - Hook formulas

### 2. Facebook: Visual Controversy

**Winning Formats:**
1. **Text on Plain Background** (using `dude-with-sign-writer` patterns)
   - "Normalize letting kids learn at their own pace"
   - "Traditional school: Where creativity goes to die"
   - "My kid learned more from YouTube than textbooks this year"

2. **Carousel Posts** (3-5 images):
   - Before/After transformations
   - Step-by-step guides
   - Myth-busting series

3. **Controversy Drivers**:
   - Parent hot takes
   - Education system callouts
   - Success stories that challenge norms

### 3. Instagram: Reels Without Recording

**Low-Effort, High-Impact Formats:**

1. **Text-Over-Stock** (no face required):
   - Use trending audio
   - Text reveals timed to beat
   - Stock footage of kids learning/playing

2. **Carousel Guides**:
   - Swipe through tips
   - Visual statistics
   - Before/after comparisons

3. **Screenshot Stories**:
   - Parent testimonials
   - Student success metrics
   - Curriculum comparisons

**Hook Formula for Reels:**
- Visual: Eye-catching first frame

- Caption: Full value + CTA

### 4. Reddit: Organic Infiltration Bot

**Engagement Triggers:**

- "Is homeschooling right for..." threads

**Response Framework:**
```
Acknowledge → Share Experience → Soft Resource Drop

"I totally get this frustration. We went through the same thing with our daughter struggling in traditional school. 

What ended up working for us was [specific anecdote from OpenEd content]. The flexibility to adjust pace made all the difference.

If you're exploring alternatives, I actually wrote up our whole journey and what we learned - happy to share if helpful. Also check out [specific non-promotional advice]."
```

**Bot Intelligence:**

### 5. Twitter/X: Thread Machines

- Day-in-the-life threads
- Statistical revelation threads

### 6. TikTok: Educational Entertainment

**No-Face Formats:**
1. **Text-over-video** tutorials
2. **Screenshot carousels** with voiceover
3. **Whiteboard** explanations
4. **Before/after** transformations

**Hook Types:**
- "POV: You just discovered kids don't need 8 hours in a classroom"
- "Things that live rent-free in homeschool parents' heads"
- "Tell me you're an alternative education family without telling me"

### 7. Pinterest: SEO Gold Mine

**Strategy:** Create pinnable content from every article

## Content Multiplication Workflow

### Phase 1: Extract Core Value
From any hub piece, identify:
- 3-5 key insights
- 1-2 compelling stories
- 2-3 surprising statistics
- 1 controversial take
- 1 transformation example

### Phase 2: Framework Fitting
Match extracted value to frameworks:
- LinkedIn: Which of 118 frameworks fits?
- Facebook: Controversy or visual?
- Instagram: Carousel or reel?
- Reddit: Which pain point does this solve?

### Phase 3: Platform Optimization
Create platform-specific versions:
- Adjust length (Twitter: 280, LinkedIn: 3000)
- Add platform conventions (hashtags, @mentions)
- Include native CTAs

### Phase 4: Proliferation
Use SCAMPER method for variations:
- **S**ubstitute: Change the angle
- **C**ombine: Mix with another insight  
- **A**dapt: Fit to trending format
- **M**odify: Adjust tone/audience
- **P**ut to other uses: Different platform
- **E**liminate: Simplify to core
- **R**everse: Flip the perspective

## Voice Guidelines: Anti-Cringe Principles

### Do This:
- **Transfer enthusiasm** - If you're not excited, why should they be?
- **Specific > Generic** - "237 parents" not "many parents"
- **Stories > Statistics** - But use both
- **Controversy with compassion** - Challenge systems, not people
- **Humor when natural** - Dad jokes > forced wit
- **Real examples** - Pull from actual Slack conversations

### Don't Do This:
- "In today's fast-paced world..." (AI tell)
- "Let's talk about..." (Just talk about it)
- "🚀 Exciting news! 🎉" (Emoji overload)
- Corporate speak disguised as casual
- Humble brags disguised as lessons
- Generic motivation without specifics

## Engagement Strategies

### 1. DM Funnel System
**Goal:** Build relationships, not just broadcast

**Triggers:**
- "Comment [KEYWORD] for guide"
- "DM me 'STORY' for the full case study"
- "Send 👋 if you want the template"

**Follow-up Sequence:**
1. Auto-send requested resource
2. Ask qualifying question
3. Invite to newsletter/community
4. Track conversion to subscriber

### 2. Community Infiltration Ethics
**Do:**
- Provide genuine value first
- Share real experiences
- Build relationships
- Vary engagement patterns

**Don't:**
- Spam links
- Copy/paste responses
- Ignore community rules
- Be overly promotional

### 3. Content Calendar Integration
**Weekly Rhythm:**
- Monday: Newsletter → LinkedIn post
- Tuesday: Reddit engagement day
- Wednesday: Podcast → Thread + Reels
- Thursday: Newsletter → FB controversy
- Friday: Week recap → Pinterest batch

## Metrics That Matter

### Vanity Metrics (Track but don't optimize for):
- Likes, hearts, thumbs up
- Follower count
- View count

### Real Metrics (Optimize for these):
- DM conversations started
- Email subscribers from social
