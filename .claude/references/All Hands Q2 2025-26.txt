Listen for the sounds of pain.
Because…
To raise the bar, we need to be resilient.
To be resilient, we need to make hard choices.
Hard choices allow us to do our best at what we do best.

OpenEd Foundation
with Teresa King

Q2 Attainment 
Total enrollment count for OEA is at 900 students as we close out Q2.  The Academy was approved for Alabama ESA but due to decisions there, virtual private schools will be relegated to “service provider” status and not private school status.  So while our work to become approved there was successful, and has the green light here, our ability to leverage the full ESA award amount for families there has been impacted.  We did have a pivot in place for Fall 26 that we will focus on full steam ahead.  More on that in the following slides. Q2 goals had Missouri as our main target state for building self-pay family growth in Academy and while much of this work has been done, we did not begin outreach before Dec 30 so this is a yellow light status and I’ll expand more on that in the learnings slide.

Q2 Insights & Learnings
Expect uncertainty and have a plan B

Customer (parent) delight wins the day
Creating targets for spending our energy and money on market efforts gets challenging when it feels like those targets are moving.  The way to work within DOE frameworks is to expect uncertainty and have a plan B.  This is also why you’ve seen OpenEd make an effort to partner with more than one district in each new state.  The vagaries of this work demand contingency planning.  So you won’t see Alabama or Missouri on the q3 goals, both states fell off the targeted list due to circumstances or strategic decisions made.  But the customer is constant–and our focus on creating and sustaining delight in the families we serve is constant.  As a result, no matter which states we target for growth, we take with us the testimonials and referrals of the people who are most likely to be listened to by parents in a new market– other parents just like them.

Q3 Targets & Objectives
Q3 Goals
Q3 Metric/KPI
Achieve at least one new state ESA approval
Texas approval secured
Move in to new, targeted markets: TX, TN (pending lawsuit), one addl state as Inc partner
State approvals in place and outreach started
MSA final accreditation
Awarded final accreditation in Q3 visit
OEA will be setting a goal to gain Texas ESA approval during Q3 (but it may not come until April).  Texas treats virtual private schools as private schools and awards approx $10,000 per private school student, with parents able to fund their Odyssey wallet with the remainder funds.  So we will be moving in to market there with news and education about that option.  Riding right alongside that goal and its associated activity is our plan to enter Tennessee with a watchful eye on litigation there, and secure one additional state approval before the end of Q3. Speaking of watchful eyes, many are currently turned toward Utah’s legislative session and that includes mine.  And very little of this will be possible if OEA does not secure final accreditation assurance during the month of January.  

People QBR 
With Brit Laughlin
Let's dive into what we accomplished and where we're headed. Spoiler alert: we hired a lot of people and kept most of them.

Q2 Attainment 
90% - Talent Pipelines/Headcount Planning We hit 90% here, which honestly feels like an A- in the real world, and other priorities allowed us to shift this goal. We built strong pipelines for RISE and Teacher pools, and saw a notable decrease in stress with finding teachers for fast turnaround needs, and enabled a TON of internal growth.
We’re tee’d up with some top of funnel DITL videos to be completed in Q3. 
100% - Launch Engagement & Development Awesome execution on engagement and development initiatives. This was a gigantic group effort by so many colleagues outside of the Poeple Team. Huge shoutout to Carrie Hendricks, Sunny, Maryn, Ela, Alex, Jared Colleen and members of the GroundCrew for bringing such great momentum and engagement to things like holiday and wellness team challenges, swag photo contests and Monthly yoga experiences on the first of each month, as well as the currently running Peer Mentorship Program! 
100% - Open Enrollment Another 100%! Open enrollment went off without a hitch. Everyone got their benefits,      no one accidentally enrolled their cat in our health insurance, and the 401k didn't implode. Wins all around. 
Other:
eNPS - Q1 eNPS score of 70 with response rate of 82% (we will run another eNPS following this QBR)
Glassdoor - generated 18 reviews Oct - Dec; company rating is up to 4.8 (up from 4.7 last quarter)




Q2 Insights & Learnings
11 Biz Staff Hires We brought on 11 business team members and 41 Teachers this quarter with a 7.7% Turnover rate. 
7.7% turnover within the quarter is actually really solid for a growth company in education. Industry average hovers around 13-16% annually, so we're tracking well below that even with all our rapid growth. What this tells us is that when people join OpenEd, they tend to stick around. That's a direct reflection of our culture, our mission, and possibly our benefits package. 
But the insight is that with 52 total hires, losing a small percentage for various reasons means our hiring quality is strong! That being said, we still need to stay vigilant on onboarding and early-tenure engagement as that first 90 days is critical.
So, we continue to obsess over onboarding and enablement quality. And continue to recognize that sustained growth without recovery periods will eventually catch up to us, which is exactly why peer mentorship, staff development and building a resilient learning culture are priorities next quarter.



Q3 Targets & Objectives
Quick overview of how we're organizing our work:
Getting the right people in the door
Making sure they're set up to thrive
Building an environment where everyone grows
Keeping the wheels on the bus and the lawyers happy
On Talent Pipelines - The Leadership team had an awesome opportunity to do some live headcount planning, and we continue to get more predictable and repeatable in the way that we shape our teams. We continue to stay focused on optimizing talent pipelines, headcount planning, and ensuring appropriate ramp time for top performance.
We're aiming for sub-33-day time to fill, which for context is pretty aggressive, (most education companies run 45-60 days), and our unique population and hiring culture makes this number difficult to measure. We're also getting ahead of planning for the half because Q4 is always heavy! 
Engagement & DevelopmentFirst-ever peer mentorship cohort launched this quarter. We're also planning Camp OpenEd, which I'm pretty sure will be the best team-building event we've ever done! 
Culture of Learning: Foster curiosity through continued development huddles, leader development, stronger visibility into Division-wide metrics, and creating a shared learning resource library for employees and new hires. Think, Isaac sending us Fridays with Ed book, but even MORE learnings from across the organization, and in the WIKI. 
Year-End Compliance Possibly the least sexy part of People Ops, but someone's gotta make sure the 1095s, W-2s, 1099s, and 401k reporting all happen, and Colleen is the queen that ensures it does. (Speaking of, your W-2’s are now available for download in Bamboo!) 
Thank you, Colleen, for always doing your best to avoid a cumbersome audit!

Q2 Insights & Learnings
You can’t meaningfully deviate from a standard that doesn’t exist.
And you can’t measure something that hasn’t been defined. So instead of measuring the health of our programs, we spent the quarter documenting what they are supposed to look like. 
And we learned exactly how hard it is. I think Karen has re-written the section on assessment at least once a month! But the conversations it takes to get to each re-write are elevating who we are as a business. They are bringing clarity to an ambiguous and high stakes corner of our world.

Operations Q2BR 
with Adam N. Burke 
This is a quick reminder that behind every dashboard and workflow is a real family trying to make the best decision they can.
Our job in Ops is to make the system do the hard work, so people don’t have to.

Q2 Attainment 
✅ ServiceHub launched & stabilized
🟡 Post-enrollment engagement workflows improved
✅ Curriculum fulfillment timeline shortened
🟡 Operational readiness for Fall surge
In Q2, we focused on stabilizing core systems, not adding noise. We successfully launched Service Hub, improved engagement workflows, and shortened fulfillment timelines. The remaining yellow areas are exactly where we’re focusing next - readiness and capacity clarity for Fall.

Q2 Insights & Learnings
Growth shows what breaks first
Ownership matters more than tooling
Automation worked best when invisible
Earlier Ops involvement saves time later

The biggest takeaway wasn’t about tools. It was about clarity. Growth exposed weak points fast, and when ownership was clear and automation stayed invisible, things held. Getting Ops involved earlier consistently reduced downstream friction.

Q3 Targets & Objectives
Pillar 1
Fix foundations, not symptoms
Lock metrics, SLAs, and capacity thresholds
Pillar 2
Fewer one-offs, clearer ownership
Reduce bespoke workflows across enrollment
Pillar 3
Enable scale without friction
Prepare systems for sustained Fall volume

Fix foundations, not systems
Q3 is about making the system harder to break. Less reacting, fewer exceptions, clearer ownership, and foundations that can handle sustained volume without relying on heroics.

For Q3, Operations is committing to outcomes we can clearly score.
We’ll deliver an authoritative enrollment data model, make Success effort and speed measurable, define and launch an Evidence of Engagement score for students, and define and ship a parent health score.
Together, these give us clear visibility into enrollment accuracy, team effectiveness, student engagement, and parent experience. If we hit these four, we’ll know the system is accurate, measurable, and ready to optimize in Q4

Q3 North Star
ONE SYSTEM THAT WORKS - YEAR OVER YEAR
Scaleable
Manageable
Reusable
If Ops does its job right, no one needs to think about how the system works. It just works - year over year.

Closing Remarks
With Jared Fuller
Chief Operating Officer

6 months ago

There was celebration

But also…

frustration


So, we intro’d our theme for the year

Resilience over Brilliance

And we discussed 


 Easy to. .Vary .

 Easy to. .Vary .
 to→. 

 Easy to. .Vary .
 to→. 
 Hard to. .Vary .

If we’re honest, we’re still nowhere near Raptor 3

For H2, we need to concretize what “hard to vary” and “resilient” actually means

So we can do more celebrating without everything being so frustrating

Let’s spot “easy to vary” in our daily work
Ad hoc decisions, bespoke workflows, exceptions
Knowledge trapped in people
“We’ll remember,” “we just have to this time,” 

= 

Fragile. And fragile is frustrating.
90.3% CSAT
95.3% of reimbursements processed within 10 business days

And also spot “hard to vary” in our daily work
Clear definitions, templates, playbooks, and checklists
Decision rules + owners
Single source of truth
System produces the outcome, not the person

=

Resilient. That’s what we celebrate.
90.3% CSAT

Now let’s make them actionable

3 Ways & CTA’s for Building Resilient& Hard to Vary

Name the invariants – Ways
Make the most important things non-negotiable.
“If it matters, define it. If it’s defined, measure it.”
Examples of invariants:
What “done” means (definition of Done)
What “quality” means (acceptance criteria)
What “priority” means (a ranking rule)
What “good customer experience” means (response time, tickets per pupil, time to value, conversion rates, etc)
90.3% CSAT
95.3% of reimbursements processed within 10 business days

Name the invariants – CTAs
Publish 3 team invariants (definitions + targets) on one page.
Pick one metric you’ll protect even during chaos.
90.3% CSAT
95.3% of reimbursements processed within 10 business days

2.   Delete variation – Ways
Remove degrees of freedom.
“Variation is where failures hide.”
“Standardize the 80% so you can be creative in the 20%.”
Raptor engine callback: reduce parts, reduce interfaces, reduce exceptions.
90.3% CSAT
95.3% of reimbursements processed within 10 business days

2.   Delete variation – CTAs
Run the “Delete / Default / Automate” test on one process/workflow:
Delete steps that don’t change outcomes
Add a default (template, rule, SLA, owner)
Automate the check
Kill one recurring exception by turning it into a rule or a process/workflow change.
Replace “ask {X} person” with a decision rule (even a simple one).
90.3% CSAT
95.3% of reimbursements processed within 10 business days

3.   Add self-healing loops – Ways
Resilient systems detect drift and correct it fast.
“Speed of recovery beats avoiding every failure.”
“The goal isn’t zero problems. It’s small problems that don’t compound.”
“Every incident should pay rent” (it produces a permanent improvement).
90.3% CSAT
95.3% of reimbursements processed within 10 business days

3.   Add self-healing loops – CTAs
For any miss: do a 10-minute retro with one output:
“What do we change so this can’t happen the same way twice?”
Create/refresh for the top 3 recurring issues.
Add a quality gate where errors are cheapest (before handoff, before launch, before sending).
90.3% CSAT
95.3% of reimbursements processed within 10 business days

Celebrating to stop Frustrating
Name the invariants
Delete variation
Add self-healing loops

Let’s make Q3 resilient 

 And do the best and most important work of our lives, because our families trust us with the best and most important part of theirs…

❤️ their kids 💙

Opening the world for every learner.
