## Legal Nuance (Important for Content)

When enrolled in OpenEd, families are technically **students of an accredited program**, not "homeschoolers" under state law. This means:
- Different (often simpler) legal requirements
- OpenEd handles compliance paperwork
- But families still **identify culturally as homeschoolers**

**Content positioning:** Emphasize flexibility and at-home education without stripping homeschool identity.
