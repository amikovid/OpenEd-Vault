# Chapter 11: Beyond the Box: The Great Education Unbundling

## Summary
This chapter examines the shift from all-or-nothing educational choices (public, private, or homeschool) to à la carte, customized education. Using a controversy over ESA-funded LEGO bricks, it traces the evolution from Milton Friedman's voucher idea through Ivan Illich's "learning webs" to today's Education Savings Accounts. The chapter shows how Utah families, primed by 15 years of open education culture, use ESAs to customize learning rather than just buying private school tuition.

## Key Tags
- education-unbundling, flexibility, choice, ESA, marketplace, solutions

## Key Concepts
- False binary: public school, private school, or homeschool (all-or-nothing)
- COVID forced "behind-the-curtain" view of education - exposed limitations
- Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) allow flexible spending on any educational expense
- 14 states now have ESA programs; this trend accelerating
- Ivan Illich's 1970 "learning webs" vision is now reality (YouTube, Coursera, Outschool, etc.)
- Utah's unique approach: 80% of ESA families customized education vs. simple private school tuition
- Market design problem: current systems clunky; need better platforms to match services

## The LEGO Brick Debate

In Arizona, a teacher was furious that ESA families could buy $500 LEGO sets. He'd spent a month applying for grants to buy off-brand LEGOs for his classroom.

Derrell Bradford's response: "If you want ESA families to have less freedom, the problem isn't ESAs. It's that public school teachers have too little freedom. Start there."

The real question: Who gets to decide what "counts" as educational? Why trust some people but not others? When does a toy become learning tool?

## Isaac's LEGO Education

Isaac played LEGO about half the time from ages 4-13 while homeschooled. Mom wanted structured rigorous curriculum but had three stubborn kids and a disabled husband to care for. Result: minimal consistent structured learning.

Isaac would speed through Saxon Math worksheets (miserable, not comprehending) to get back to LEGO. He felt worried that "real school kids" would be ahead of him.

That day never came. "Real school kids" suffered while he played LEGO. By the time he went to school, they weren't better for their suffering.

Only later did he realize: LEGO was more valuable than the math.
- Algebra taught: solve for X on paper
- LEGO taught: solve for building X-wing without all pieces
- Textbooks gave: gold stars for right answers
- LEGO taught: create actual value others appreciate
- Formal education: follow instructions
- LEGO: work within natural constraints while exercising creative freedom

## Escaping the False Binary

For decades: pick from public school, private school, or homeschool. Each all-or-nothing proposition. This limited choices because you had to pick between pre-packaged systems rather than craft what works.

Parents stare like you've suggested building a rocket when you mention combining approaches. "You can do that?"

It's like ordering "off-menu" at restaurants - we thought everyone had to pick what was listed. Never realizing we could ask for modifications.

COVID exposed the kitchen. Parents saw behind the curtain for the first time:
- Second grader breezes through math in 20 minutes, struggles hours with writing
- Teenager comes alive during hands-on projects but zones out in lectures
- Kindergartener learns better after running outside, not sitting still

Parents who never would have considered alternatives started asking "Why not?" when forced to be education designers by necessity.

Families began crafting solutions:
- Utah: morning homeschool + afternoon enrichment classes at district
- Florida: two days/week microschool + online courses + sports leagues

## Not Your Uncle Milton's School Choice

Milton Friedman's 1950s voucher idea: let parents take state education funding and use it at school of choice. Competition and choice increase quality and drive down prices.

Problem: only offered choice between public and private (which cost 2x as much). For many families, this didn't significantly expand options. Critics pointed to "cream-skimming" effect where resourceful parents could navigate the system, leaving others with fewer options.

Ivan Illich's 1970 radical addition: what if learners connected directly with teachers and resources through "learning webs"?
- Catalog of learning materials anyone could access
- Skill exchanges where people teach what they know
- Peer-matching to find others wanting to learn same things
- Directory of teachers rated by previous learners

Seemed utopian at the time. Institutions were too entrenched. Learning without schools seemed dangerous, anarchic.

Technology of his era couldn't fully realize it. But he was remarkably prescient - described interconnected "learning webs" decades before internet. Today, we live in his world: YouTube teachers, Coursera, Khan Academy, Outschool (teachers reviewed by hundreds of families).

## Education Savings Accounts Evolution

Modern ESAs evolved from old vouchers. Instead of picking between School A and School B, parents get digital wallets for ANY educational expense:
- Tutoring
- Learning pods
- Specialized therapy
- Curriculum materials
- Online courses
- LEGO sets (!)

## A Quiet Revolution

According to Brookings: public schools lost 1.2 million students since 2020. Even after pandemic restrictions lifted, many never returned.

14 states now have ESA programs like Arizona's. In just half a decade: from fringe idea to mainstream policy. Transformation seemed impossible just years ago.

### Utah's Unique Model

When Utah launched universal ESAs ("Utah Fits All" scholarship), something unexpected happened. In most states, vast majority use funds for private school tuition.

Utah: different. Thanks to OpenEd's 15-year presence, families already comfortable mixing/matching educational ingredients. Had been experimenting with customized education. Word of mouth normalized education design.

Result: Nearly 80% of ESA families customized children's education rather than simply paying private school tuition.

Given choice between $12,000/year private school or crafting custom combination, many chose custom. They'd learned they could often create better educational experience at fraction of private school spending per pupil.

Michael Horn's metaphor: Henry Ford Model T. "Any color as long as it's black" was great - it's an automobile. But once people realized they could choose colors or seating, customization became norm. "Choice becomes more viable as consumers get more experience with it."

## Building Real Markets

Catch: while parents ready to customize, marketplaces aren't quite there. Most state ESA programs centrally administered like 2002 DMV website. Clunky bureaucracy = many parents default to private school (easier than navigating mazes).

We need platforms making education customization as easy as booking Airbnb. Need passionate experts becoming educational entrepreneurs.

## Trust in the Learning Marketplace

Skeptics raise valid concerns: quality assurance, preventing fraud. But we handle this in other areas. Yelp/Google Reviews for restaurants. Similar frameworks could work for education providers.

We need reputation-based systems helping parents evaluate providers while maintaining organic, human-scale interactions making learning come alive.
