# Chapter 12: Building Your Open Education Plan

## Summary
The final substantive chapter guides families from understanding the open education philosophy to actually implementing it. Using The LEGO Movie's Master Builders as a metaphor for moving from instruction-following to creative thinking, it introduces the Open Education Plan (OEP) - a flexible framework that provides structure while enabling creativity. The chapter emphasizes that structure doesn't limit freedom; it enables it.

## Key Concepts
- Open Education Plan (OEP): organized LEGO table metaphor - find and try pieces without limiting creativity
- Structure enables, not constrains (organized kitchen empowers cooking creativity)
- OEP evolves as child grows (unschooling → structured homeschool → part-time traditional + activities)
- Emmet vs. Master Builder: instruction-follower vs. seeing infinite possibilities
- "The only rule is to be awesome" - LEGO Movie wisdom about creative education
- Balance: you don't have to figure everything out at once

## The Emmet vs. Master Builder Paradigm

The LEGO Movie opens with Emmet, a construction worker living entirely by instruction manual. "Instructions come first." He follows every rule perfectly. Faced with crisis and no step-by-step directions? Paralyzed.

This mirrors homeschooling expos surrounded by:
- Curriculum catalogs
- Scope-and-sequence charts
- Daily lesson planners
- Educational consultants
- All promising perfect roadmap to success

Easy to get stuck in "Emmet mode," searching for official instructions telling exactly how to build perfect education.

But Master Builders don't see individual bricks. They see possibilities. Where Emmet sees strict steps, they see infinite combinations. "The only rule is to be awesome!"

The LEGO Movie's profound moment: instructions aren't source of creativity - they often block it.

### Why This Matters

In Utah, when families given freedom to choose (through ESAs), many didn't just buy the box. They started combining pieces from different sets to build something entirely new.

This is the Master Builder mindset applied to education.

## What Is an Open Education Plan?

An OEP is your way of making sense of all those pieces without limiting creative potential. Not rigid schedule or predetermined path - more like well-organized LEGO table where you find and set pieces into place while trying out new things.

Isn't planning opposite of being open? No. Structure doesn't limit freedom; it enables it.

**Kitchen metaphor**: Organized kitchen empowers creative cooking. You find ingredients quickly, experiment confidently, clean up easily. Disorganized kitchen creates frustration.

OEP works same way. It's not about constraining possibilities; it's about making them accessible.

### Evolution Over Time

Children's needs change. Students might start with complete unschooling in early years, transition to structured homeschooling in middle childhood, then blend part-time traditional school with outside activities in teens.

Others thrive in microschool one year, prefer independent study next. Beauty of OEP: it flexes and transforms along with your child.

You're not locked into one approach for entire educational journey.

### The Critical Piece

We're conditioned to think education as sequence of subjects and grade levels. We forget the most important piece: the unique child right in front of us.

Traditional education: pre-made LEGO set insisting every child build identical thing.

Open Education Plan: start with child's interests and help gather pieces they need to build their dreams.

## Starting the Conversation

Rather than looking for perfect instructions, the journey begins with recognizing your child's needs and building from there. This isn't something figured out overnight.

Key realization: you don't need a perfect plan to start. You need curiosity about what works for your specific child.
