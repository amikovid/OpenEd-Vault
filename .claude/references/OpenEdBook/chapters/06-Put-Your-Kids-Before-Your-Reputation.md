# Chapter 6: Building Block #2: Put Your Kids Before Your Reputation

## Summary
This chapter tackles the most insidious obstacle to open education: parental fear of social judgment. Using the story of a mother choosing to hide her son's entrepreneurial success (earning $4-5k/month at 18) while worrying about her depressed, unemployed college-graduate daughter, it exposes how parental pride and social status-seeking directly harm children's wellbeing. The chapter provides practical guidance for resisting social pressure.

## Key Story: The Invisible Problem

A mother tells Isaac: "I wish he was more like his sister."

Her son: 18, running lawn care business, earning $4-5k/month, confident, learning digital marketing, excited, independent, about to move into his own apartment.

Her daughter: Excellent student, straight A's, AP classes, college graduate with honors... unemployed 9 months later, moved back home, recently broken up, depressed, drowning in student debt, nobody hiring in her field.

The mother sees her happy, successful son as a cause for concern and her struggling daughter as evidence of good parenting. Why? Because college has become a proxy for success in social conversations.

### The Social Pressure Problem

At the barbecue: "How's Joey?" "He's in college!" → "Great!" (even if Joey is unhappy, in debt, learning nothing)

Versus: "He's working and trying different things" → Immediate shame, concerned looks, social judgment

This parental status-seeking is the #1 obstacle to open education - bigger than lack of money or opportunity.

### Starting Early

From birth, well-meaning relatives ask how much kids weigh, if they're walking, talking, reading, what grade they're in. Parents immediately feel pressure to have "normal" answers. Social panic kicks in, and we sacrifice our kids on the altar of acceptance.

At the grocery store, a toddler doesn't greet a stranger - our instinct is embarrassment and shame, not honoring our child's boundaries. We prioritize how strangers perceive our parenting over our actual duties to our children.

### The Charter School Story

Matt faced this head-on when his sixth-grade son asked to attend a new charter school. The community was divided. As a former public school teacher, Matt faced intense pushback from educator friends who accused him of being "anti-district." They questioned his commitment to traditional public schools.

Despite guilt-slinging and judgment, Matt and Amy stood firm. Their second son (6'8" and athletic) attended the charter school while his brother (6'6" and athletic) attended the district school. Parents lobbied hard: "You must move him to play with his brother and win a state basketball championship together."

They prioritized each child's happiness and preference over winning community approval. They've never regretted it.

### The Real Test

"How many kids are failing to learn and thrive due to irrelevant standardized test scores, only because their parents are too scared to be judged by others if they get a bad grade or skip the tests altogether?"

### It's Not Easy, But It's Worth It

If you open up your child's education, you will face doubt, skepticism, judgment - subtle and not-so-subtle. This will hurt. You'll start to doubt your path.

In those moments, always come back to your kids. Keep asking: what helps them thrive? When you know one direction is better, stick with it and suffer the social arrows necessary. That's your job.

You may lose social status in the broader world, but you'll gain standing among like-minded parents and educators. The feeling of less difficulty comes as you find your tribe.
