# Chapter 10: Open Education Pathways After High School

## Summary
This chapter tackles the disconnect between traditional college-for-all messaging and modern workforce realities. It examines how 62% of college graduates are underemployed or working in non-degree-requiring fields, while major employers drop degree requirements. The chapter explores alternatives including apprenticeships, entrepreneurship, competency-based early college programs, career/technical education, and skills-based hiring.

## Key Tags
- post-secondary, college-alternative, entrepreneurship, career-planning, ROI, real-world-skills

## Key Concepts
- Bicycle analogy: years of theoretical learning followed by real-world application
- 62% of college graduates either have no job or work in positions not requiring degree
- Enrollment in vocational community college jumped 16% since 2018
- Major employers (IBM, Accenture, Google, Bank of America) dropping degree requirements
- 10+ million jobs unfilled as of Feb 2024 in skilled trades/technical fields
- Early college programs: students earning college credits while in high school

## The Problem with Traditional College Path

Mike Rowe points out: "50% of people who start college don't finish." Worst of both worlds - substantial debt and no degree.

Even among graduates: 62% either have no job or work in positions not requiring a degree. This gap between education and employment is widening.

Meanwhile, employers want demonstrated excellence in ANY area. Not degrees, not GPAs - evidence of capability.

## Start with Why (Simon Sinek)

Too often students pursue degrees without understanding purpose. They focus on "what" (getting degree) and "how" (attending classes), missing fundamental "why."

This matters: "People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it."

For students, this means asking deeper questions:
- Why this path of study?
- How does it align with my personal goals and values?
- What impact do I want to make?

Starting with "why" leads to greater engagement, motivation, and ultimately success.

## Building Confident Learners (Antifragility)

Jonathan Haidt documents "the great rewiring of childhood" from play-based to phone-based, creating unprecedented mental health challenges. His Biosphere 2 story: trees grew quickly but fell over before reaching maturity because they lacked wind stress. Without stress, trees failed to develop strong roots and sturdy trunks. They lacked "reaction wood" - hardened wood formed in response to environmental stress.

This is education's parallel: if education is meant to prepare for real-world complexity, successful education would be "incredibly short and very hard to tell when it ended."

Nassim Taleb's "antifragility" concept: systems that become stronger when exposed to volatility and disorder. Applied to education: deliberately introduce controlled challenges and real-world experiences rather than creating smooth, predictable paths.

Entrepreneurship, with inherent uncertainties and challenges, is ideal for developing antifragility.

## Entrepreneurship Case Studies

**The Band's CFO**: A young man selling things on the street learned margins matter. His band made him CFO. He told his high school counselor: "I don't see the ROI for $X tuition for classes I don't want. I'll make money on my own instead." He did.

**Aiden Prout**: OpenEd student (K-12) started 3D gardening box business at 17. Using skills from OpenEd courses, he iterated product three times in first four months based on feedback. In 12 months: earned $150,000 (far exceeding $10,000 goal). Skills learned from creating real business aren't in textbooks.

## Alternative Pathways

### Competency-Based College Programs
SNHU-CBE partnership: high school students earn college credits through self-paced online program.
- $2,500/term, unlimited credits
- Project-based learning demonstrating skills vs. exams
- Students can complete multiple credits within 16 weeks if ready
- No hidden fees or textbook costs

### Career and Technical Education (CTE)
Modern CTE isn't shop classes of decades past. Encompasses wide disciplines with industry certifications alongside high school diploma. Programs like SkillsUSA host national competitions where tens of thousands showcase skills in welding, robotics, and more.

Virtual/augmented reality like Victory XR gives immersive taste of welding, machining without physical risks.

### Vocational Training
Culinary arts, cybersecurity, and more offer hands-on learners direct paths to lucrative careers. US Chamber of Commerce: 10+ million jobs unfilled as of Feb 2024, many in skilled trades.

### Apprenticeships
Many industries (especially trades) provide paid apprenticeships leading to stable, well-paying careers.

### Skills-Based Hiring

World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 highlights top skills employers expect increasingly important by 2027:
- Analytical thinking
- Creative thinking
- Resilience, flexibility, agility
- Motivation and self-awareness
- Curiosity and lifelong learning

These skills aren't tied to specific fields but universally valuable. Students need:
- Demonstrated excellence in ANY area (portfolio, case studies)
- Soft skills (communication, leadership, teamwork, adaptability, time management)
- Hands-on experience (internships, part-time jobs, volunteer work, personal projects)
- Interdisciplinary learning (ability to connect knowledge across fields)
- Creative problem-solving with complex, open-ended challenges

## The High School Diploma Question

High school diploma no longer required for college or career success. Contrary to fears, non-traditional paths don't close doors. Colleges increasingly recognize value of diverse backgrounds.

For non-traditional routes:
- Build compelling portfolio with detailed records of activities and achievements
- Leverage early college credits
- Standardized tests (SAT/ACT) still demonstrate college preparedness
- Soft skills (discipline, time management) valued equally to academic prowess
