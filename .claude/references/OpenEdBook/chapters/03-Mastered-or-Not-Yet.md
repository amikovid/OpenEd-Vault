# Chapter 3: "Mastered" or "Not Yet"?

## Summary
This chapter reframes learning and mastery away from letter grades toward competency-based assessment. Using elite athletes as examples (LeBron James, Roger Federer, Simone Biles would all be "failures" by academic grading standards), it shows how mastery actually develops through iteration, feedback, and the freedom to try again. The chapter introduces competency-based education and the power of "not yet."

## Key Tags
- competency-based-education, mastery, assessment, mindset, growth-mindset, grades

## Key Concepts
- LeBron James would be on academic probation (50% shooting = F)
- Mastery comes through iteration and improvement, not one-time performance
- Success isn't about never failing - it's about responding to failure
- The three elements of real learning: Choice, Competency, Connection
- "Not yet" mindset converts failures into learning opportunities
- Play-based learning with agency leads to 30% higher creative problem-solving

## Notable Examples
- Matt's daughter Eliza: completed associate degree in 14 months in competency-based program
- Isaac's Praxis program: oral exams with experts as alternative to traditional testing
- Olivia George: started Mountain Blue Doodles at 12, learned through real-world challenges
- Thygerson family: learned through travel (Nepal) and real projects, not textbooks

By academic standards, the greatest basketball players of all time would be failures. This reveals the fundamental problem: we've created a system that confuses measurement with meaning.

### Rethinking What Mastery Means

Real mastery doesn't work like a test. Athletes practice repeatedly, adjusting based on feedback. Musicians spend hours perfecting single phrases. Scientists build on failed experiments. Yet in education, an 89% is fundamentally different from 90%, with permanent labels following children through their careers.

Competency-based education asks: "Have you mastered it yet?" This means:
- Progress at your own pace
- Clear expectations from the start
- Multiple attempts encouraged
- Real-world application matters more than theory

### The Three Elements to Real Learning

Dr. Tanner Bowman identified that true learning happens at the intersection of three elements:

1. **Choice** - Some control over how, what, and when they learn
2. **Competency** - Adequate time, resources, and support to develop and master skills
3. **Connection** - Learning linked to topics that matter to them

When these come together, something remarkable happens.

### The Freedom to Be Less Than Perfect

Roger Federer loses nearly 50% of points played at the level. Rather than dwelling on every loss, he's learned: "It's only a point." This steady progress with room for mistakes beats high-pressure situations.

We're obsessed with optimization and excellence in every area - parenting, work, academics - creating a world where being less than the best feels like failure. But what if "good enough" in some areas freed us to focus on what matters most?

### The Power of "Not Yet"

Every great person is a "not yet" at countless things. We don't consider this failure when refs change calls based on replay - we call it progress. Yet education treats each attempt like a final verdict.

Learning happens through converting "not yets" into mastery. Some students will zip through subjects when motivated and ready. Others will take their time. Both are valid.

### Reimagining What's Possible

Logan LaPlante's TED talk "Hackschooling Makes Me Happy" captures the essence: when you grow up, what do you want to be? "Happy."

True learning happens when we see education not as a rigid system but as something we can actively shape and improve. A Zen saying: "To be happy, one must strive to become a master of a challenging skill which one enjoys doing." Add in "find a way to bless humankind with it" and the multiplier effect creates ripples of joy far beyond the learner.

### When Enough is Enough

The pressure to conform to traditional education creates "neijuan" (rat race leading to burnout) and "tang ping" (giving up entirely) - terms the Chinese invented to describe educational burnout.

Children's natural response of absenteeism is them "telling us something. How can we accommodate what they're telling us?" as UK children's laureate Anne Fine asks. The rigid system's power exists largely in our minds.
