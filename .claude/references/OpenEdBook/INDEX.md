**Building an Open Education: How to Reimagine Learning, Ignite Curiosity, and Prepare Your Kids for Success**
*Matt Bowman & Isaac Morehouse*

---

## Book Overview

This book challenges the 200-year-old standardized education model inherited from Prussian military training, exposing how it systematically standardizes children rather than develops their unique potential. It provides both philosophical critique and practical framework for open education - a personalized approach that recognizes each child's unique needs while maintaining high standards.

**Key Thesis**: Education should be customized to children's interests, needs, and circumstances - not the reverse. Five building blocks form the foundation for successful open education journeys.

### Introduction (Pre-Chapter)
Establishes the problem: 13,000+ hours in traditional schools where 2/3 of teachers are dissatisfied, parent satisfaction at 25-year low, and student anxiety/bullying rising. Sets up the opportunity: education is opening up for the first time in history.
