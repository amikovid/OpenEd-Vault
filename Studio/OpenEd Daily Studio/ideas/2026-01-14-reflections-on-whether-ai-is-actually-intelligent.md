## Summary

Michael Horn explores the philosophical and practical debate regarding whether artificial intelligence exhibits true intelligence or is simply a sophisticated statistical model. He concludes that regardless of the label, AI's ability to augment human capability has profound implications for the future of learning.

## Key Points

- The debate centers on whether AI is a 'stochastic parrot' or possesses emergent reasoning capabilities.
- Intelligence is often defined by the ability to solve problems and adapt, which AI is increasingly demonstrating in specific domains.
- The focus should shift from the semantic definition of intelligence to how these tools can be effectively integrated into educational frameworks.
