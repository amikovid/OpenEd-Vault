Greetings Eddies!

There's a question hiding under a lot of today's education coverage:

**Can parents be trusted?**

Every time a big outlet runs a story about a homeschooled student who "fell behind," the implication is the same: when families are left to themselves, kids get shortchanged.

These pieces follow a familiar pattern. Spotlight an anecdote. Quietly generalize it into a warning label. Skip the part that would actually help readers think clearly: what the broader data says.

Let's dive in.

# SKIN IN THE GAME

Robert Enlow, president of [EdChoice](https://www.edchoice.org/), has spent nearly 30 years watching what happens when families get more say in their kids' education.

His research shows something that applies whether you're homeschooling, using a private school, or working within a public system: when parents have real input, outcomes improve. Students perform slightly better on state tests, graduate at higher rates, and attend college more often. But Enlow points to something that doesn't make headlines as often: the social effects.

"When you have skin in the game, you make better decisions," he says. Families who feel ownership get more involved. They engage more with teachers. Their kids show greater tolerance for differing opinions.

This isn't an argument against public schools, or private schools, or any other kind of schools. It's an observation about human behavior. We've seen enrollment shifts across the country as families have grown accustomed to having choices in every other area of their lives. The schools that are thriving—public or private—are the ones that treat parents as partners, not obstacles. Give parents freedom and information, and they figure it out.

# DATA VS. HEADLINES

Brett Pike runs [@ClassicLearner](https://x.com/ClassicLearner) and translates education research into clear, parent-friendly arguments. He's one of the best follows on the homeschool side of the internet.

After yet another recent mainstream story implied that homeschooling leads kids to fall behind, [Pike responded](https://x.com/ClassicLearner/status/2013389673310081411) with the simplest corrective possible:

"Homeschool students outperform public school peers in science, math, history, English, the ACT, and the SAT."

He's citing data from [HSLDA's 2009 Progress Report](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED535134), a nationwide study of nearly 12,000 homeschooled students conducted by Dr. Brian D. Ray. That study found homeschoolers scoring 34-39 percentile points above national averages. More than 78% of peer-reviewed studies since have shown the same pattern, and the advantage holds regardless of family income or parental education level.

I mean, this isn't obscure research. It's been replicated for decades. So why doesn't the coverage match the data? (Rhetorical question. We all know why.)

# LANGUAGE WITHOUT THE WALL

Foreign language is where a lot of homeschool families hit a wall. It's hard to teach conversational Spanish when you maxed out at "Dónde está el baño."

[Preply](https://preply.com/) connects you with native speakers for live 1-on-1 lessons, with over 100,000 tutors teaching more than 90 languages. You can filter by accent, schedule, budget, and specialization, so your kid ends up practicing with someone from Madrid or Tokyo rather than memorizing verb conjugations from a textbook.

The results back it up: 92% of learners say their tutor keeps them motivated, and 88% report real improvement in speaking skills. The platform has a 4.8-star rating across more than 21,000 reviews. Trial lessons run 25 or 50 minutes, and rates vary by language—some start surprisingly low.

That's all for today!
