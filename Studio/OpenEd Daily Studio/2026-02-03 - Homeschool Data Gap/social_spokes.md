## LinkedIn Post 1: Hot Take

**Tags:** @ClassicLearner @EdChoice

Every few weeks, a major outlet publishes a story about a homeschooled kid who fell behind. The framing is always the same: without institutional oversight, children suffer.

Here's what they leave out.

Homeschooled students score 34-39 percentile points above national averages in reading, math, science, and history. More than 78% of peer-reviewed studies confirm this advantage. It holds regardless of family income or parental education level.

The data comes from Dr. Brian D. Ray's nationwide study of nearly 12,000 students - and it's been replicated for decades. This isn't fringe research. It's one of the most consistent findings in education.

Meanwhile, Robert Enlow at EdChoice has spent 30 years studying what happens when families get more choice. His finding: when parents have skin in the game, outcomes improve across the board. Test scores, graduation rates, college attendance - and something harder to measure: kids who grow up with greater tolerance for differing opinions.

The schools that are thriving right now, public or private, are the ones that treat parents as partners. The ones losing enrollment are the ones that treat parents as a problem to manage.

The question under the headlines is always the same: can parents be trusted? The data has answered that for years.

## LinkedIn Post 2: Story / Stat

**Format:** Data narrative
**Tags:** @ClassicLearner

Brett Pike (@ClassicLearner) does something useful on X: he translates education research into language parents can actually use.

After yet another headline implied that homeschooling leads to kids falling behind, Pike posted the simplest possible correction:

"Homeschool students outperform public school peers in science, math, history, English, the ACT, and the SAT."

He was citing a nationwide study of nearly 12,000 students that found homeschoolers scoring 34-39 percentile points above average. Since that study, more than 78% of peer-reviewed research has confirmed the pattern - and the advantage holds across income levels and parental education backgrounds.

So why does coverage still default to the anecdote-as-warning-label format?

Probably because "system works fine for most families who leave it" is a harder story to tell than "child falls through the cracks."

Headlines: "Homeschooled kid falls behind"

Data: Homeschoolers score 34-39 percentile points above national averages.

78% of peer-reviewed studies confirm this.

The coverage doesn't match the data. It hasn't for decades.

The question hiding under most homeschool coverage: can parents be trusted?

You might have seen another headline this week about a homeschooled kid who fell behind.

Here's what the actual data says:

Homeschoolers score 34-39 percentile points above national averages. In every subject. Across income levels. Replicated for decades.

78% of peer-reviewed studies confirm this.

So why doesn't the coverage match the data?

(Ed the Horse has some thoughts.)
