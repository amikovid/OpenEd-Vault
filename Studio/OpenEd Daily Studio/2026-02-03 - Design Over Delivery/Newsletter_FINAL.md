**SUBJECT:** Two courses, one platform, opposite outcomes

**PREVIEW:** Michael Horn took two Harvard courses online. One worked. One didn't. The difference wasn't the tech. PLUS: why handwriting might be the most important "tech skill" of 2026.

Greetings Eddies!

There's a question parents keep asking about online learning: "Is it good or bad?"

Wrong question.

Michael Horn took two online courses at Harvard. Same platform. Same student. Same year. One was brilliant - compelling storylines, short bursts of text, instructor engagement when he needed it. The other was a wall of dense paragraphs with no support. He could barely stay awake.

The variable wasn't "online." It was design.

# THE ORIGINAL THOUGHT PROBLEM

The real threat from AI isn't that it will write for our kids. It's that it will think for them - one autocomplete suggestion at a time.

Julie Bogart has been [teaching writing](https://blog.bravewriter.com/2026/01/30/importance-of-handwriting/) for decades, and she's noticed something: handwriting lights up more areas of the brain than typing or voice-to-text. This isn't nostalgia. It's neuroscience. The slow, deliberate act of forming letters anchors memory and creativity in ways keyboards can't replicate.

But here's the part that matters now: when every digital tool suggests, corrects, and predicts, writing by hand is the last place kids can think without algorithmic interference. No red squiggles. No "did you mean...?" No helpful AI offering to finish their sentence.

Bogart's suggestion sounds almost absurdly analog: wordless music, a candle, writing together as a family. It reads like a parody of homeschool cottage-core until you realize she's describing the exact opposite of everything modern life pushes on families. Quiet. Slow. Unpredictable.

The messiness of original thought requires space that autocomplete won't give you.

# DESIGN OVER DELIVERY

Back to Horn's [Harvard courses](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/foreword-to-virtual-schools-actual).

The good one used short video segments with clear storylines. Graphics that actually helped. Instructors who showed up when students got stuck. The bad one dumped paragraphs of text onto a screen and called it "online learning."

Same technology. Opposite outcomes. I mean, obviously.

"Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality," Horn writes in the foreword to *Virtual Schools, Actual Learning*. Digital formats CAN free students from constraints of time, location, and pace. But only when someone bothers to design them that way.

Parents keep asking the wrong question. "Should my kid do online school?" is like asking "Should my kid read books?" It depends entirely on which books. The delivery method is neutral. The pedagogy is the variable.

Ask instead: "Is this well-designed? Do the instructors actually engage? Or did someone just upload a textbook and call it innovation?"

# STOP BUYING INK CARTRIDGES

You're probably hemorrhaging money on printer ink right now. Most homeschool families are.

The math is brutal: that $50 inkjet printer costs $500 a year in cartridges. Meanwhile, an ink tank printer costs more upfront but pennies per page. Do the math over three years and the "expensive" printer saves you hundreds.

Three that actually work:

**Epson EcoTank ET-2850** (~$300) - The homeschool workhorse. Ink tanks last thousands of pages. Duplex printing. The bottles are cheap and last forever.

**HP Smart Tank 7001** (~$280) - Similar concept, slightly better for photos if you're printing curriculum covers or art projects.

**Brother HL-L2350DW** (~$150) - Laser, not inkjet. Black and white only, but if you're mostly printing worksheets, this thing is indestructible and the toner lasts approximately forever.

The rule: never buy cartridges again. Ink tanks or laser. Everything else is a trap.

That's all for today!

P.S. The most important tech skill for kids in 2026? Probably a pencil.
