# Newsletter Draft v2 - 2026-02-03 (Monday)

**SUBJECT:** Two courses, one platform, opposite outcomes
**PREVIEW:** Michael Horn took two Harvard courses online. One worked. One didn't. The difference wasn't the tech. PLUS: why handwriting might be the most important "tech skill" of 2026.

Greetings Eddies!

Michael Horn took two online courses at Harvard. One was brilliant. One was a disaster. Same platform, same student, same year. The difference? One professor actually designed the thing. The other just dumped a textbook into a learning management system and called it innovation.

I mean, obviously.

More on that below, plus a contrarian take on handwriting and a PSA about your printer (you're hemorrhaging money and you know it).

Let's dive in.

# THOUGHT: YOUR KID'S BRAIN ON AUTOCOMPLETE

Every time your kid types in Google Docs, they're being nudged. Autocomplete. Spell-check. That creepy gray text that finishes their sentences before they do.

Julie Bogart - founder of [Brave Writer](https://bravewriter.com/), one of the biggest homeschool writing programs out there - has been watching this for years. Her take: [handwriting is becoming a form of resistance](https://blog.bravewriter.com/2026/01/30/importance-of-handwriting/).

"Handwriting lights up more areas of the brain than typing or voice to text," she writes. "It anchors memory, focus, and creativity."

But here's the thing nobody wants to say out loud: the real threat isn't that AI will write for our kids. It's that AI will think for them - one autocomplete suggestion at a time. Handwriting is the last place where that doesn't happen. No suggestions. No corrections. Just your kid and the mess of their own thoughts.

Bogart's recommendation sounds almost aggressively analog: wordless music, a candle, writing together. Sounds like something your grandmother would do. Which is maybe the point.

# TREND: DESIGN OVER DELIVERY

Back to Horn. He [wrote a foreword](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/foreword-to-virtual-schools-actual) for a new book on virtual schools, and buried in there is a story that explains basically everything wrong with the "is online school good or bad?" discourse.

At Harvard, one online course used compelling storylines, graphics, short bursts of text. It worked. The other was dense walls of text with zero instructor support. It bombed.

"Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality," Horn writes.

Look: parents keep asking the wrong question. "Is virtual school good?" Wrong question. Online is a delivery method. That's it. The pedagogy is the variable. You can have a brilliantly designed online course or a terribly designed one, just like you can have a brilliant or terrible classroom teacher.

Next time you're evaluating an online option, don't ask "is this online?" Ask: "is this well-designed?" If the person selling it can't answer that question with specifics, run.

# TOOL: STOP BUYING CARTRIDGES

That $50 printer is costing you $500 a year in ink. You know this. You've been meaning to fix it. Here's your sign.

Ink tank printers cost more upfront but pennies per page. Cartridge printers: 8-15 cents per page. Ink tank: 1-2 cents. If you're printing worksheets, unit studies, and the occasional 47-page Minecraft guide your kid found online, you'll break even in months.

**Three that work:**

**Epson EcoTank ET-2850** (~$250) - The homeschool workhorse. 4,500 black pages per fill. No cartridges, ever.

**HP Smart Tank 7001** (~$230) - Similar deal, slightly cheaper. Good if you're already stuck in HP's ecosystem.

**Brother INKvestment MFC-J1205W** (~$180) - Budget pick. Uses high-yield cartridges (not true ink tanks) but still way cheaper per page than standard printers.

One rule: never buy a printer based on upfront cost. Calculate total cost of ownership. Then buy the ink tank. You're welcome.

That's all for today!

P.S. Horn's foreword is for *Virtual Schools, Actual Learning* from the Pioneer Institute. Worth a look if you're actually trying to evaluate online options instead of just vibing about them.
