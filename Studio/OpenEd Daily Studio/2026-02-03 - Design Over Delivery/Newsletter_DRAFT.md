**SUBJECT:** Two courses, one platform, opposite outcomes
**PREVIEW:** Michael Horn took two Harvard courses online. One worked. One didn't. The difference wasn't the tech. PLUS: why handwriting might be the most important "tech skill" of 2026.

Greetings Eddies!

Julie Bogart wants your kids to pick up a pencil. Not because she's a Luddite - she runs [Brave Writer](https://bravewriter.com/), one of the most popular homeschool writing programs in the country. She's watched thousands of kids learn to write. And she's noticed something.

The ones who handwrite think differently.

Not better or worse. Just... theirs. Original. Unassisted by the little gray suggestions that pop up every time you pause on a Google Doc.

Bogart's not anti-tech. But she is pro-thinking. And in 2026, those two things are starting to diverge in interesting ways.

More on that below, plus a counterintuitive take on virtual schools and a practical guide to not hemorrhaging money on printer ink.

Let's dive in.

# THOUGHT: THE LAST UNASSISTED SPACE

Here's something I hadn't considered until I read Julie Bogart's recent piece on [handwriting in the age of AI](https://blog.bravewriter.com/2026/01/30/importance-of-handwriting/).

Every time your kid types, they're being nudged. Autocomplete. Spell-check. Grammarly. Google's "helpful" gray text that finishes their sentences before they do. It's subtle, but it's constant. And over time, it shapes how they think - or whether they bother to think at all.

Handwriting is the last place where that doesn't happen.

"Handwriting lights up more areas of the brain than typing or voice to text," Bogart writes. "It anchors memory, focus, and creativity."

But here's what stuck with me: handwriting preserves the messiness of original thought. The crossed-out words. The arrows. The "wait, actually" moments that happen when you're not being autocorrected in real-time.

Bogart's suggestion is almost comically analog: wordless music, a candle, writing together with your kids. It sounds like something your grandmother would do. Which is maybe the point.

# TREND: DESIGN OVER DELIVERY

Michael Horn took two online courses at Harvard Business School. Same platform. Same student. Same year.

One was brilliant. One was terrible.

The successful course, Horn [writes in a recent foreword](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/foreword-to-virtual-schools-actual), used "compelling storylines and accompanying graphics" with "short bursts of text." The failed one dumped dense walls of text with zero instructor support.

The variable wasn't "online." It was design.

This matters because parents keep asking the wrong question. "Is virtual school good or bad?" Wrong question. Online is just a delivery method. The pedagogy is the variable.

Horn puts it simply: "Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality." Digital formats CAN free students from constraints of time, location, and pace. But only when someone takes the time to design them well.

Next time you're evaluating an online option - a virtual school, a hybrid program, an asynchronous course - don't ask "Is this online?" Ask: "Is this well-designed?" The answer will tell you everything.

# TOOL: STOP BUYING CARTRIDGES

That $50 printer is costing you $500 a year in ink. You know this. You've been meaning to do something about it. Here's your permission slip.

Ink tank printers cost more upfront ($200-350) but pennies per page. The math isn't close. A cartridge printer costs roughly 8-15 cents per page. An ink tank printer costs 1-2 cents. If you're printing worksheets, unit studies, and the occasional 47-page Minecraft guide your kid found online, you'll break even in months.

**Three that actually work:**

**Epson EcoTank ET-2850** (~$250) - The homeschool workhorse. Prints, scans, copies. Ink lasts roughly 4,500 black pages. No cartridges, ever.

**HP Smart Tank 7001** (~$230) - Slightly cheaper, similar specs. Good if you're already in the HP ecosystem and don't want to learn new software.

**Brother INKvestment MFC-J1205W** (~$180) - The budget pick. Uses high-yield cartridges (not true ink tanks) but still dramatically cheaper per page than standard printers. Good entry point if you're not ready to commit.

One rule: never buy a printer based on upfront cost. Calculate the total cost of ownership. Then buy the ink tank.

That's all for today!

P.S. If you want to go deeper on the virtual schools question, Horn's piece is a foreword to *Virtual Schools, Actual Learning* - a new book from the Pioneer Institute with case studies from Julie Young (founder of Florida Virtual School) and others. Worth a look if you're evaluating online options.
