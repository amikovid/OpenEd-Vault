**SUBJECT:** Two courses, one platform, opposite outcomes
**PREVIEW:** Michael Horn took two online courses at Harvard. One worked. One didn't. The difference wasn't the tech. PLUS: the printer math nobody does.

Greetings Eddies!

There's a question hiding under the "is online school good or bad?" debate:

**Does the delivery method actually matter?**

Michael Horn took two online courses at Harvard Business School. Same platform. Same year. One was brilliant. One was a disaster. The variable wasn't "online." It was whether anyone bothered to design the thing.

Let's dive in.

# DESIGN OVER DELIVERY

Horn [writes about this](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/foreword-to-virtual-schools-actual) in a new foreword for *Virtual Schools, Actual Learning*. The successful course used short bursts of text, compelling storylines, graphics. The failed one dumped walls of text with no instructor support.

"Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality," he writes.

Online can free students from constraints of time, location, and pace. But only if someone takes the time to design it well. Most don't. Hence the mixed results, and the endless discourse about whether "virtual school" is good or bad.

Next time you're evaluating an online option, skip the ideological debate. Ask: "Is this well-designed?" If the person selling it can't give you specifics, you have your answer.

# THE LAST UNASSISTED SPACE

Julie Bogart runs [Brave Writer](https://bravewriter.com/), one of the bigger homeschool writing programs. She's been [making the case for handwriting](https://blog.bravewriter.com/2026/01/30/importance-of-handwriting/) as a form of cognitive hygiene.

"Handwriting lights up more areas of the brain than typing or voice to text. It anchors memory, focus, and creativity."

Her point: every time your kid types in Google Docs, they're being nudged. Autocomplete. Spell-check. Gray text finishing their sentences. Handwriting is the one place where no algorithm is whispering suggestions.

I mean, think about it. When was the last time your kid wrote something without a single digital suggestion? Bogart's recommendation - wordless music, a candle, writing together - sounds almost aggressively analog. That's the point.

# THE PRINTER MATH

That $50 printer is costing you $500 a year in ink. You probably know this. Here's the math nobody does:

Cartridge printers: 8-15 cents per page.
Ink tank printers: 1-2 cents per page.

If you're printing worksheets, unit studies, and the occasional 47-page thing your kid found online, you break even in months.

**Three that work:**

**Epson EcoTank ET-2850** (~$250) - 4,500 pages per fill. The homeschool standard.

**HP Smart Tank 7001** (~$230) - Similar specs, slightly cheaper upfront.

**Brother INKvestment MFC-J1205W** (~$180) - High-yield cartridges, not true ink tanks, but still way cheaper per page than standard printers.

That's all for today!

P.S. Horn's foreword is part of a new book from the Pioneer Institute with case studies from Julie Young (founder of Florida Virtual School) and others. Worth a look if you're actually evaluating online options.
