# THOUGHT: THE LAST UNASSISTED SPACE

Every time your kid types in Google Docs, they get nudged. Autocomplete. Spell-check. Gray text finishing their sentences.

Julie Bogart runs [Brave Writer](https://bravewriter.com/), one of the bigger homeschool writing programs. She's been [arguing for handwriting](https://blog.bravewriter.com/2026/01/30/importance-of-handwriting/) as a kind of cognitive hygiene - the one place where no algorithm is whispering suggestions.

"Handwriting lights up more areas of the brain than typing or voice to text. It anchors memory, focus, and creativity."

Her recommendation: wordless music, a candle, writing together. Analog on purpose.

# TREND: SAME PLATFORM, OPPOSITE OUTCOMES

Michael Horn took two online courses at Harvard. Same platform. Same year. One worked, one didn't.

The successful course used short text, storylines, graphics. The other dumped walls of text with no instructor support.

"Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality," Horn [writes](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/foreword-to-virtual-schools-actual).

Online is a delivery method. The pedagogy is the variable. When evaluating virtual options, ask "is this well-designed?" not "is this online?"

# TOOL: INK TANK PRINTERS

That $50 printer costs $500/year in ink. Cartridge printers run 8-15 cents per page. Ink tanks run 1-2 cents.

**Epson EcoTank ET-2850** (~$250) - 4,500 pages per fill. The standard.

**HP Smart Tank 7001** (~$230) - Similar specs, slightly cheaper.

**Brother INKvestment MFC-J1205W** (~$180) - High-yield cartridges, not true ink tanks, but still dramatically cheaper per page.

Calculate total cost of ownership. Buy the ink tank.
