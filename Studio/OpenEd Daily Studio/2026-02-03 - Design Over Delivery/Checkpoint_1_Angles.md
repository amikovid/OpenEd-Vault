# Checkpoint 1: Angles & Structure - 2026-02-03

## SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS

### Curiosity-Based
1. What Harvard taught me about online learning
2. The skill AI can't replace (yet)
3. Two courses, one platform, opposite outcomes

### Specificity-Based
4. Why your printer choice actually matters
5. Handwriting: the original anti-AI tool
6. Michael Horn on what makes virtual school work

### Hybrid
7. A pencil, a printer, and a paradox
8. The design secret virtual schools miss
9. What if tech isn't the variable?
10. Your kid's brain on handwriting vs typing

**Recommended:** #3 "Two courses, one platform, opposite outcomes" - creates information gap, specific enough to intrigue

## PREVIEW TEXT

**Draft:** Michael Horn took two Harvard courses online. One worked. One didn't. The difference wasn't the tech. PLUS: why handwriting might be the most important "tech skill" of 2026.

## SEGMENT 1: THOUGHT - HANDWRITING AS REBELLION

**Source:** Julie Bogart, Brave Writer

### Angle Options

**A) The Anti-AI Angle**
Handwriting is becoming a form of resistance. When every digital tool suggests, corrects, and predicts, writing by hand is the last place kids can think without algorithmic interference.

**B) The Brain Science Angle**
"Handwriting lights up more areas of the brain than typing." This isn't nostalgia - it's neuroscience. The slow, deliberate act of forming letters anchors memory and creativity in ways typing can't match.

**C) The Ritual Angle**
Bogart's suggestion: wordless music, a candle, writing together. It sounds twee until you realize she's describing the opposite of everything modern life pushes on families.

**D) The "Original Thought" Angle**
The real threat isn't that AI will write for our kids. It's that AI will think for them - one autocomplete suggestion at a time. Handwriting is how you preserve the messiness of original thought.

**Recommended:** D - most contrarian, challenges the obvious AI narrative

## SEGMENT 2: TREND - DESIGN OVER DELIVERY

**Source:** Michael Horn, foreword to *Virtual Schools, Actual Learning*

### Angle Options

**A) The Harvard Story**
Horn took two online courses at Harvard. Same platform, same student, same year. One was brilliant - compelling storylines, short bursts of text. One was terrible - dense walls of text, no instructor support. The variable wasn't "online." It was design.

**B) The "Lockstep" Quote**
"Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality." Digital formats CAN free students from constraints of time, location, and pace. But only when someone designs them to.

**C) The "Technology is Neutral" Take**
Parents keep asking: "Is online school good or bad?" Wrong question. Online is just a delivery method. The pedagogy is the variable. Ask instead: "Is this well-designed?"

**D) The Instructor Support Angle**
Even in online environments, most learners benefit significantly from teacher and peer engagement. The fantasy of self-paced, self-directed digital learning works for some. For most, connection still matters.

**Recommended:** A (the Harvard story) - concrete, memorable, makes the abstract point tangible

## SEGMENT 3: TOOL - THE HOMESCHOOL PRINTER GUIDE

**Source:** Research needed - homeschool community recommendations

### Angle Options

**A) The "You're Printing Wrong" Angle**
Most homeschool families are hemorrhaging money on printer ink. The secret? Stop buying cartridges. Ink tank printers cost more upfront but pennies per page. Here are three that actually work.

**B) The Straightforward Recommendations**
You asked, we listened. Here are the three printers homeschool families actually recommend - and why.

**C) The "Total Cost of Ownership" Angle**
That $50 printer costs $500/year in ink. That $300 printer costs $30/year. Do the math. Here's what to buy.

**D) The Quick Hits Format**
Three printers. Three price points. One rule: never buy cartridges again.

**Recommended:** A or C - the "you're doing it wrong" hook is stronger than just listing products

## ORTHOGONALITY CHECK

- [x] THOUGHT (handwriting philosophy) and TREND (virtual school design) are distinct but related by a meta-theme: "it's not the technology, it's how you use it"
- [x] Aligns with OpenEd beliefs: pro-parent choice, practical over ideological
- [x] Would Sarah forward this? Yes - the handwriting angle is contrarian enough to share, the printer recs are immediately useful

## QUESTIONS FOR APPROVAL

1. **Subject line preference?** (I recommend #3)
2. **THOUGHT angle:** D (original thought) or another?
3. **TREND angle:** A (Harvard story) or C (technology is neutral)?
4. **TOOL angle:** Need to research actual printer recs - confirm top 3?
5. **Order:** THOUGHT → TREND → TOOL, or rearrange?

🛑 **CHECKPOINT - Please approve angles before I proceed to draft.**
