## Key Learnings (Skill Updates Made)

### 1. Pirate Wires Voice - What It Actually Is

The skill now has 3 inline examples showing the real voice:

**What works:**
- Complete flowing sentences (not fragments)
- Parentheticals are RARE and only for genuine punch
- Says what everyone thinks: "Of course, none of them read..."
- Confident, not snarky - states observations directly
- Casual interjections ("lol," "I mean,") used sparingly

**What doesn't work:**
- Fragments for punch: "Thousands of dollars. Five bucks a pop."
- Snarky parentheticals: "(Thank you, intrinsic motivation.)"
- Forced cheerfulness or setup-payoff crutches

### 2. Social-First Extraction

Added to Phase 1 of the skill - identify format fit BEFORE drafting newsletter:

| Snippet Type | Natural Format |
|--------------|----------------|
| Single stat + interpretation | X one-liner |
| Comparison/contrast | Instagram carousel |
| Transformation arc | LinkedIn story |
| Counterintuitive claim | X paradox |

**Principle:** If a snippet has an obvious social format, draft that version first. Social constraints produce tighter angles.

### 3. Framework Fitting Methodology

Not just summarizing - extracting CONCEPTS:

```
SOURCE → CONCEPT EXTRACTION → EMOTIONAL HOOK → TEMPLATE MATCH → DRAFT
```

Example from today's work:
- **Source:** Austin Scholar - Cognitive Load Theory
- **Concept:** Working memory has ~7 slots; when basics aren't automatic, they consume slots meant for learning
- **Emotional hook:** Relief - "it's not your kid's fault"
- **Template match:** Paradox hook (X)
- **Draft:** "Your child isn't bad at math. Their brain is doing two jobs at once..."

## Content Ready to Use

### Monday Newsletter (Ready)
- Subject: "Why The Minimalists pulled their daughter out of school"
- 4 segments: PAWS story, Scrolling data, BePresent app, Pleonexia word

### Social Posts (5 Ready)
1. Working Memory paradox (X) - @AustinScholar
2. Belonging Shift transformation (LinkedIn) - @michaelbhorn
3. Engagement Contrarian (X) - 74M data
4. 6-Hour Stat (X) - @michaelbhorn
5. Three Loads carousel (Instagram) - @AustinScholar

### Tuesday Newsletter (Planned)
- Theme: "How Learning Actually Works"
- THOUGHT: Homework problem is memory, not motivation
- TREND: All 8 Gallup engagement measures at all-time highs
- TOOL: 4 exercises that actually help

### Wednesday Newsletter (Planned)
- Theme: "Real-World Learning"
- THOUGHT: The osmosis problem (passive internships fail)
- TREND: 200 to 3,000 micro-internships in 3 years
- TOOL: 5 durable skills that transfer

## What Didn't Work

### Slack Delivery
- Plain text worked but stripped formatting
- Markdown formatting caused "invalid_blocks" error
- **Better approach:** Create Notion page, share link to Slack

### Thursday Newsletter
- User said to scrap it - too policy-heavy (Iowa loan bill)
- Save for future when there's a stronger education hook

---

## Proposed Next Directions

### Option A: Finish Tuesday Newsletter
Draft the "How Learning Actually Works" newsletter using the planned segments. Social posts are already framework-fitted in `Social_Posts_Framework_Fitted.md`.

### Option B: Create Notion Delivery System
Build a workflow where content packages get saved to Notion, then link shared to Slack. More reliable than direct Slack markdown.

### Option C: Schedule Social Posts
Use getlate.dev API to schedule the 5 framework-fitted posts across platforms (X, LinkedIn, Instagram).

### Option D: Update Skill with Session Learnings
The skill was updated inline, but we could:
- Add the handles collection pattern
- Add the Notion delivery workflow
- Refine the framework fitting examples
