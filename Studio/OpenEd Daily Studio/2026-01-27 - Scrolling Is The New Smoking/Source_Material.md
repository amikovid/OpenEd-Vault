## TREND: "Scrolling Is the New Smoking" TEDx Talk

**Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYK1u8Vg5No
**Speakers:** Joshua Fields Millburn, Ryan Nicodemus, TK Coleman (The Minimalists)
**Event:** TEDxFargo 2025

### Key Points

**The Health Data:**
- Frequent users (2+ hours/day) are 3x more likely to be diagnosed with depression
- 40% higher risk of sleep problems

**Core Argument:**
Social media has become "digital consumerism" - the ideology that more views, likes, followers will lead to happiness.

**The "Milked Cow" Effect:**
Modern social media is designed to "milk" the nervous system for emotional responses, rendering users energetically unable to nurture real-life relationships.

**Eye-Tracking Technology:**
Platforms use front-facing cameras and eye-tracking data to see exactly what you look at and for how long. The algorithm knows you better than you know yourself.

**The Experiment:**
The Minimalists took a full year off social media after reaching half a billion people - "but that was something we counted, right? That doesn't really measure anything because most of those are just eight-tenths of a second. Does that mean anything at all?"

**The Entryway Rule:**
Joshua's family puts phones at the door. "I can still use it like a home phone. I'm not deprived of the thing, but the distractions don't follow me around the house."

**Treating Scrolling Like Smoking:**
"Anytime they must respond to a message—at home, at the office, or at the local burrito joint—they simply say, 'Please excuse me while I step outside to take this message,' just like they would if they needed to take up smoking."

## THOUGHT: Joshua's Daughter Ella

**Source:** https://share.descript.com/view/Yyu4QESqzAu (clip from when Isaac was on The Minimalists podcast)
**Full story:** Thursday's OpenEd podcast episode with Joshua

### The Story

Joshua's daughter Ella went to kindergarten and first grade in Missoula, Montana - Spanish immersion, good public school. Yet she was miserable.

"She would come home with stomach aches. She'd have stomach aches in the morning with the anxiety of going and being forced to try to read."

Labels came: ADHD, dyslexia. They tried several things within the system. Nothing worked.

"What we're doing right now doesn't work. We've tried several things within the system and it still doesn't work. So we need to find a new path forward."

### The Resolution

Found an unschool in Southern California. Husband and wife bought an old school building and removed all the desks. "Effectively it's like going to a school place, but there is no school."

Joshua describes it as "Lord of the Flies, but with a couple adults on the island."

Recording studio. Band instruments. Art room. Bug room. Gardens. Kids ages 6-16 in the same space teaching each other. Ella (now 12) is making films just because she's interested.

"I find that the self-directed learning, she's able to delight herself in a way that she was never delighted by the public school system."

### The Dyslexia Discovery

Joshua didn't know he was dyslexic until age 40 - when Ella was struggling to read and he took the test with her.

"I'm like, well, yeah, reading is just really hard, right? And they're like, no."

He'd assumed everyone struggled with reading. Turns out he'd been dyslexic his whole life.

## TOOL: BePresent App

**Website:** https://www.bepresentapp.com/
**App Store:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bepresent-screen-time-control/id1644737181

### The Founders' Story

Jack and Charles Winston are Gen Z brothers from NYC. Jack worked at EY and DraftKings. Charles was a Googler. They built BePresent because they needed it themselves.

As older Gen Z, they were the first generation to grow up with smartphones. They watched themselves and friends try for years to solve phone addiction with conventional tools. Nothing worked. So they built their own.

### What Makes It Different

Most screen time apps feel like punishment. BePresent uses gamification - you can compete with friends, earn real-life rewards for staying present. Makes reducing screen time a game rather than a chore.

### Stats
- Raised $150K seed from Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator (2023)
- Profitable
- Their 2024 Digital Wellness Report: "Half of the population isn't getting enough sleep and more than a third are experiencing increased anxiety" from phone usage

### The Hook
Two Gen Z brothers who grew up with smartphones in their hands decided to build the antidote.

## Connecting Thread

Both stories (Isaac's daughter, Joshua's daughter) show kids who were miserable in traditional school finding their path outside it. The screen time angle connects because:
1. The Minimalists TEDx Talk is current/fresh content
2. Screens and school are both examples of "clutter" - things that get in the way
3. The entryway rule is a concrete actionable takeaway

**Pleonexia Quote (Joshua):**
"Ancient Greeks had a word for this: pleonexia - greed for things that can be counted. What are my accolades of things that can be counted? How many square feet of joy do you have in your life? How many yards of peace have I acquired this year?"

## Notable Quotes

**On Competition:**
"I think that type of competition is a mental illness... It's like I'm signing a contract with myself to be discontented until I get the thing that I want."

**On Joy:**
"Joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered. It's buried beneath the clutter."

**On Parenting:**
"My number one job as a parent is to not screw my daughter up."

**On Clutter:**
"Is our coffee grinder clutter? If I put it in your bed before you went to sleep, all of a sudden it would be clutter because it would get in your way."
