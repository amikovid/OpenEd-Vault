## Instagram Caption

When @joshuafieldsmillburn pulled his daughter out of public school in first grade, she was having anxiety attacks every day.

By age 10, she started her own dog walking business - PAWS: Pretty Awesome Walking Service.

Thousands of dollars walking dogs at $5 a pop.

"I feel like it's a job she would do for free anyway. She just gets to play with their dog for five hours and then they give her money."

No curriculum taught her customer service, scheduling, or reliability. She learned it because she wanted to.

Full conversation with Joshua drops Thursday.
