**Segments:**

## SOCIAL-FIRST EXTRACTION

Before drafting each newsletter, identify which snippets have natural social formats:

| Snippet Type | Natural Format | Draft First? |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Single stat + interpretation | X one-liner | Yes - tests the hook |
| Comparison (before/after, A vs B) | Instagram carousel | Yes - forces visual thinking |
| Transformation arc | LinkedIn story | Maybe - if the arc is strong |
| Counterintuitive claim | X paradox | Yes - sharpens the angle |
| Practical list | Instagram carousel or X thread | Yes - validates utility |

**The principle:** If a snippet has an obvious social format, draft that version first. Social constraints often produce tighter angles.

## PIECES THAT DIDN'T FIT THIS WEEK

Save for future:
- AI failure paradox (80% fail, yet $315B invested) - needs a strong education hook
- $315B AI vs $79B education budget - powerful but needs context
- Moral hazard in Iowa bill - too inside-baseball without more setup
- Reddit threads (socialization, curriculum reviews) - good for future TOOL segments

## THEMATIC COHERENCE

The week tells a story:
- **Monday:** The problem (screens, anxiety, what we're measuring wrong)
- **Tuesday:** The science (how learning actually works, what's going well)
- **Wednesday:** The solution (real-world learning, skills that transfer)
- **Thursday:** The system (accountability, why teachers leave, the podcast as capstone)

Each day can stand alone, but together they build toward: **kids learn when we stop getting in the way**.
