**SUBJECT:** A parrot, a man, and the point of algebra
**PREVIEW:** Remember that puzzle we teased last week? Adults are losing their minds over it. The answer is simple - if you actually understand what algebra is for. PLUS: The SpaceX school's secret for making math click.

Greetings Eddies!

Remember that logic puzzle I teased in last week's roundup? The one with the parrot on the man's head?

I promised to break it down. Then I forgot. (Apologies.)

Let's fix that.

## THE PARROT PUZZLE

A man stands with a parrot on his head. Total height: 200.

The man stands next to the parrot on the ground. The difference between them: 170.

How tall is the parrot?

This thing has been making the rounds on social media. The comments are a mess - wrong answers, arguments, adults admitting they have no idea where to start.

The answer is 15. (Man is 185, parrot is 15. Add them: 200. Subtract: 170. Done.)

But here's the thing: **this is just two equations with two unknowns.** Algebra 1. Millions of people spent years doing problems exactly like this.

So why does a cartoon parrot break their brains?

## SOLVE FOR X-WING

Isaac Morehouse, one of OpenEd's co-founders, [wrote about this years ago](https://opened.co/blog/i-played-with-legos-instead-of-doing-math). He was homeschooled. His mom assigned Saxon Math. He stared out the window instead.

What he actually did with his time: played with LEGO. Constantly. Between ages 4 and 13, roughly half of every day.

His mom felt guilty about it. Isaac did too. He worried "real school kids" would be ahead of him. That day never came.

Here's his insight:

> "Algebra is about figuring out puzzles when you don't have all the pieces. But most kids don't really know this and don't really care. I didn't. But I did love solving complex problems without having all the pieces... as long as those pieces were small bits of colored plastic."

None of us had enough LEGO to build exactly what we imagined. You want a lightsaber? You've got to break some pieces in half and improvise. You want an X-Wing? You're solving for X the whole time - you just don't know it's called algebra.

Isaac again:

> "I loved solving for X, as long as it was the X-Wing spacecraft."

The procedure stuck for the kids who did worksheets. The understanding didn't. That's why a parrot stumps them.

## WHY SYNTHESIS WORKS

Ana Lorena Fabrega, Chief Evangelist at [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/), put it bluntly:

> "So many kids hate math, and can you blame them? Math in school has nothing to do with reasoning."

Synthesis came out of the school Elon Musk built for SpaceX employees' kids. When that school shut down, two teachers spun out its problem-solving curriculum into what's now Synthesis - team challenges where kids aged 8-14 collaborate on complex simulations. No grades. No "right answers." Just pure reasoning.

There's also [Synthesis Tutor](https://www.synthesis.com/tutor), built with mathematician Dr. James Tanton. Unlike rote practice apps, it walks kids through *why* math works using interactive puzzles and visuals. It doesn't just give answers - it builds understanding.

The distinction matters. Most math apps drill procedures. Synthesis builds the pattern recognition that lets you look at a parrot puzzle and think: "Oh, I know this shape. Two unknowns. Two constraints. I can solve this."

Kids who build things - with LEGO, with simulations, with real problems - learn to recognize the shape of a puzzle. They don't need to remember the steps because they understand what's actually happening.

The parrot puzzle isn't exposing a math crisis. It's exposing a *teaching* crisis.

We taught procedures. We should have taught pattern recognition.

That's all for today!

P.S. If you solved the parrot puzzle in under 10 seconds, congrats - you actually learned algebra. If you didn't, maybe your kid's LEGO obsession is more educational than you thought.
