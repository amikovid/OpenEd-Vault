Greetings Eddies!

Quick question: when you picture homeschooling, what do you see?

Barefoot kids at the kitchen table? Mom juggling a toddler and a worksheet? General chaos?

Today's story is the opposite of that. It's a household that runs tighter than most schools I've visited.

Let's dive in.

## THE 7-TO-7 SCHOOLHOUSE

Business Insider recently profiled [Tamela Gill Davis](https://www.businessinsider.com/im-married-to-nfl-player-heres-why-homeschool-our-kids-2025-12), wife of New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis. She has six kids, ages 1 to 12. She homeschools all of them.

Her setup: **school runs 7am to 7pm. The kids wear uniforms Monday through Thursday.** She hired a second teacher - the two of them swap between older and younger kids throughout the day.

Why uniforms? "It's a way of teaching professional development," she says. "It's very important to show up in the world in a way that reflects who you are."

Before meeting her husband, Tamela was planning a career in education - teacher, principal, superintendent. That training now runs her home. She didn't stumble into homeschooling. She engineered it.

Even during football season, the family has dinner together four nights a week. The message to the kids is constant: **"We're the team."**

The freedom to homeschool isn't about escaping structure. It's about choosing the *right* structure.

## THE 250K QUESTION

New York state [lost a quarter-million K-12 students](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/k-12-enrollment-falls-aging-nys-charter-schools-gain) over the past decade. Almost 90% of districts shrank. New York City alone dropped 187,000 from traditional public schools - a 19% decline.

Cornell demographers have an explanation: "An aging population, people having fewer children, and at later ages."

Okay. Sure. Fewer kids means fewer students. The math checks out.

But here's what the demographics don't explain: **Charter enrollment more than doubled.** Homeschooling doubled. Private school ticked up.

If this were purely about birth rates, you'd expect all categories to shrink proportionally. They didn't. The pie got smaller, but the slices changed shape.

Families aren't just having fewer kids. They're making different choices about where those kids learn. And once they make those choices, they're not going back.

The demographers aren't wrong. They're just not telling the whole story.

## STRUCTURE AS A GAME

If your kid resists structure, [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) might be the workaround.

It's a free app that turns tasks and routines into an RPG. Complete your math lesson? Earn gold. Finish your chores? Level up your character. Skip your responsibilities? Your avatar takes damage.

**Why it works for resistant kids:**
- Novelty - ADHD brains crave it, and Habitica delivers daily
- Visible progress - XP bars and achievements make effort tangible
- Social accountability - you can join parties where everyone's progress affects the group

The app was originally designed for adults struggling with productivity, but homeschool families have discovered it's perfect for kids who need external motivation baked into the system.

It won't replace parenting. But it might replace nagging.

**Cost:** Free (premium features available but not necessary)
