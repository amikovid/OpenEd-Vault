## PREVIEW TEXT OPTIONS

A. "We wrote about John Taylor Gatto months ago and forgot about it. Then the traffic started climbing. Here's why."

B. "NYC's Teacher of the Year quit in the Wall Street Journal. His critique of 'the hidden curriculum' is more relevant than ever."

C. "Every few months, stories about homeschool kids 'falling behind' make headlines. Nobody asks: behind whom?"

## OPENING LETTER ANGLES

### Angle A: "We didn't expect this" (RECOMMENDED)
Lead with the traffic surprise. Honest, behind-the-scenes, makes the reader feel like an insider. Pivots to "why now" via the homeschool headlines. Most natural for a deep dive CTA.

### Angle B: "The comparison trap"
Lead with the mainstream homeschool-kids-falling-behind headlines. Contrarian from the first sentence. Risk: starts negative, might feel like a rant before the reader knows what the article is about.

### Angle C: "The prophet nobody listened to"
Lead with Gatto as a figure - the guy who called it 30 years ago. More biographical, positions the deep dive as a profile worth reading. Risk: if the reader doesn't know Gatto, the hook is weaker.
