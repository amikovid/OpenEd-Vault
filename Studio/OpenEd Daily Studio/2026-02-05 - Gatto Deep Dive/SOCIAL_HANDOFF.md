### POST 1 - Infographic Feature
**Use:** infographic-7lessons.jpg

In 1991, John Taylor Gatto was named New York State Teacher of the Year.

Months later, he quit in the Wall Street Journal.

His crime? He outlined what schools actually teach:

1. Confusion - disconnected knowledge without context
2. Class position - know your place in the hierarchy
3. Indifference - no work is worth finishing
4. Emotional dependency - seek external validation
5. Intellectual dependency - wait to be told what to think
6. Provisional self-esteem - your worth depends on performance
7. Constant surveillance - you cannot hide

30 years later, these lessons are harder to unsee.

### POST 2 - Quote + Contrarian (Nearbound)
**Tag:** @EdRevolution (they host his resignation letter)

"Schooling is a form of adoption. You give your kid away at his most plastic years to a group of strangers."

That's not from a homeschool influencer.

It's from the three-time NYC Teacher of the Year.

John Taylor Gatto spent 30 years in public schools before quitting at the peak of his career. Not quietly - with a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled "I Quit, I Think."

His critique of the "hidden curriculum" predicted what we're watching unfold now.

Organizations like @EdRevolution have kept his work alive. The open education movement is his legacy in action.

### POST 3 - Nearbound + Ken Danford Connection
**Tag:** @LiberatedLearn, Ken Danford (LinkedIn)

The best teacher in New York quit because he couldn't stop hurting kids.

Not physically. Institutionally.

John Taylor Gatto won Teacher of the Year three times. Then he walked away and spent the rest of his life explaining why schools produce confusion, dependency, and indifference by design.

His influence runs deep. Ken Danford at @LiberatedLearn built North Star after reading Gatto - a network of self-directed learning centers that let teens opt out of school entirely.

Gatto's seven lessons are a mirror most educators don't want to look into.

We wrote a deep dive on why his work matters more than ever: [link]

### POST 4 - Peter Gray / ASDE Connection
**Tag:** @SelfDirectedEd, @PeterGray_Play

Every few months, a new wave of stories hits about homeschool kids "falling behind."

But falling behind what, exactly?

John Taylor Gatto asked that question 30 years ago - and he was the most decorated teacher in New York City when he asked it.

His answer: The seven lessons schools actually teach have nothing to do with academics.

Researchers like @PeterGray_Play and organizations like @SelfDirectedEd have built on this foundation. The evidence keeps mounting: self-directed learners thrive.

The open education movement is Gatto's legacy in action.

His reason? "I can't teach this way any longer. If you hear of a job where I don't have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know."

Here's what he saw 👇
