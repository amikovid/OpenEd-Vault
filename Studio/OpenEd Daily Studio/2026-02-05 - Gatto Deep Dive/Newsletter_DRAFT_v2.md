**PREVIEW:** We wrote about John Taylor Gatto months ago and forgot about it. Then the traffic started climbing.

Greetings Eddies!

Last year, we published a short piece on John Taylor Gatto - the three-time NYC Teacher of the Year who quit in the Wall Street Journal. Honestly, we didn't think much of it. Gatto died in 2018. His biggest books came out in the '90s. Not exactly trending material.

Then the article started quietly climbing. Steady traffic, week after week. So we went back in, rewrote it, and gave it the depth it deserved. Turns out a lot of people are searching for John Taylor Gatto right now - and I have a theory about why.

Every few months, a new wave of stories hits about homeschool kids "falling behind." The framing is always the same: compare homeschoolers to the system and find them lacking. But nobody stops to ask whether the system they're being compared to is actually working. Gatto asked that question 30 years ago. It took the rest of us a while to catch up.

Here's what we found when we revisited his story.

When American schoolteacher John Taylor Gatto penned an op-ed in *The Wall Street Journal* announcing he didn't want to "hurt kids to make a living," it alarmed parents everywhere. But Gatto wasn't having a breakdown. He was pulling back the curtain on what he called the "hidden curriculum" - the things schools actually teach when nobody's paying attention.

This wasn't a disgruntled employee. Gatto had just been named New York State Teacher of the Year in 1991 - his third consecutive city-level award. He quit at the absolute peak of his career.

"Schooling is a form of adoption," he later said. "You give your kid away at his most plastic years to a group of strangers."

Before teaching, Gatto drove a cab through New York City, wrote advertising copy on Madison Avenue, designed jewelry, and even ghostwrote speeches for Richard Nixon. This wasn't aimless wandering. Each job taught him how the real world actually worked - the world schools supposedly prepared children for. He watched how successful people operated, noticed what skills actually mattered, and saw that credentials often mattered far less than curiosity and adaptability.

When he finally entered teaching, he was anything but conventional. He sent students on independent research projects at public libraries. He arranged for shy 13-year-olds to interview legislators at the state capitol. He connected "at-risk" students with real apprenticeships.

These methods earned him major recognition. They also led him to a conclusion he couldn't ignore: **compulsory schooling had little to do with academics and everything to do with diminishing children's natural curiosity and potential.**

In his State Teacher of the Year acceptance speech, Gatto stunned the audience by outlining what he called "The Seven-Lesson Schoolteacher" - seven unintended lessons he believed every institutional school inevitably teaches. Confusion. Class position. Indifference. Emotional dependency. Intellectual dependency. Provisional self-esteem. Constant surveillance.

He wasn't guessing. He'd spent nearly 30 years watching it happen from inside the system.

The longer you sit with Gatto's seven lessons, the harder they are to unsee. The bell that teaches kids no work is worth finishing. The grading system that ties self-worth to performance. The raised hand that trains children to wait for permission before thinking. These aren't abstract critiques. They're the everyday architecture of school - so familiar we stopped noticing.
