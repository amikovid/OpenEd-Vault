Greetings Eddies!

Last year, we published a short piece on John Taylor Gatto - the three-time NYC Teacher of the Year who quit in the Wall Street Journal. Honestly, we didn't think much of it. Gatto died in 2018. His biggest books came out in the '90s. Not exactly trending material.

Then the article started quietly climbing. Steady traffic, week after week. So we went back in, rewrote it, and gave it the depth it deserved. Turns out a lot of people are Googling John Taylor Gatto right now - and I have a theory about why.

Every few months, a new wave of stories hits about homeschool kids "falling behind" or "getting left behind." The framing is always the same: compare homeschoolers to the system and find them lacking. But nobody stops to ask whether the system they're being compared to is actually working. Gatto asked that question 30 years ago. It took the rest of us a while to catch up.

# THOUGHT: THE PROPHET NOBODY LISTENED TO

In 1991, John Taylor Gatto used his New York State Teacher of the Year acceptance speech to tell the audience that schools teach seven unintended lessons - confusion, class position, indifference, emotional dependency, intellectual dependency, provisional self-esteem, and constant surveillance. The room went quiet. He wasn't guessing. He'd spent [nearly 30 years in New York City public schools](URL) watching it happen.

What's striking isn't that Gatto said it. It's that everything he described has only gotten more visible. The dependency on external validation, the inability to sit with ambiguity, the loss of curiosity - these aren't hypothetical anymore. They're the main complaints parents bring to us every single week.

# TREND: THE COMPARISON TRAP

Here's what the "homeschool kids are falling behind" stories never mention: behind whom? A recent Harvard study found that [40% of U.S. fourth graders can't read at a basic level](URL). Chronic absenteeism in public schools hit 26% nationally in the 2022-23 school year - roughly double the pre-pandemic rate. Youth mental health outcomes have been in free fall for a decade.

None of this means homeschooling is automatically better. But when mainstream outlets frame it as homeschoolers vs. "normal" school, they're comparing one imperfect approach to another imperfect approach and calling the second one the baseline. Gatto's whole point was that the baseline is broken. You can't measure an alternative against a standard that isn't delivering on its own promises.

# TOOL: GATTO'S BOOKSHELF

If the deep dive hooks you, here's where to go next. Gatto left behind three essential books, and one of them is free.

**Dumbing Us Down** (1992) is the starting point - a short collection of essays that gave homeschool families language for what they already felt. **The Underground History of American Education** (2001) is the deep cut - a sprawling investigation into how American schooling got designed the way it is. Gatto made the [full text available for free](https://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/) on his website. **Weapons of Mass Instruction** (2008) takes on credentialism and the way schooling became hostile to actual learning.

Start with Dumbing Us Down. Read Underground History when you're ready to get angry.
