## THE ANYWHERE CLASSROOM

Melissa Barryman spent years as an assistant principal before pulling her kids to homeschool. Now her family drives to Texas for the solar eclipse and does hands-on learning in D.C. - the curriculum follows them. "I love that learning can take place anywhere," she told [WUSF](https://www.wusf.org/education/2025-12-06/homeschooling-on-the-rise-across-florida-families-seeking-flexibility).

The Thygerson family takes this further. They split their time between trekking in Nepal and building robots at the [Thanksgiving Point Makerspace](https://thanksgivingpoint.org/education/youth/) in Utah. "Learning is everywhere," one of the Thygerson kids explained in an OpenEd video. "It's not just in school for seven hours - it's every day and everywhere that you go."

No permission slips. No 6am buses. No docent reading from a script while thirty kids try not to touch anything. Just going somewhere and learning while you're at it.

## THE TRAVEL CURRICULUM

[72% of Florida homeschool parents](https://www.wusf.org/education/2025-12-06/homeschooling-on-the-rise-across-florida-families-seeking-flexibility) cite "desire to emphasize family life" as their reason for leaving traditional schools - and travel is a big part of how they use that flexibility. The Moffatt family, six kids deep, built their homeschool around it: "We wanted me to have more influence over the children than a whole bunch of teachers we didn't know."

[Maecy Palkki](https://opened.co/blog/is-homeschooling-the-wrong-word-were-only-home-3-hours-a-day-maecy-palkki) calls herself an "adventure schooler." Her family of five spends maybe three hours at home doing bookwork. The rest is out - friends, skiing, kayaking, whatever the day calls for. The traditional school calendar was designed for an agricultural economy that ended a century ago. Maecy's designing for a different one.

## WORLD-CLASS FIELD TRIPS

[NatureEye](https://natureeye.io) runs virtual tours of CERN's particle accelerator and live Q&As with Antarctic researchers - not the watered-down documentary version, but actual scientists answering your kid's questions in real time. Behind-the-scenes access tourists don't get. Curriculum-aligned content for homeschool integration. $10-20 per experience, and some ESA programs cover it.

[Charlynn Chambers](https://opened.co/blog/episode-016-how-to-transform-everyday-moments-into-powerful-learning-experiences-with-charlynn-chambers) finds learning everywhere - pancake fractions, farmer's market economics, Star Wars division problems. Virtual field trips are the same idea at scale. The physicist at CERN doesn't care that you're in Kansas.

That's all for today!
