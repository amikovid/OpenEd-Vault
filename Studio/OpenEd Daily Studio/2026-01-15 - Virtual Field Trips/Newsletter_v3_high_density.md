# OpenEd Daily — January 15, 2026 (v3: High-Density Test)

**SUBJECT:** Tour a particle accelerator before lunch
**PREVIEW:** "I love that learning can take place anywhere." One Florida mom took that literally. But what if you can't travel? Virtual tours of CERN and Antarctica might be the answer.

Greetings Eddies!

One of homeschooling's best features is also its most underused: the world is your classroom - the whole world, literally, not just the parts you can drive to.

## THE ANYWHERE CLASSROOM

Melissa Barryman, a former assistant principal turned homeschool mom, told a Florida reporter that she loves how "learning can take place anywhere" - and she meant it literally, traveling to Texas for the solar eclipse and doing hands-on learning in D.C. while the curriculum follows her family instead of the other way around. This is one of homeschooling's genuine superpowers: no permission slips, no 6am bus departures, no herding 30 kids through a museum, just going somewhere and learning while you're at it. But "anywhere" doesn't have to mean expensive travel - it can mean your kitchen table with the right tools, because the walls of a classroom are artificial and learning happens wherever curiosity meets opportunity, whether that's the Grand Canyon or a virtual tour led by a scientist who actually works there. As one family put it in our piece on [worldschooling without the plane ticket](https://opened.co/blog/worldschooling-without-the-plane-ticket): "Learning is everywhere - it's not just in school for seven hours. It's every day and everywhere that you go."

## THE TRAVEL CURRICULUM

The families leaving traditional schools often cite flexibility as the reason, and travel is a big part of how they use it - [72% of Florida homeschool parents](https://www.wusf.org/education/2025-12-06/homeschooling-on-the-rise-across-florida-families-seeking-flexibility) cite "desire to emphasize family life," with many reporting that field trips have become multi-day learning experiences instead of rushed one-day outings. The Moffatt family, with six kids, built their homeschool around this flexibility because they "wanted me to have more of an influence over the children than a whole bunch of variety of other teachers that we didn't know" - and that influence includes deciding when and where learning happens. [Maecy Palkki](https://opened.co/blog/is-homeschooling-the-wrong-word-were-only-home-3-hours-a-day-maecy-palkki), a mom of five who appeared on the OpenEd podcast, calls herself an "adventure schooler" whose family spends maybe three hours at home doing bookwork while everything else is out - friends, field trips, skiing, kayaking. The traditional school calendar was designed for an agricultural economy that no longer exists, and homeschool families are designing something different: education that fits around life, not life that fits around school.

## WORLD-CLASS FIELD TRIPS

[NatureEye](https://natureeye.io) brings the world's most inaccessible places to your screen - virtual tours of CERN's particle accelerator, live interactions with Antarctic researchers, behind-the-scenes access to places tourists can't go, all with curriculum-aligned content for homeschool integration. The cost is modest (typically $10-20 per experience, and some ESA programs cover it), and it turns "field trip" from a yearly event into a weekly possibility where your kids meet real scientists instead of just reading about them. [Charlynn Chambers](https://opened.co/blog/episode-016-how-to-transform-everyday-moments-into-powerful-learning-experiences-with-charlynn-chambers), another OpenEd parent, talks about finding learning opportunities everywhere from pancake-making to farmer's markets - virtual field trips are the same idea scaled up, and the physicist at CERN doesn't care that you're in Kansas.

## COMPARISON NOTES

**What changed from v2:**

1. **Opening:** Consolidated from 3 lines to 1 sentence. Eliminated "Let's dive in."

2. **THOUGHT section:** Was 10+ short paragraphs/fragments. Now 1 flowing paragraph. Same information, higher density.

3. **TREND section:** Was fragmented with bullet points and short paragraphs. Now 1 paragraph with data woven in.

4. **TOOL section:** Was bullet-point heavy. Now 1 paragraph with features woven into prose.

**Eliminated:**
- "Let's dive in" (setup phrase)
- "What most people miss:" (setup phrase)
- Bullet point lists (replaced with flowing prose)
- Multiple line breaks within sections
- "The whole world. Literally." (staccato for emphasis)

**Kept:**
- All the same information and links
- The sign-off structure
- Natural paragraph breaks between sections

**Word count:** ~550 words (vs ~650 in v2) - higher density, same substance
