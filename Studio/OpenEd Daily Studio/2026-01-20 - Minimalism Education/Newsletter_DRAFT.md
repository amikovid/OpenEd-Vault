Greetings Eddies!

We just dropped a new conversation with Joshua Fields Millburn of The Minimalists.

Joshua's 12-year-old daughter is dyslexic and thriving in an unschool environment. The conversation covers how they got there - and why minimalism applies to way more than physical stuff.

Let's dive in.

## THE APOPHATIC APPROACH

*By Isaac Morehouse*

Joshua Fields Millburn's book title says it all: "Love People, Use Things."

That's what we tell parents at OpenEd. Love kids, use education. School, curricula, pedagogical approaches - these are tools. They're not the thing doing the driving. Your kid is.

I call it the apophatic approach to parenting. Rather than asking "what is good parenting?" or "what is a good education?" - flip it around. What is NOT bad? How do I not screw this up?

I tell young people the same thing about careers: don't do stuff you hate. You don't know what you love yet. But hate is not the same as hard. Watch kids working on a Lego set or trying to beat a level in a video game. It's hard, but they're having a blast.

As long as you don't do stuff that sucks your soul and keep moving forward, you'll keep adding to the list of things you hate until you end up somewhere you love.

The ancient Greeks had a word for what we're avoiding: **pleonexia** - greed for things that can be counted. Grades, test scores, credits, accolades. All measurable. None measuring what matters.

## NO SHOULDS, ONLY COULDS

"There are no shoulds, there are only coulds."

Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus?

No. There are no shoulds with respect to education. Only coulds. She can do any of those things. The question is: is she compelled by any of them?

Joshua's daughter went from stomach aches every morning to thriving. The shift came when they stopped asking what she should learn and started asking what compelled her.

"Joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered. It's buried beneath the clutter."

## THE ENTRYWAY RULE

Joshua and his wife keep their phones at the door. They call it the entryway rule.

They can still use them like a home phone - if someone calls, they walk over and answer. But the distractions don't follow them around the house.

"I'm not deprived of the thing. But the distractions don't follow me around."

The bedroom? "The worst place for a phone."

## SCROLLING IS THE NEW SMOKING

The Minimalists took a year off social media. Had their most successful year ever.

Their TEDx talk makes the case that social media has become digital consumerism - the belief that more views, likes, and followers will lead to happiness. Same trap, different stuff.

"Look around the next time you're in line at Chipotle, Whole Foods, or Exxon: our addictions are showing. A generation ago, nearly everyone casually puffed cigarettes throughout the day."

### (WORD) OF THE DAY

## Pleonexia

**Pleonexia** [plee-oh-NEK-see-uh], *noun* (Greek): Greed for things that can be counted.

Grades, test scores, credits, accolades - all things that can be counted but don't measure growth. Or joy.

That's all for today!
