Greetings Eddies!

As promised on Monday - Joshua Fields Millburn's full story is here.

Joshua has helped millions of people declutter their lives. As co-founder of [The Minimalists](https://www.theminimalists.com/), he's spent years teaching that clutter is anything that gets in the way of a meaningful life.

Turns out that applies to education too.

When his daughter started having stomach aches every morning before school, Joshua realized the system that had been merely uncomfortable for him was making her miserable.

Here's what they did about it.

# When "Reading Is Just Hard" Turns Out to Be Something Else

**Joshua Fields Millburn on dyslexia, unschooling, and removing the desks**

Ella was in kindergarten and first grade - athletic, easygoing, and social. But every morning before school, she had stomach aches. Every afternoon, she came home with more of them.

She was attending a Spanish immersion public school in Missoula, Montana - by most measures, a good school with great offerings. But something was wrong. Whenever she was told to sit down and focus, to try to read, to participate in ways that were harder for her than other kids, it fell apart.

Her father recognized the struggle. Joshua Fields Millburn - co-founder of [The Minimalists](https://www.theminimalists.com/), Emmy-nominated filmmaker, and *New York Times* bestselling author of [*Love People, Use Things*](https://www.theminimalists.com/lput/) - had spent decades helping millions of people declutter their lives. But watching his daughter, he saw something familiar: his own childhood.

Labels started getting thrown around for Ella: ADHD. Dyslexia. They tried several approaches within the system. Working with the school. Different strategies. None of it worked.

Then came the dyslexia tests. Ella took them. And Joshua - now about 40 years old - took them alongside her.

"I didn't realize until I had a daughter that I was dyslexic. I mean, she was struggling to read. I'm like, well, yeah, reading is just really hard, right? And they're like, no."
