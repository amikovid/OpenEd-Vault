# Social Spokes: Project-Based Learning (Jan 28)

## LINKEDIN POST 1 (Hot Take)

**Format:** Contrarian opinion

Traditional education teaches the scientific method like this: memorize the steps, study formulas, complete textbook problems, and maybe - eventually - do something real.

Connor Boyack calls this the "just in case" model. Just in case you become a rocket scientist, memorize the quadratic equation now. Just in case you become a marine biologist, know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

But here's how actual learning works (his example, not mine): "When your refrigerator breaks down, at no point do you say, 'I'm so glad that eleven years ago I read the instruction manual cover to cover just in case.' Of course not. Just in time for when you need to fix it, you're pulling up YouTube, calling Uncle Bob who's super handy."

Project-based learning runs on this "just in time" model. A kid building a go-kart will encounter gear ratios, torque, and friction - not because someone assigned Chapter 7, but because the thing won't move without understanding them.

We published a full practical guide this week - real examples, a 7-step framework, and project ideas by age group. Link in comments.

## LINKEDIN POST 2 (Story/Stat)

**Format:** Transformation story

A 25-second experiment destroyed a kid's love of science. A treehouse brought it back.

Jack Casdorph remembers the day his class made a homemade compass - magnetized a needle, floated it on a packing peanut, watched it swing north. The kind of thing that should spark wonder.

Then the teacher handed out worksheets. For 30 minutes, students copied what they were "supposed to have learned." Jack says his interest in science was totally destroyed that day.

Years later, his father refused to build him a treehouse. But he offered something better: "I can help YOU build a treehouse."

What followed took months. Climbing lessons first (he had to become "monkey enough" to work at height). Then drilling practice on the back deck. Design planning. Measurements. And finally, construction.

By the end, Jack understood carpentry, basic engineering, planning, and persistence. None of it appeared on a worksheet.

He's now a mechanical engineer who advocates for project-based learning. The treehouse still stands.

We just published a full guide on how to bring this approach home. Link in comments.

## X POST 1 (Standalone)

"The experiment took 25 seconds. The writeup took 30 minutes. And that's when my interest in science was totally destroyed."

Jack Casdorph on why he became a project-based learning advocate.

His dad refused to build him a treehouse. Offered to help him build one instead. It changed everything.

Connor Boyack (@cboyack) calls traditional education the "just in case" model.

Just in case you become a rocket scientist, memorize the quadratic equation.

Just in case you become a marine biologist, know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

There's a better way. [1/]

- 2/ "When your refrigerator breaks down, at no point do you say, 'I'm so glad eleven years ago I read the manual cover to cover just in case.' You pull up YouTube. You call Uncle Bob." - @cboyack
- 3/ Project-based learning flips the model. Start with something real. A go-kart. A treehouse. A dog walking business. Let the theory follow.
- 4/ Jack Casdorph's class once spent 25 seconds on a compass experiment and 30 minutes on the worksheet about it. His interest in science died that day.
- 5/ Years later, his dad refused to build him a treehouse - but offered to help him build one. Months of climbing, drilling, measuring, constructing. The treehouse still stands.
- 6/ We published a full practical guide - the research, real examples, a 7-step framework, and project ideas by age. Link: opened.co/blog/project-based-learning

## INSTAGRAM CAPTION (Carousel)

**Visual suggestion:** Carousel format. Slide 1: "What if we've been teaching science backwards?" Slide 2: The spectrum graphic (Abstract to Applied). Slide 3: The compass story. Slide 4: The treehouse story. Slide 5: "Just in case" vs "Just in time" comparison. Slide 6: CTA to full guide.

A 25-second experiment destroyed a kid's love of science.

Jack Casdorph's class magnetized a needle, floated it in water, and watched it swing north. A homemade compass. The kind of thing that should make you go "whoa."

Then the teacher handed out worksheets. Thirty minutes of copying what they were supposed to have learned.

Years later, his dad refused to build him a treehouse. Instead he said: "I can help YOU build one."

Months of climbing, drilling, measuring, and building later - Jack understood engineering, planning, and persistence. None of it was on a worksheet.

He's now a mechanical engineer and project-based learning advocate. The treehouse still stands.

We just published a full practical guide to project-based learning at home - the research, real examples, and a step-by-step framework. Link in bio.
