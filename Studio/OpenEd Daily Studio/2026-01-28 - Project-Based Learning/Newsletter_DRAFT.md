Greetings Eddies!

We just published a new deep dive on project-based learning - what it actually looks like, why it works, and how to start at home.

Here's the opening. Full guide linked at the bottom.

# PROJECT-BASED LEARNING: A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR HOMESCHOOL FAMILIES

"The experiment took 25 seconds. The writeup took 30 minutes. And that's when my interest in science was totally destroyed."

Jack Casdorph remembers the day clearly. His class magnetized a needle, floated it on a foam packing peanut in a bowl of water, and watched it swing north. They were making a homemade compass - the kind of thing that should spark wonder.

Instead, the teacher handed out worksheets. For the next half hour, students copied - verbatim - what they were supposed to have learned. "Even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed," Jack recalls, "my interest in science at that time was totally destroyed."

Jack went on to become a mechanical engineer and educator who now advocates for project-based learning - the approach that saved his own curiosity years later, when his father refused to build him a treehouse and offered to help him build one instead.

## What Is Project-Based Learning?

Project-based learning is education through extended, real-world projects where children direct their own learning toward meaningful outcomes.

The key word is *meaningful*. A worksheet about fractions isn't project-based learning. Neither is a diorama assigned by a teacher with a rubric. Project-based learning starts with something the child actually wants to create, solve, or understand - and lets the learning emerge from that pursuit.

Jack Casdorph describes traditional education as spending too much time on the wrong side of a spectrum:

```
ABSTRACT ←――――――――――――――――――――→ APPLIED
Math → Science → Engineering → Technology/Making
```

"The stuff on the right isn't even touched in most education," he explains on the [OpenEd podcast](https://opened.co/blog/have-we-been-teaching-stem-completely-backwards-the-case-for-project-based-learning). Traditional schools start with theory and hope students eventually connect it to reality. Project-based learning flips this: start with reality, and theory follows naturally.

A child building a go-kart will encounter gear ratios, torque, and friction - not because someone assigned Chapter 7, but because the go-kart won't move without understanding them.

## Why Traditional Education Has It Backwards

Consider two approaches to teaching the scientific method:

**Traditional (Theory-First):**

1. Memorize the steps: hypothesis, experiment, observation, conclusion.
2. Study abstract formulas and concepts.
3. Complete problems from a textbook.
4. Maybe, eventually, do something real.

**Practice-First:**

1. Start with an engaging project - a treehouse, a bridge, a chicken coop.
2. Encounter genuine problems that need solving.
3. Develop skills as the project demands them.
4. Discover principles through direct experience.

[Connor Boyack](https://opened.co/blog/5-questions-with-tuttle-twins-creator-connor-boyack), creator of the Tuttle Twins book series, calls traditional education the "just in case" model. Just in case you become a rocket scientist, memorize the quadratic equation now. Just in case you become a marine biologist, know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

The problem? That's not how humans actually learn.

"When your refrigerator breaks down," Boyack points out, "at no point do you say, 'I'm so glad that eleven years ago I read the instruction manual cover to cover just in case.' Of course not. Just in time for when you need to fix it, you're pulling up YouTube, calling Uncle Bob who's super handy."

Project-based learning operates on this "just in time" model. Children don't stockpile knowledge for hypothetical futures. They acquire skills when those skills become necessary to accomplish something they care about.

When Jack's father refused to build him a treehouse, he didn't just say no. He said: "I can help YOU build a treehouse."

What followed took months. First, Jack needed to become "monkey enough" at climbing trees to work safely at height. Then came drilling lessons on the back deck. Then design planning with measurements. Then, finally, construction.

By the end, Jack understood carpentry, basic engineering, planning, and persistence - none of which appeared on a worksheet. The treehouse still stands.
