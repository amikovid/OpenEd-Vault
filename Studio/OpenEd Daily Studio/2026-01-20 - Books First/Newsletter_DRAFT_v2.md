Greetings Eddies!

Had a conversation this week with someone who has 2,000 books in her house and makes her living on her phone. She's figured out something about screens that most parents miss.

Let's dive in.

## BOOKS FIRST

"Screens will always win the dopamine battle."

That's Janssen Bradshaw - runs [Everyday Reading](https://everyday-reading.com/), has four daughters who love books, and spends her workday on Instagram and her phone. She told us on the [Open Ed Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@OpenEducation) that she's never tried to compete with screens.

She just got there first.

"From the time my first child was born, I wanted books and reading first - have that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens."

The rule in her house: "We turn the TV on when we're actually gonna watch something. Almost always as a family - not a lot of solo watching."

No app blockers. No elaborate system. Books came first. By the time screens showed up, the habit was already there.

## THE QUIET EXIT

Remember when everyone predicted homeschooling was a pandemic blip?

[Johns Hopkins](https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/homeschool-growth-2024-2025/) just released their 2024-2025 numbers. Homeschooling is growing at **5.4% annually** - nearly 3x the pre-pandemic rate. Eight states hit all-time high enrollment this year.

Angela Watson, the researcher who's tracked this for a decade: "This isn't a pandemic hangover; it's a fundamental shift in how American families are thinking about education."

No protests. No policy fights. Just millions of families quietly making a different choice.

The interesting question: what did they discover during COVID that made them refuse to go back?

## TOOL: SAVVY LEARNING

Janssen's second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade. Drifting further down every assessment.

Janssen tried working with her. The kid screamed. Cried. Refused.

During COVID, an intern from the school offered to tutor her online. 20 minutes a day. White screen, black words. Nothing fancy.

The daughter got on with no complaint. Swam in the pool, came inside, did her session, went back out. No resistance.

Within weeks: major progress. By fifth grade, she was reading at an 11th grade level.

That program became [Savvy Learning](https://www.savvylearning.co/) - live 1-on-1 tutoring for reading and math. 20-25 minute sessions, 4x/week. It meets kids exactly at their level. Available in the [OpenEd Marketplace](https://openedmarketplace.com/).

Sometimes a different voice is what the kid needs.

That's all for today!
