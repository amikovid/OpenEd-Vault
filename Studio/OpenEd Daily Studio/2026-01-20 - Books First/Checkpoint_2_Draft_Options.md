### Opening Hook Options

**Option A: The Surprise Reveal**
> Janssen Bradshaw has 2,000 books in her house. She runs one of the internet's most beloved book recommendation sites, and has four daughters who choose books over screens. 
>
> And yet, she'll tell you she's not anti-screen. (After all, she makes her living on her phone.)

**Option B: The Obvious Truth**
> Here's something everyone knows but nobody wants to say: you're not going to win the dopamine battle. Screens are designed by the smartest engineers in the world to capture attention. Your kid's picture book doesn't stand a chance.
>
> Unless you stop trying to compete.

**Option C: The "You're the Adult" Move**
> Parents keep asking how to get kids to choose books over screens. The answer isn't complicated. You're the adult. Make a decision.
>
> Janssen Bradshaw made hers before her first kid was born.

**Option D: Start with the Quote**
> "Screens will always win the dopamine battle."
>
> That's Janssen Bradshaw - 2,000 books in her house, four daughters who love reading, and she's not anti-screen at all. She makes her living on her phone.

---

### Core Argument Options

**Option A: The Sequencing Frame** GOOD
> Her approach isn't about limiting. It's about sequencing. Books came first. That's it.
>
> "From the time my first child was born, I wanted books and reading first - and have that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens."
>
> By the time screens entered the picture, the habit was already there.

**Option B: The Concrete Behavior**
> The actual rule in her house: "We turn the TV on when we're actually gonna watch something. Almost always as a family - not a lot of solo watching."
>
> That's it. No elaborate system. No app blockers. Just: books first, screens together.

**Option C: The Permission Frame**
> She's not judging you for handing your kid an iPad. She did too. The difference is what came first.
>
> You can't outcompete dopamine. But you can get there before the competition shows up.

---

### Closing Options

**Option A: The Takeaway**
> Books don't compete with screens. They come before them.

**Option B: The Link**
> Full conversation on the [Open Ed Podcast](#). Worth 45 minutes if you're building a reading culture at home.

**Option C: Both**
> Books don't compete with screens. They come before them.
>
> [Full conversation here](#) if you want the details.

## SEGMENT 2: TREND - Johns Hopkins Data

### Title Options

- [ ] THE QUIET EXIT
- [ ] WHAT THEY FOUND
- [ ] THE PREDICTION FAILURE
- [ X] 3X
- [ ] THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK
- [ ] _______________

---

### Opening Hook Options

**Option A: The Failed Prediction**
> Remember when everyone said homeschooling was a pandemic blip? That families would "return to normal" once schools reopened?
>
> [Johns Hopkins](https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/homeschool-growth-2024-2025/) just released their 2024-2025 data. Homeschooling is growing at 5.4% annually - nearly 3x the pre-pandemic rate.

> Here's the interesting question: not "why did homeschooling grow during COVID" - we know that. The question is why didn't families go back?


**Option B: The Question**

**Option C: The Observation**
> No protests. No policy fights. Just millions of families quietly making a different choice. Eight states hit all-time high enrollment this year.

---

### Core Argument Options

**Option A: The Discovery Frame**
> Something happened in those living rooms during 2020. Families discovered flexibility. Personalization. Reading together on the couch instead of rushing to the bus stop.
>
> They found what works. They're not giving it up.

**Option B: The Data + Researcher Quote**
> Angela Watson, the Johns Hopkins researcher who's studied this for a decade: "This isn't a pandemic hangover; it's a fundamental shift in how American families are thinking about education."
>
> Eight states at all-time highs. New Hampshire and Vermont rebounded 14.5% and 17% after a dip.

**Option C: The Institutional Blindness**
> Institutions keep waiting for families to come back. They're not coming back. They found something better and the institutions still don't get why.

---

### Closing Options

**Option A: Connect to THOUGHT**
> Maybe they discovered what Janssen figured out years ago - that the best stuff happens at home, on the couch, with a book.

**Option B: Just the Stat**
> 3x the pre-pandemic growth rate. The "return to normal" isn't happening.

**Option C: The Observation**
> The experts predicted wrong. Again.

## SEGMENT 3: TOOL - Savvy Learning

### Title Options

- [ ] SAVVY LEARNING
- [ ] GET OUT OF THE WAY
- [ ] THE 20-MINUTE FIX
- [ ] TOOL: SAVVY LEARNING
- [X ] THE NOT-MOM EFFECT
- [ ] _______________

### Opening Hook Options

**Option A: The Story**
> Janssen's second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade. Drifting further down every assessment.
>
> Janssen tried working with her. The kid screamed. Cried. Refused.

**Option B: The Permission Lead**
> Sometimes your kid doesn't want to work with you. That's not a failure.

**Option C: The Transformation**
> Barely at grade level in first grade. Reading at 11th grade level by fifth grade. Here's what changed.

---

### Core Argument Options

**Option A: The Full Story**
> During COVID, an intern from the school offered to tutor her online. 20 minutes a day. White screen, black words. Nothing fancy.
>
> The daughter got on with no complaint. Swam in the pool, came inside, did the session. No resistance.
>
> Within weeks: major progress. That program became [Savvy Learning](https://www.savvylearning.co/).

**Option B: The Mechanism**
> [Savvy Learning](https://www.savvylearning.co/) does live 1-on-1 reading and math. 20-25 minute sessions, 4x/week. The key: it meets kids exactly at their level. Not too easy (boring), not too hard (frustrating).
>
> Sometimes a different voice is what the kid needs.

**Option C: The Permission + CTA**
> It's not a failure to outsource. Sometimes the best thing you can do is bring in someone else.
>
> [Savvy Learning](https://www.savvylearning.co/) is in the OpenEd Marketplace - live tutoring for reading and math. Worth a look if you have a struggling reader, or one who's ahead and needs more challenge.

---

### Closing Options

**Option A: The Result**
> Janssen's daughter went from barely grade level to 11th grade reading in four years. The secret wasn't more worksheets. It was meeting her exactly where she was - with someone who wasn't mom.

**Option B: The Link**
> Available in the [OpenEd Marketplace](#). Free assessment to start.

**Option C: Quick Pitch**
> 20 minutes. 4 days a week. Right level. Different voice. That's it.
