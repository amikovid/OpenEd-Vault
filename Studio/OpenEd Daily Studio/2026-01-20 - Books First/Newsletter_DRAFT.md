Greetings Eddies!

Here's a question that keeps parents up at night: How do you get kids to love books when screens are right there?

The usual advice is to limit screen time. Fight the battle. Hold the line.

But what if there's a different approach - one that doesn't involve fighting at all?

Let's dive in.

## BOOKS FIRST

Janssen Bradshaw has over 2,000 books in her house. She runs [Everyday Reading](https://everyday-reading.com/), one of the internet's most beloved book recommendation sites. She has four daughters who actually choose books over screens.

And she's not anti-screen.

"I love screens," she told us on the [Open Ed Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@OpenEducation). "My whole living is made online, basically on my phone."

Her approach isn't about limiting. It's about sequencing.

"Screens will always win the dopamine battle," she said. "From the time my first child was born, I wanted books and reading first - and have that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens."

The concrete behavior: "We turn the TV on when we're actually gonna watch something. Almost always as a family - not a lot of solo watching."

Books don't compete with screens. They come before them.

## THE STAYING POWER

Remember when everyone predicted homeschooling would shrink after the pandemic?

Johns Hopkins says otherwise. Homeschooling is now at **twice pre-pandemic levels** nationally. The "return to normal" never happened.

The interesting question isn't why homeschooling grew during COVID. We know that. The question is: why didn't families go back?

Something happened in those living rooms. Families discovered flexibility. Personalization. Reading together on the couch instead of rushing to the bus stop.

They found what works. And they're not giving it up.

## TOOL: READ ALOUD REVIVAL

If you're looking to build a reading culture in your home, [Sarah Mackenzie](https://readaloudrevival.com/) has been thinking about this longer than almost anyone.

Her podcast, [Read-Aloud Revival](https://readaloudrevival.com/podcast/), has been downloaded over **16 million times** in 167 countries. She's a homeschooling mom of six and author of *The Read-Aloud Family*.

Her core message: reading aloud isn't just for toddlers. Keep doing it with your 8-year-old. Your 12-year-old. Even your teenager.

"Education is about relationships, not checklists," she says. The books you share become the memories you keep.

The podcast is free. Start with [Episode 1](https://readaloudrevival.com/1/) - a conversation with Andrew Pudewa about why reading aloud to kids who can already read themselves is critically important.

That's all for today!

P.S. Speaking of reading: Janssen Bradshaw's second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade. She started working with a live tutor online - 20 minutes a day, 4 days a week, meeting her exactly where she was. By fifth grade, she was reading at an 11th grade level. That program is called [Savvy Learning](https://www.savvylearning.co/), and it's available in the OpenEd Marketplace for reading and math. Worth a look if you have a struggling reader - or one who's ahead and needs more challenge.
