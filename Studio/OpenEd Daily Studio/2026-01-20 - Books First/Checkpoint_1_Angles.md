## PREVIEW TEXT OPTIONS

**Option A:** "Janssen Bradshaw has 2,000+ books at home. She's not anti-screen - she makes her living on her phone. But she made one decision before her first child was born. PLUS: A tool that meets struggling readers exactly where they are."

**Option B:** "Screens will always win the dopamine battle. Unless you do this first. A book blogger's counterintuitive approach to raising readers. PLUS: Johns Hopkins says homeschooling doubled."

**Option C:** "Don't compete with screens. Sequence them. One mom's approach to building readers - not by limiting iPads, but by what she did first."

## SEGMENT 1: THOUGHT

**Source:** Open Ed Podcast - Janssen Bradshaw (Everyday Reading)

**Title Options:**
- BOOKS FIRST
- THE SEQUENCING TRICK
- DON'T COMPETE. SEQUENCE.

### Angle Options

**Angle 1: The Nuanced Position**
Lead with the surprise: she's not anti-screen. She makes her living on her phone. The insight is sequencing, not limiting. "Books don't compete with screens. They come before them."

*OpenEd Take:* This is permission-giving. Parents feel guilty about screens. Janssen isn't saying screens are bad - she's saying get the foundation first. Validation + practical strategy.

**Angle 2: The Dopamine Framing**
Lead with the problem: screens have a dopamine advantage books can never match. Don't try to fight biology - sequence around it. Build the reading habit before screens enter the picture.

*OpenEd Take:* Acknowledges the real challenge parents face. Doesn't moralize. Just observes: here's how dopamine works, here's how one family navigated it.

**Angle 3: The Concrete Behavior**
Skip the philosophy. Lead with what she actually does: "We watch as a family, not solo." 2,000 books in the house. Audiobooks constantly. The behavior is the lesson.

*OpenEd Take:* Show don't tell. Give readers something they can copy tonight. Less philosophy, more "here's exactly what this looks like."

**Recommended:** Angle 1 (The Nuanced Position) - Most contrarian, challenges the "screens are evil" narrative while still delivering practical value.

## SEGMENT 2: TREND

### Option A: Johns Hopkins Doubling (Recommended)

**Source:** Johns Hopkins study via Bangor Daily News

**Title Options:**
- THE DOUBLING THAT DIDN'T REVERSE
- TWICE THE NUMBERS
- THE NEW NORMAL

**The Data:** Homeschooling is now at TWICE pre-pandemic levels nationally. People assumed families would return to traditional school. They didn't.

### Angle Options

**Angle 1: The Expectation vs Reality**
Everyone predicted homeschooling was a pandemic blip. Johns Hopkins shows it doubled and stayed there. The "return to normal" never happened.

*OpenEd Take:* This isn't a trend piece about growth. It's about prediction failure. Experts were wrong. Parents voted with their feet.

**Angle 2: The Quiet Revolution**
No protests. No policy fights. Just millions of families making a different choice. The doubling happened without anyone noticing.

*OpenEd Take:* Contrasts with loud education debates. The real change is happening in living rooms, not legislatures.

**Angle 3: The Staying Power**
The question isn't "why did homeschooling grow?" - we know that. The question is "why didn't it reverse?" What did families discover that made them stay?

*OpenEd Take:* Connects to the THOUGHT - families found something that works. Reading culture, flexibility, personalization. They're not going back.

**Recommended:** Angle 3 (The Staying Power) - Creates natural bridge to THOUGHT (families found what works) without being repetitive.

### Option B: Maine 6.4% (Alternative)

**Source:** Bangor Daily News

**The Data:** Maine went from 3.6% to 6.4% homeschooled. 50+ districts now have 1 in 10+ students homeschooling.

*OpenEd Take:* Local story with national implications. When 1 in 10 families in your district makes a different choice, it's not fringe anymore.

---

### Option C: Florida Hybrid (Alternative)

**Source:** Step Up for Students - Florida PEP

**The Story:** Joshua Jones's family uses "the great compromise" - his 8th grader takes one ag class at district school for social time + sports, homeschools the rest.

*OpenEd Take:* The binary is dissolving. It's not homeschool OR public school. Families are mixing and matching.

---

## SEGMENT 3: TOOL

### Option A: Savvy Learning (Recommended)

**Source:** OpenEd Marketplace / Podcast

**Title Options:**
- TOOL: SAVVY LEARNING
- SAVVY LEARNING
- THE READING BREAKTHROUGH

**The Tool:** Live 1-on-1 reading and math instruction. 20-25 minute sessions, 4x/week. Meets kids exactly at their level - not too easy (boring), not too hard (frustrating).

**Key Detail:** Janssen's second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade, drifting further down. Started working with a tutor online during COVID. Within weeks, major progress. Now reads at 11th grade level in 5th grade.

### Angle Options

**Angle 1: The Transformation Story**
Her daughter went from barely grade level to 11th grade reading level. The secret wasn't more worksheets - it was meeting her exactly where she was.

*OpenEd Take:* Personalization isn't a buzzword. It's the difference between a kid who hates reading and one who devours books.

**Angle 2: The Consistency Angle**
It's not the platform. It's 20 minutes, 4 days a week, at exactly the right level. Savvy provides the structure parents struggle to maintain.

*OpenEd Take:* Homeschool parents know consistency is hard. Savvy outsources the hard part while you focus on everything else.

**Angle 3: The "Not Mom" Effect**
Janssen's daughter resisted working with her parents. Got on with the 22-year-old tutor with no complaints. Sometimes kids need a different voice.

*OpenEd Take:* Permission for parents: it's not a failure to outsource. Sometimes the best thing you can do is get out of the way.

**Recommended:** Angle 3 (The "Not Mom" Effect) - Most relatable, addresses a real pain point, and the story is compelling.

---

### Option B: Read Aloud Revival (Alternative)

**Source:** Tool Database

**The Tool:** Sarah Mackenzie's podcast and community focused on reading aloud to kids at any age.

*OpenEd Take:* Reading aloud isn't just for toddlers. The philosophy pairs naturally with Janssen's "books first" approach.

---

### Option C: 1000 Hours Outside (Alternative)

**Source:** Tool Database

**The Tool:** Ginny Yurich's movement/philosophy encouraging 1000 hours of outdoor time per year.

*OpenEd Take:* If books come before screens, what else comes before screens? Nature. Same sequencing principle, different domain.
