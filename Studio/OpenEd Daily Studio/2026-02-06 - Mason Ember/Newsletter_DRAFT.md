Greetings Eddies!

Most of what we share about open education and homeschooling is written by parents, teachers, researchers, and policy people. Fair enough - they know things. But today we get to hear from someone who's actually living it right now.

Mason Ember is 16. He's been homeschooled his entire life and has spent the past year filming a feature-length documentary called *Against the Grade*, following four teenagers with radically different approaches to education. When the New York Times published "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right" during that process, he wrote a response and got it published in their letters section.

We constantly ask parents and experts what children need. We rarely ask the kids. Here's the opening of our conversation.

# A 16-Year-Old Filmmaker Spent a Year Documenting Homeschoolers. Here's What He Found.

*By Ela Richmond*

Ten teenagers sit in a New York apartment reading *Madame Bovary*. No parents. No teachers. No one telling them to stay on task. One of them organized the whole thing - the books, the food, the museum trips they take together afterward. Sometimes she makes enough dinner for everyone. Sometimes people go home hungry. She figures it out.

The person who showed me this scene is 16 years old.

Mason Ember is a filmmaker, a lifelong homeschooler, and the creator of a documentary called [*Against the Grade*](https://www.againstthegrade.com/), which follows four teenagers with radically different approaches to education. He's not reflecting on childhood from adulthood. He's living it right now - filming his subjects while simultaneously building his own education in real time. When the New York Times published a guest essay titled "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right," Mason [wrote a response](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/letters/home-schooling-debate.html) that got published in their letters section. His message was simple: anybody can mess up education when they stop paying attention to what individual kids actually need.

## The Preschool Dropout

Mason went to preschool briefly at the Blue School in Manhattan - founded by a member of the Blue Man Group, arts-focused, and as progressive as it gets. It should have been a perfect fit for a curious, creative kid. It lasted two months.

The way he tells it: he was at an art easel, finger painting, totally absorbed. A teacher told him it was time for group sing-along. He argued with her. He wanted to stay with the painting. He was maybe four years old.

His parents pulled him out and tried homeschooling. Not as a permanent ideology - as an experiment. Year by year, they checked in. Is he learning what he needs? Is this still working? Every year, the answer was yes.

What followed was a childhood that looks incoherent from the outside and makes total sense from the inside. Mason wanted to be a stage magician. Then a chef. Then a comedian. Then a pilot. Then a filmmaker. His parents let him chase each one. His mom told him later: "I didn't really want you to become a stage magician." But she let him explore it for a year anyway.

His parents did something subtle, though. They didn't see "film" as his through-line. They saw *storytelling*. Whether he was making cooking shows in the basement at eight, writing jokes for a comedy show he produced, or creating a feature-length documentary at sixteen, the skill beneath the skill stayed consistent. So even today, when they talk about his future, they don't talk about film. They talk about stories.

The part of our conversation that surprised me most came later - when Mason shared two honest criticisms of homeschooling that even its biggest advocates need to hear.

## TTT Assessment

**Recommendation: Stick with the deep-dive teaser format.** This episode is a profile/interview - like the Joshua Millburn edition, it works best as an opening letter that sets the scene and drops you into the narrative. The TTT format (Thought-Trend-Tool) works better when there's a standalone idea, a news hook, and a product recommendation. Mason's episode is the story itself.

If you wanted to extract a TTT later (separate edition), the strongest angle would be:
- **Thought:** "Be pro-kid, not pro-system" - the education debate is framed wrong
- **Trend:** Kids are entering the education conversation (Mason's NYT letter, the documentary, teen-run book clubs)
- **Tool:** AERO (Alternative Education Resource Organization) annual conference that Mason recommended

But that's a separate edition, not this one.
