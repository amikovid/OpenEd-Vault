<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">Most of what we share about open education and homeschooling is written by parents, teachers, researchers, and policy people. Fair enough - they know things. But today we get to hear from someone who's actually living it right now.</p>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">Mason Ember is 16. He's been homeschooled his entire life and has spent the past year filming a feature-length documentary called <em>Against the Grade</em>, following four teenagers with radically different approaches to education. When the New York Times published &ldquo;The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right&rdquo; during that process, he wrote a response and got it published in their letters section.</p>

We rarely ask the kids. Here's the opening of our conversation.</p>

Here's What He Found.</h1>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">Ten teenagers sit in a New York apartment reading <em>Madame Bovary</em>. No parents. No teachers. No one telling them to stay on task. One of them organized the whole thing - the books, the food, the museum trips they take together afterward. Sometimes she makes enough dinner for everyone. Sometimes people go home hungry. She figures it out.</p>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">The person who showed me this scene is 16 years old.</p>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">Mason Ember is a filmmaker, a lifelong homeschooler, and the creator of a documentary called <a href="https://www.againstthegrade.com/" style="color: #03a4ea !important; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18px; font-family: inherit; line-height: inherit;"><em>Against the Grade</em></a>, which follows four teenagers with radically different approaches to education. He's not reflecting on childhood from adulthood. He's living it right now - filming his subjects while simultaneously building his own education in real time. When the New York Times published a guest essay titled &ldquo;The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right,&rdquo; Mason <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/letters/home-schooling-debate.html" style="color: #03a4ea !important; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18px; font-family: inherit; line-height: inherit;">wrote a response</a> that got published in their letters section. His message was simple: anybody can mess up education when they stop paying attention to what individual kids actually need.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 700; font-size: 24px; margin: 32px 0 16px 0; color: #333333; line-height: 1.3;">The Preschool Dropout</h2>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">Mason went to preschool briefly at the Blue School in Manhattan - founded by a member of the Blue Man Group, arts-focused, and as progressive as it gets. It should have been a perfect fit for a curious, creative kid. It lasted two months.</p>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">The way he tells it: he was at an art easel, finger painting, totally absorbed. A teacher told him it was time for group sing-along. He argued with her. He wanted to stay with the painting. He was maybe four years old.</p>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">His parents pulled him out and tried homeschooling. Not as a permanent ideology - as an experiment. Year by year, they checked in. Is he learning what he needs? Is this still working? Every year, the answer was yes.</p>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">What followed was a childhood that looks incoherent from the outside and makes total sense from the inside. Mason wanted to be a stage magician. Then a chef. Then a comedian. Then a pilot. Then a filmmaker. His parents let him chase each one. His mom told him later: &ldquo;I didn't really want you to become a stage magician.&rdquo; But she let him explore it for a year anyway.</p>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">His parents did something subtle, though. They didn't see &ldquo;film&rdquo; as his through-line. They saw <em>storytelling</em>. Whether he was making cooking shows in the basement at eight, writing jokes for a comedy show he produced, or creating a feature-length documentary at sixteen, the skill beneath the skill stayed consistent. So even today, when they talk about his future, they don't talk about film. They talk about stories.</p>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.65; margin: 0 0 20px 0; color: #333333;">The part of our conversation that surprised me most came later - when Mason shared two honest criticisms of homeschooling that even its biggest advocates need to hear.</p>
