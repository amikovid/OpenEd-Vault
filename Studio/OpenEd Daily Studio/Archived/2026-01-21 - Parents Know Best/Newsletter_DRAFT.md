**SUBJECT:** Outperform in science, math, history, English, ACT, SAT. So why the negative press?

**PREVIEW:** You might have seen another article this week about a kid who was homeschooled and fell behind. Here's what the data actually says. PLUS: language tutors who meet your family where you are.

Greetings Eddies!

You might have noticed another article making the rounds this week - the kind with a headline about a homeschooled kid who fell behind, or struggled, or didn't get the education they deserved.

These pieces show up regularly. They follow a pattern. And they almost never mention the data.

Let's dive in.

## THE COVERAGE GAP

Brett Pike, who runs [Classical Learner](https://www.instagram.com/classicallearner/) and has over 500,000 followers on Instagram, put it plainly:

Homeschool students outperform public school peers in science, math, history, English, the ACT, and the SAT.

Yet whenever mainstream publications write about homeschooling, they almost always frame it as a problem. A risk. Something that needs oversight.

The data from the Home School Legal Defense Association shows homeschoolers scoring 15-30 percentile points higher than public school students on standardized tests. More than 78% of peer-reviewed studies show the same pattern. The advantage holds regardless of family income or parental education level.

So why does the coverage never match the data?

Pike's answer is a question: "Now, why do you think that is?"

## SKIN IN THE GAME

Robert Enlow runs [EdChoice](https://www.edchoice.org/) and has spent nearly 30 years in education policy. He's watched what happens when families actually get to make choices about their kids' education.

The results are consistent: students in choice programs perform slightly better on state tests, graduate at higher rates, and go to college more often. But Enlow points to something less obvious - the social effects that don't make headlines.

"When you have skin in the game, you make better decisions," he says. Families who choose get more involved with their kid's school. They engage more with teachers. Their kids show greater tolerance for differing opinions.

And here's the part that surprises people: researcher Patrick Wolf found that parents become better and better at choosing over time. Give them the freedom and information, and they figure it out.

The 1925 Supreme Court case Pierce v. Society of Sisters already settled this: "The child is not the mere creature of the state." Parents are the first educators. The data just keeps proving it.

## TOOL: PREPLY

If there's one subject where homeschool parents feel least confident, it's foreign languages. Hard to teach conversational Spanish when you don't speak it yourself.

[Preply](https://preply.com/) connects you with native speakers for live 1-on-1 lessons. They have 100,000 tutors teaching 90+ languages - you can filter by accent, schedule, budget, and specialization. Your kid can practice with someone from Madrid or Tokyo, not a textbook.

The numbers are solid: 92% of learners say their tutor motivates them to keep improving. 88% feel they've actually improved their speaking skills. Platform rating is 4.8 out of 5 from over 21,000 reviews.

Trial lessons run 25 or 50 minutes. Rates start low for some languages. Worth checking out if languages are the gap in your homeschool plan.

That's all for today!
