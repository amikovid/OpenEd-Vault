Now, onto today's issue. I had a conversation this week with someone who has 2,000 books in her house and makes her living on her phone. She's figured out something about screens that I think a lot of parents miss.

Let's dive in.

## BOOKS FIRST

"Screens will always win the dopamine battle."

That's Janssen Bradshaw. She runs [Everyday Reading](https://everyday-reading.com/), one of the internet's most popular book recommendation sites, and she has four daughters who genuinely prefer books to screens. She also spends most of her workday on Instagram and her phone - it's how she makes a living.

When we talked on the [Open Ed Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@OpenEducation), she explained that she's never really tried to compete with screens. She just made sure books came first.

"From the time my first child was born, I wanted books and reading first - have that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens."

The actual rule in her house is pretty simple: they turn the TV on when they're going to watch something specific, and almost always as a family. Not much solo watching. That's basically it.

By the time screens became part of her kids' lives, the reading habit was already there. The foundation was set. She didn't have to fight anything because there was nothing to fight.

## THE QUIET EXIT

Remember when everyone predicted that homeschooling was just a pandemic blip? That families would return to normal once schools reopened?

[Johns Hopkins](https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/homeschool-growth-2024-2025/) just released their 2024-2025 data, and the numbers tell a different story. Homeschooling is growing at 5.4% annually - nearly three times the pre-pandemic rate. Eight states hit all-time high enrollment this year.

Angela Watson, the Johns Hopkins researcher who's been tracking this for a decade, put it plainly: "This isn't a pandemic hangover; it's a fundamental shift in how American families are thinking about education."

There weren't any protests or big policy fights. Millions of families just quietly made a different choice. The interesting question is what they discovered during those COVID years at home that made them decide not to go back.

## TOOL: SAVVY LEARNING

Speaking of Janssen - her second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade, and she was drifting further down with every assessment.

Janssen tried working with her directly, but it didn't go well. The kid would scream, cry, refuse to engage. It was miserable for everyone.

Then during COVID, an intern from the school offered to tutor her online - just 20 minutes a day, nothing fancy. White screen, black words, basic reading practice.

Something clicked. The daughter would get on with the tutor without any complaint. She'd be swimming in the pool, come inside for her session, do her 20 minutes, and go back out. No drama, no resistance.

Within weeks they started seeing real progress. By fifth grade, she was reading at an 11th grade level.

That tutoring approach eventually became [Savvy Learning](https://www.savvylearning.co/), which is now available in the [OpenEd Marketplace](https://openedmarketplace.com/). It's live 1-on-1 tutoring for reading and math - 20-25 minute sessions, four times a week, meeting kids exactly where they are. Worth checking out if you have a reader who's struggling, or one who's way ahead and needs more of a challenge.

Sometimes a different voice is what the kid needs.

That's all for today!
