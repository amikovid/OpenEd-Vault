# A Parrot, a Man, and the Point of Algebra

Greetings Eddies!

Remember that logic puzzle I teased in last week's roundup? The one with the parrot on the pirate's head? I promised to break it down, then promptly forgot. Let's fix that, shall we?

---

## The Puzzle

A pirate stands with a parrot on his head (we'll call him Robert). When Robert stands with the parrot on his head, their combined height is 200 centimeters.

When Robert stands next to the parrot on the ground, the difference between their heights is 170 centimeters.

How tall is the parrot?

Take a minute with it before you scroll down. Think about how you might solve the puzzle.

I'll be honest with you… the first time I saw the puzzle, I worked it out on paper. The second time, I used ChatGPT to verify my answer and explain the "right" way to solve it.

And judging by the comments when this puzzle went viral, I wasn't alone. A lot of adults either reached for a tool, gave up, or just scrolled past entirely. Are we losing the ability to do this kind of thinking for ourselves?

This is Algebra 1. Two equations, two unknowns. The kind of thing millions of us spent years practicing in school. And yet a cartoon bird stumped us.

Maybe our mental muscles are atrophying - maybe having the answer always one prompt away has quietly eroded something we used to be able to do. Or maybe we never really learned it in the first place. We learned to follow procedures well enough to pass a test, but we never learned to *see* the structure of a problem. The worksheets drilled compliance, but not true comprehension.

## How People Actually Solved It

When we posted this puzzle on Facebook, the answers rolled in - and people got there through different paths.

Cassandra made her son do it: "He got to the answer. 15!"

Daisy worked it out with a joke: "Parrot is 15 (inches, poor tiny man)."

Bridget described it intuitively: "2 bird-sized equal mystery spaces that must bring the total to 200 from 170."

Rebecca and Linlea just dropped the answer: "15."

And Hillary? She was more concerned with why the pirate looks like Matt Walsh.

The "right" way to solve this is algebraic elimination. But plenty of people got there through spatial reasoning, guess-and-check, or just seeing the pattern. The path matters less than the destination - and whether your kid can find *a* path at all.

## The Solution (For the Record)

Here's the textbook approach. If your kid is anywhere near algebra right now, this makes for a perfect napkin problem at dinner.

**Step 1: Name what you don't know.**

Let's call the man's height M and the parrot's height P. We're solving for either, which will give us both.

**Step 2: Translate the words into equations.**

- "Their combined height is 200" becomes: **M + P = 200**
- "The difference in their heights is 170" becomes: **M - P = 170**

**Step 3: Here's the trick - add the equations together.**

When you do that, something elegant happens. The P's cancel out:

```
  M + P = 200
+ M - P = 170
-----------
  2M     = 370
```

Now, if you have to, you can pull out your calculator to find that M = 185. The man is 185 centimeters tall.

**Step 4: Plug back in to find the parrot.**

If M + P = 200 and M = 185, then P = 15.

The parrot is 15 centimeters.

## The Point

That move - adding equations to eliminate a variable - is called "elimination." Once you see it, you can't unsee it. The problem goes from impossible to obvious.

Most people who "learned" this in school don't remember it because they memorized steps for a test instead of building intuition. Isaac Morehouse, OpenEd's CEO, [wrote about this years ago](https://opened.co/blog/i-played-with-legos-instead-of-doing-math): "Algebra is about figuring out puzzles when you don't have all the pieces. I loved solving for X, as long as it was the X-Wing spacecraft." He spent his childhood building LEGO instead of doing worksheets - and he was doing algebra the whole time without knowing it.

Platforms like [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/) and [Recess](https://recess.gg/) have figured this out: kids don't hate math, they hate worksheets divorced from context. When you dress the same problem up as a game or a puzzle, something clicks. The framing *is* the learning.

## Do Try This at Home

- **Give your kid the parrot puzzle.** Don't help. Let them sit with it.
- **If they're stuck:** "What do you know? What don't you know?"
- **If they're really stuck:** "What happens if you add those two things together?"

That last nudge is the whole lesson. Once they see it, they own it forever.

I solved this puzzle with ChatGPT. My eighth-grade self probably could have done it cold. Using a calculator because you understand the math is leverage. Using one because you can't do the math is dependency. The parrot puzzle is a little diagnostic - it tells you what stuck and what didn't.

If your kid is struggling with algebra, maybe skip the next worksheet and hand them a parrot instead. (And if you're looking for a curriculum that builds this kind of thinking, we put together a [guide to homeschool math options](https://opened.co/blog/best-homeschool-math-curriculum).)

## LinkedIn (Option 1 - The Community Angle)

A viral parrot puzzle asked: if a man and parrot together are 200cm, and apart differ by 170cm, how tall is the parrot?

When OpenEd posted this, parents arrived at 15 through completely different paths:

- One mom made her son solve it. He nailed it.
- Another described it spatially: "2 bird-sized mystery spaces bringing 200 down to 170."
- Several just dropped the answer with no work shown.

The "correct" method is algebraic elimination - adding equations to cancel variables. But guess-and-check works. Spatial reasoning works. Pattern recognition works.

The takeaway for education: there's rarely one right path to understanding. The goal is finding *a* path - and building the confidence to walk it.

Kids don't hate math. They hate being told their path is wrong.

## LinkedIn (Option 2 - The Diagnostic Angle)

This algebra puzzle went viral because adults couldn't solve it:

Man + parrot on head = 200cm
Man - parrot beside him = 170cm
How tall is the parrot?

It's two equations, two unknowns. Algebra 1. The kind of thing millions practiced for years in school.

And yet a cartoon bird stumped them.

The answer is 15. Add the equations: 2M = 370, so M = 185, so P = 15.

But here's what the puzzle really reveals: most people memorized procedures without building intuition. They passed the test, then forgot the skill.

When learning is divorced from context - when it's worksheets instead of puzzles - nothing sticks.

Platforms like Synthesis and Recess have figured this out. Frame the same problem as a game, and something clicks.

The parrot puzzle is a little diagnostic. It shows what stuck and what didn't.

## LinkedIn (Option 3 - The Paths Angle)

How many ways can you solve this puzzle?

Man + parrot = 200cm. Man - parrot = 170cm. How tall is the parrot?

The "correct" answer: algebraic elimination. Add the equations, cancel the variable, solve for 15.

But when this went viral, people got there through:
- Spatial reasoning ("2 bird-sized spaces")
- Guess-and-check
- Making their kid do it
- Just... seeing it

The path matters less than arriving. And whether someone can find *a* path at all.

That's the real lesson for education. Stop insisting on one method. Start asking: can they get there?

## X/Twitter Thread

**1/** This algebra puzzle went viral because adults couldn't solve it.

Man + parrot on head = 200
Man - parrot beside him = 170

How tall is the parrot?

Take 30 seconds. Actually try. 🧵

**2/** The "correct" method: add the equations together.

(M + P) + (M - P) = 200 + 170
2M = 370
M = 185

Plug back in: P = 15

**3/** But when this went viral, people got there through completely different paths:

- Spatial reasoning
- Guess-and-check  
- Making their kid solve it
- Just... seeing it

The method matters less than arriving.

**4/** @IsaacMorehouse nailed this years ago:

"Algebra is about figuring out puzzles when you don't have all the pieces. I loved solving for X, as long as it was the X-Wing spacecraft."

**5/** Most people who "learned" this in school don't remember it.

Not because they're dumb - because they memorized procedures instead of building intuition.

Worksheets drill compliance. Puzzles build understanding.

**6/** Try this at dinner tonight:

1. Give your kid the parrot puzzle
2. Let them struggle
3. If stuck: "What happens if you add those two things together?"

That one nudge is the whole lesson.
