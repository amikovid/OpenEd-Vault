# Checkpoint 1: Angles & Structure - 2026-01-21

**Theme:** Parents know their kids. The system doesn't trust them. The data says they're right.

## SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS

**Curiosity:**
1. Why does the coverage never match the data?
2. The question Brett Pike is asking
3. What the headlines never mention
4. You've probably seen the headlines

**Specificity:**
5. Outperform in science, math, history, English, ACT, SAT
6. The myth Robert Enlow has heard since 1996
7. "The child is not the mere creature of the state" - 1925

**Hybrid:**
8. Homeschoolers outperform on every metric. The headlines say otherwise.
9. The data says one thing. The coverage says another.
10. They outperform on every test. So why the negative press?

## PREVIEW TEXT

Draft: Homeschool students outperform in science, math, history, English, ACT, and SAT. Yet mainstream publications keep running the same warning stories. PLUS: why Robert Enlow has heard the same myth since 1996.

## SEGMENT 1: THOUGHT - The Coverage Gap

**Source:** [Brett Pike (@ClassicLearner)](https://twitter.com/ClassicLearner)

**The Tweet:**
> "Homeschool students outperform public school peers in:
> -Science
> -Math
> -History
> -English
> -The ACT
> -& the SAT
>
> Yet, whenever mainstream publications write articles about it they almost always seem to attack homeschooling.
>
> Now, why do you think that is?"

**Context:** This was in response to an Atlantic article with a headline like "He was homeschooled for years. He fell so far behind." We don't need to link to it or name it - just point to the pattern.

**Angle Options:**

**A. The Pattern**
You've probably seen the headlines. Mainstream publications writing about homeschooling almost always frame it as a problem to be solved, a risk to be managed. But the data tells a different story: homeschoolers outperform their public school peers on every metric that matters.

**B. The Question**
Lead with Pike's question: Why does the coverage never match the data? Science, math, history, English, ACT, SAT - homeschoolers outperform. Yet the headlines keep warning you about the dangers.

**C. Don't Name It**
Reference the pattern without naming the Atlantic piece. "You might have seen another article this week warning about the dangers of homeschooling..." Then drop the data.

**Recommended: A** - State the pattern plainly. Don't attack the publications, just notice the gap. Let the reader draw conclusions.

## SEGMENT 2: TREND - The Myth Since 1996

**Source:** [EdChoice Podcast](https://www.edchoice.org/podcast/ep-3-tough-questions-with-robert-enlow-do-parents-know-whats-best-for-their-kids/)

**Angle Options:**

**A. The Oldest Myth**
Robert Enlow has been in education policy since 1996. The myth he's heard every single day: parents don't know what they're doing. But the 1925 Supreme Court already settled this: "The child is not the mere creature of the state."

**B. The Data Contradiction**
The critics say parents can't choose. The research says the opposite: students in choice programs perform better, graduate at higher rates, and their parents become better choosers over time.

**C. The Real Problem**
Enlow's argument: the issue isn't that parents lack capability. It's that "they don't have the information or the power." When they get both, they outperform the system.

**Recommended: A** - The longevity of the myth (since 1996) + the Supreme Court quote makes this feel weighty. The data supports but doesn't lead.

## SEGMENT 3: TOOL - Preply

**Source:** [Preply](https://preply.com/)

**Angle Options:**

**A. The Language Gap Solution**
Homeschool families often feel unqualified for foreign languages. Preply connects you with native speakers - 100,000 tutors, 90+ languages, 25-minute trial lessons. Your kid practices with someone from Madrid, not a textbook.

**B. The "Different Voice" Frame**
Like we talked about last issue with reading tutors - sometimes kids need a different voice. Preply gives you that for languages. Native speakers, flexible scheduling, your terms.

**C. Straight Stats**
100,000 tutors. 90+ languages. 92% of learners say their tutor motivates them. 4.8/5 rating from 21,000+ reviews. One-on-one with native speakers, starting at $5/hour for some languages.

**Recommended: A** - Addresses a real pain point (languages) with a clear solution. The "different voice" callback could work if we want continuity with the Janssen issue.

## ORTHOGONALITY CHECK

| Segment | Core Message | Distinct From Others |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| THOUGHT | Media attacks homeschooling despite data showing outperformance | Observation about coverage pattern |
| TREND | 30-year institutional myth, Supreme Court already settled it | Policy/research scope |
| TOOL | Native speakers for languages | Practical resource |

- [x] Thought and Trend are distinct (media pattern vs. policy history)
- [x] Aligns with OpenEd beliefs (parents know best, institutions resist)
- [x] Would Sarah forward this? (Yes - the coverage gap is relatable frustration)

---

## NOTES

- THOUGHT observes the pattern (media vs. data), TREND explains the institutional roots (since 1996, Pierce case)
- Don't link to or name the Atlantic article - just reference the pattern
- Pike's tweet is the anchor; the list of outperformance areas is shareable
