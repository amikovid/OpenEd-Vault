## THOUGHT: Brett Pike on Media Coverage Gap

**Source:** [Brett Pike (@ClassicLearner) on X](https://twitter.com/ClassicLearner)

**The Tweet (in response to an Atlantic article attacking homeschooling):**
> "Homeschool students outperform public school peers in:
> -Science
> -Math
> -History
> -English
> -The ACT
> -& the SAT
>
> Yet, whenever mainstream publications write articles about it they almost always seem to attack homeschooling.
>
> Now, why do you think that is?"

**Context:**
This was a response to an Atlantic piece with a headline like "He was homeschooled for years. He fell so far behind" (by Stefan Merrill Block, who also wrote a NYT piece). We don't need to link to or name the Atlantic article - just reference the pattern.

**Data Supporting Pike:**
- HSLDA data: homeschoolers score 15-30 percentile points higher than public school students on standardized exams
- More than 78% of studies show homeschoolers' statistical superiority
- Performance advantage holds regardless of income or parental education

## TREND: EdChoice - "Do Parents Really Know What's Best for Their Kids?"

**Source:** [EdChoice Podcast Episode 3](https://www.edchoice.org/podcast/ep-3-tough-questions-with-robert-enlow-do-parents-know-whats-best-for-their-kids/) (January 5, 2026)

**Speaker:** Robert Enlow, President and CEO of EdChoice

**Central Argument:**
"This is the myth that I have heard every day of my career since 1996, that parents don't know what they're doing."

**Key Points:**

1. **Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925):** Oregon passed a law requiring every family to attend government-run public schools. A family sued. Supreme Court ruled: "The child is not the mere creature of the state."

2. **Why parents aren't trusted:**
   - Historical system dependency (housing prices = school access)
   - Some opponents deliberately argue parents lack capability
   - This criticism disproportionately targets low-income families and families of color

3. **The real issue:** "They don't often have the information or the power."

4. **What happens when parents choose:**
   - Students perform slightly better on state tests
   - Higher graduation and college matriculation rates
   - Public schools improve faster when choice exists
   - Greater tolerance of differing opinions
   - More family engagement with schools

**Memorable Quotes:**
- "Parents are the first educators."
- "When you have skin in the game, you make better decisions."
- "Parents have the first and greatest ability to hold schools accountable."

**Research Citation:**
Patrick Wolf's research shows parents become "better and better" choosers over time when given freedom.

## Thematic Connections

**Thread:** The data says homeschoolers excel. Institutions and media say parents can't be trusted. The gap between coverage and reality is the story.

- THOUGHT: Brett Pike's observation - homeschoolers outperform on every metric, yet mainstream coverage almost always attacks
- TREND: Robert Enlow has heard the "parents don't know" myth since 1996. Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) already settled this.
- TOOL: When parents need help with languages, Preply provides expert tutors on their terms

**Contrast with mainstream narrative:**
Media: "He was homeschooled. He fell so far behind."
Reality: Outperform in science, math, history, English, ACT, SAT. When parents choose, outcomes improve.
