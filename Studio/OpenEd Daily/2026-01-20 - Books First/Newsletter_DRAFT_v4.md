Greetings Eddies!

Now, onto the good stuff. Before the holidays, Ela sat down with Janssen Bradshaw for the [Open Ed Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@OpenEducation). Janssen runs [Everyday Reading](https://everyday-reading.com/) and has over half a million followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/everydayreading) where she shares book recommendations for families. She also co-founded Savvy Learning, which is in our marketplace.

We're still sifting through gems from this conversation - there were a lot of them. This week we're focusing on one thing she said that stuck with me: how she gets her four daughters to choose books over screens without actually fighting screens at all.

Let's dive in.

## BOOKS FIRST

"Screens will always win the dopamine battle."

That's how Janssen put it. She spends most of her workday on Instagram and her phone - it's how she makes a living. She's not anti-screen. But from the time her first child was born, she made sure books came first.

"From the time my first child was born, I wanted books and reading first - have that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens."

The actual rule in her house is pretty simple: they turn the TV on when they're going to watch something specific, and almost always as a family. Not much solo watching. That's basically it.

By the time screens became part of her kids' lives, the reading habit was already there. The foundation was set.

## THE QUIET EXIT

Remember when everyone predicted that homeschooling was just a pandemic blip? That families would return to normal once schools reopened?

[Johns Hopkins](https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/homeschool-growth-2024-2025/) just released their 2024-2025 data, and the numbers tell a different story. Homeschooling is growing at 5.4% annually - nearly three times the pre-pandemic rate. Eight states hit all-time high enrollment this year.

Angela Watson, the Johns Hopkins researcher who's been tracking this for a decade, put it plainly: "This isn't a pandemic hangover; it's a fundamental shift in how American families are thinking about education."

The question worth asking is what families discovered during those COVID years at home that made them decide not to go back.

## TOOL: SAVVY LEARNING

If you're worried about whether your kid might be behind on reading, check out [Savvy Learning](https://www.savvylearning.co/) - they're in the [OpenEd Marketplace](https://openedmarketplace.com/).

It's live 1-on-1 tutoring for reading and math. 20-25 minute sessions, four times a week, meeting kids exactly where they are.

Janssen's second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade, drifting further down with every assessment. Janssen tried working with her directly, but the kid would scream, cry, refuse to engage. Then during COVID, an intern from the school offered to tutor her online - just 20 minutes a day.

Something clicked. The daughter would get on without any complaint, do her 20 minutes, and that was it. Within weeks they started seeing real progress. By fifth grade, she was reading at an 11th grade level.

Sometimes a different voice is what the kid needs.

That's all for today!
