# Checkpoint 1 v2: Finding the Real Angles

**Theme:** Books vs screens, but actually interesting

---

## What's the Obvious Take Everyone Has?

- "Limit screen time"
- "Screens are ruining kids"
- "Fight the battle"
- "Hold the line"

**The problem:** This is preachy and everyone's heard it. It's also not working.

## SEGMENT 1: THOUGHT - Janssen Bradshaw

### What She Actually Said (the interesting parts):

1. "I love screens. My whole living is made online, basically on my phone."
2. "Screens will always win the dopamine battle."
3. "From the time my first child was born, I wanted books and reading first - and have that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens."
4. "We turn the TV on when we're actually gonna watch something. Almost always as a family - not a lot of solo watching."

### What's the Contrarian Truth Here?

She's not fighting screens. She's not limiting them. She's not even anti-screen.

She just... sequenced it. Books came first. That's it.

**The "You're the Problem" Move:**
Parents are out here treating screens like an enemy to be defeated, when they're actually the ones who handed kids the iPad in the first place because it was easier.

Janssen's not judging - she just noticed something obvious: You can't compete with dopamine. Don't try. Get there first.

### Angle Options:

**Angle A: "Stop Fighting"**
The obvious truth everyone knows: you're not going to win the dopamine battle. Screens are designed by the smartest people in the world to capture attention. So stop fighting. Get there first.

**Angle B: "You're the Adult"**
Pirate Wires style - channel the "O accursed parents of modernity, you've forgotten that you guys are literally adults" energy. You don't need a strategy. You need to make a decision and stick to it.

**Angle C: "The Non-Competitor"**
She has 2,000 books and makes her living on her phone. This isn't a puritan telling you screens are evil. It's someone who realized books don't have to compete if they come first.

**Recommended: Angle C** - It's surprising, permission-giving, and has the "I'm not who you think I am" hook.

## SEGMENT 2: TREND - Johns Hopkins Data

### The Actual Numbers:

**Source:** [JHU Homeschool Growth 2024-2025](https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/homeschool-growth-2024-2025/)

- Homeschooling growing at **5.4%** annually
- That's **nearly 3x the pre-pandemic growth rate** (was ~2%)
- 8 states at **all-time high** enrollment
- New Hampshire and Vermont rebounded 14.5% and 17%
- Angela R. Watson (JHU researcher): "This isn't a pandemic hangover; it's a fundamental shift"

### What's the Obvious Take?

"Homeschooling is growing." Boring. Everyone's said it.

### What's the Contrarian Truth?

Everyone predicted the "return to normal." It didn't happen.

**The interesting question:** What did families discover that made them stay?

They found out they actually... like their kids? Like spending time with them? Like reading on the couch instead of rushing to the bus stop?

**The "You're the Problem" Move:**
Institutions keep waiting for families to come back. They're not coming back. They found something better.

### Angle Options:

**Angle A: "The Prediction Failure"**
Everyone said homeschooling was a blip. It's 3x the pre-pandemic growth rate. The experts were wrong (again).

**Angle B: "What Did They Find?"**
Skip the growth numbers. Ask the better question: what did families discover during COVID that made them refuse to go back?

**Angle C: "The Quiet Exodus"**
No protests. No policy fights. Just millions of parents quietly making a different choice. And the institutions still don't get it.

**Recommended: Angle B** - It connects naturally to the THOUGHT (families who read together discovered something worth keeping).

## SEGMENT 3: TOOL - Savvy Learning

### The Story:

Janssen's second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade. Drifting further down every assessment. Teacher flagged it at parent-teacher conference.

Janssen started working with her. Daughter resisted. Screamed. Cried. Didn't want to work with mom.

During COVID, an intern from the school offered to tutor her online. 20 minutes a day. Just a white screen with black words.

The daughter got on with no complaint. Swam in the pool, came inside, did the session. No resistance.

Within weeks: major progress.
By fifth grade: reading at 11th grade level.

That program became [Savvy Learning](https://www.savvylearning.co/). Now in the OpenEd Marketplace.

### What's the Obvious Take?

"Get tutoring for struggling readers."

### What's the Contrarian Truth?

Sometimes your kid doesn't want to work with you. And that's fine.

**The "You're the Problem" Move:**
Parents feel guilty when their kid resists working with them. They think it's a failure. It's not. Sometimes a different voice is what the kid needs.

### Angle Options:

**Angle A: "Get Out of the Way"**
The permission angle: it's not a failure to outsource. Sometimes the best thing you can do is bring in someone else.

**Angle B: "The 20-Minute Fix"**
20 minutes a day, 4 days a week, at exactly the right level. That's it. Consistency + right level = results.

**Angle C: "The Transformation"**
Barely at grade level → 11th grade reading level. That's the story. The how is almost secondary.

**Recommended: Angle A** - Most relatable pain point, most permission-giving.

## Orthogonality Check

| Segment | What It's About | Why It's Different |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| THOUGHT | Janssen's philosophy: sequence, don't compete | Personal story, one family's approach |
| TREND | Johns Hopkins data: what families discovered | National scope, systemic observation |
| TOOL | Savvy Learning: the specific solution | Concrete resource, actionable |

THOUGHT = Philosophy
TREND = Evidence
TOOL = Action

They connect (families finding what works → data shows they're staying → here's a specific thing that works) without repeating.

## What's Still Missing

Before writing the draft, I need to nail:

1. **The opening hook** - Something that makes you lean in. Not "Here's a question that keeps parents up at night" (cringe).

2. **The subject line** - But only after the draft is solid. Don't put lipstick on a pig.

3. **The actual voice** - Read it aloud. Does it sound like a person talking? Or like someone performing "newsletter writer"?
