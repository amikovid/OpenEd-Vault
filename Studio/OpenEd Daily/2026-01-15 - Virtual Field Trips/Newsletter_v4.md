**SUBJECT:** Tour a particle accelerator before lunch
**PREVIEW:** Schools turned "field trip" into a whole production. Permission slips, buses, chaperones. What if it was just... Tuesday?

Greetings Eddies!

Schools have turned field trips into productions. Permission slips. Liability waivers. A bus that leaves at 6am. Thirty kids herded through a museum while a docent reads from a script. By the time you've organized the whole thing, the actual learning feels like an afterthought.

Homeschoolers don't have this problem. Going somewhere and learning stuff can just be Tuesday.

## THE ANYWHERE CLASSROOM

Melissa Barryman used to be an assistant principal. Now she homeschools, and she told a Florida reporter something that stuck with me: "I love that learning can take place anywhere." She's not being metaphorical. Her family drove to Texas to watch the solar eclipse. They've done hands-on learning in D.C. The curriculum follows them - not the other way around.

This sounds aspirational, but most homeschool families don't actually use this superpower. They recreate school at home. Same schedule, same worksheets, same walls. The "anywhere classroom" stays theoretical.

It doesn't have to. As one family told us in our piece on [worldschooling](https://opened.co/blog/worldschooling-without-the-plane-ticket): "Learning is everywhere - it's not just in school for seven hours. It's every day and everywhere that you go." The location matters less than the mindset.

## THE TRAVEL CURRICULUM

[72% of Florida homeschool parents](https://www.wusf.org/education/2025-12-06/homeschooling-on-the-rise-across-florida-families-seeking-flexibility) cite "desire to emphasize family life" as their reason for leaving traditional schools. Travel is a big part of how they use that flexibility. Field trips become multi-day experiences instead of rushed six-hour outings.

The Moffatt family has six kids. They built their entire homeschool around this: "We wanted me to have more influence over the children than a whole bunch of teachers we didn't know." That influence includes deciding when and where learning happens.

[Maecy Palkki](https://opened.co/blog/is-homeschooling-the-wrong-word-were-only-home-3-hours-a-day-maecy-palkki) calls herself an "adventure schooler." Her family spends maybe three hours at home doing bookwork. Everything else is out - friends, field trips, skiing, kayaking. The traditional school calendar was designed for an agricultural economy. She's designing something else.

## WORLD-CLASS FIELD TRIPS

Virtual field trips sound like a consolation prize. Can't afford Switzerland? Here's a screen. But [NatureEye](https://natureeye.io) flips this. You're not getting a watered-down version of the experience. You're getting something better: live interaction with the actual scientists who work at CERN, Antarctic researchers answering your kid's questions in real time, behind-the-scenes access tourists can't get.

Cost is $10-20 per experience. Some ESA programs cover it. And "field trip" stops being a yearly production - it becomes a weekly possibility.

[Charlynn Chambers](https://opened.co/blog/episode-016-how-to-transform-everyday-moments-into-powerful-learning-experiences-with-charlynn-chambers) finds learning opportunities everywhere, from pancake-making to farmer's markets. Virtual field trips are the same idea at scale. The physicist at CERN doesn't care that you're in Kansas.

That's all for today!
