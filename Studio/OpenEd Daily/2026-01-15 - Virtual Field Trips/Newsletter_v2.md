Greetings Eddies!

One of homeschooling's best features is also its most underused: the world is your classroom.

The whole world. Literally.

Let's dive in.

## THE ANYWHERE CLASSROOM

Melissa Barryman, a former assistant principal turned homeschool mom, said something that stuck with me:

**"I love that learning can take place anywhere."**

She meant it literally. Her family has traveled to Texas to see the solar eclipse. They've done hands-on learning in Washington D.C. The curriculum follows the family—not the other way around.

This is one of homeschooling's genuine superpowers. No permission slips. No 6am bus departures. No herding 30 kids through a museum.

Just: we're going there, and we'll learn while we're at it.

What most people miss: "anywhere" doesn't have to mean expensive travel.

"Anywhere" can mean your kitchen table—with the right tools.

The goal isn't to turn education into a travel budget. It's to realize that the walls of a classroom are artificial. Learning happens where curiosity meets opportunity.

Sometimes that's the Grand Canyon. Sometimes that's a YouTube video about the Grand Canyon. Sometimes it's a virtual tour led by a scientist who actually works there.

The location matters less than the mindset. As we've explored before in [worldschooling without the plane ticket](https://opened.co/blog/worldschooling-without-the-plane-ticket): "Learning is everywhere—it's not just in school for seven hours. It's every day and everywhere that you go."

## THE TRAVEL CURRICULUM

The families leaving traditional schools often cite flexibility as the reason—and travel is a big part of how they use it.

From the [Florida homeschool data](https://www.wusf.org/education/2025-12-06/homeschooling-on-the-rise-across-florida-families-seeking-flexibility):
- 72% of parents cite "desire to emphasize family life"
- Families report integrating travel into curriculum
- Field trips become multi-day learning experiences, not rushed one-day outings

The Moffatt family, with six kids, built their homeschool around flexibility: "We wanted me to have more of an influence over the children than a whole bunch of variety of other teachers that we didn't know."

That influence includes deciding when and where learning happens.

[Maecy Palkki](https://opened.co/blog/is-homeschooling-the-wrong-word-were-only-home-3-hours-a-day-maecy-palkki), a mom of five who appeared on the OpenEd podcast, calls herself an "adventure schooler." She says her family spends maybe three hours at home doing bookwork. Everything else is out—friends, field trips, skiing, kayaking.

The traditional school calendar was designed for an agricultural economy that no longer exists. Homeschool families are designing something different: education that fits around life, not life that fits around school.

## WORLD-CLASS FIELD TRIPS

Can't travel to Switzerland to see CERN? Don't have an Antarctic expedition in the budget?

[NatureEye](https://natureeye.io) brings the world's most inaccessible places to your screen—with interactive, guided experiences led by the people who actually work at these places.

**What it offers:**
- Virtual tours of CERN's particle accelerator
- Live interactions with Antarctic researchers
- Behind-the-scenes access to places tourists can't go
- Curriculum-aligned content for homeschool integration

**Why it matters:**
- Geographic limits disappear
- Kids meet real scientists, not just read about them
- "Field trip" becomes a weekly possibility, not a yearly event

The cost is modest (typically around $10-20 per experience), and some ESA programs cover it.

[Charlynn Chambers](https://opened.co/blog/episode-016-how-to-transform-everyday-moments-into-powerful-learning-experiences-with-charlynn-chambers), another OpenEd parent, talks about finding learning opportunities everywhere—from pancake-making to farmer's markets. Virtual field trips are the same idea scaled up. The physicist at CERN doesn't care that you're in Kansas.

That's all for today!

P.S. Where's the coolest place your family has learned? Virtual or physical—I want to hear about it. Hit reply.

## REVISION NOTES

**Human Detector fixes:**
- "Here's the thing most people miss:" → "What most people miss:"
- "Not metaphorically. Literally." → "The whole world. Literally."
- "This isn't 'watch a documentary.' It's interactive..." → Integrated naturally into the sentence
