Greetings Eddies!

Next week we're dropping a conversation that's been years in the making.

Isaac finally sat down with his old friend Joshua Fields Millburn - co-founder of The Minimalists, Emmy-nominated filmmaker, NYT bestselling author. You might know him from the Netflix documentaries or the podcast with 140+ million downloads.

What does minimalism have to do with education? Turns out, a lot. Joshua's 12-year-old daughter is dyslexic and thriving in an unschool environment. The conversation went places we didn't expect.

Let's dive in.

## THE APOPHATIC APPROACH

*By Isaac Morehouse*

I've been thinking about a conversation I had with Joshua Fields Millburn recently.

You know his famous line: "Love people, use things." It hit me during our talk that this is basically what we tell parents at OpenEd all the time. Love kids, use education. School, curricula, pedagogical approaches - these are tools. They're not the thing doing the driving. Your kid is.

But here's where it got interesting. We started talking about something I've been calling the apophatic approach to parenting.

Rather than asking "what is good parenting?" or "what is a good education?" - flip it around. What is NOT bad? How do I not screw this up?

I tell young people the same thing about their careers: don't do stuff you hate. But hate is not the same as hard. Watch kids working on a Lego set or trying to beat a level in a video game. It's hard, but they're having a blast. They don't avoid hard things. They avoid meaningless things.

You don't know what you love yet. But as long as you don't do stuff that sucks your soul and keep moving forward, you'll keep adding to the list of things you hate until you end up somewhere you love.

The ancient Greeks had a word for what we're avoiding: **pleonexia** - greed for things that can be counted. Grades, test scores, credits, accolades. All things that can be counted but don't measure joy.

## NO SHOULDS, ONLY COULDS

Joshua said something during our conversation that I keep coming back to.

"There are no shoulds, there are only coulds."

Should my daughter be enrolled in a sport? Should she learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus at some point?

No. There are no shoulds with respect to education. Only coulds.

This reframes the entire conversation anxious parents have about what their kids "need." The pressure dissolves when you realize most of it is imaginary. You're not failing to meet requirements. You're choosing from possibilities.

Joshua puts it another way: "Joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered. It's buried beneath the clutter."

We keep adding enrichment, activities, curricula. Maybe the breakthrough comes from removing what's in the way.

## THE ENTRYWAY RULE

Joshua and his wife have something they call the entryway rule.

Their phones stay at the door.

That's it. They can still use them like a home phone - if someone calls, they walk over and answer. But the distractions don't follow them around the house.

"I'm not deprived of the thing," Joshua said. "But the distractions don't follow me around."

Simple. Concrete. You could implement this tonight.

## SCROLLING IS THE NEW SMOKING

Speaking of screens - The Minimalists just dropped a TEDx talk you should watch before our episode.

They quit social media for a year. Had their most successful year ever.

The talk is called "Scrolling Is the New Smoking." It's a good primer for where our conversation goes next week.

### (WORD) OF THE DAY

## Pleonexia

**Pleonexia** [plee-oh-NEK-see-uh], *noun* (Greek): Greed for things that can be counted.

The ancient Greeks had a word for the disease infecting modern education. Grades, test scores, credits, accolades - all things that can be counted but don't measure growth. Or joy.

That's all for today!
