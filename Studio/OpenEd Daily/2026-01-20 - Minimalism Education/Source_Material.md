## Best Quotes for Segments

### THOUGHT Candidates (Isaac voice - his reflection on the conversation)

**"Love Kids, Use Education"**
> ISAAC: "Love people use things. And it made me think, man, that is actually really similar to what we talk about with parents at Open Ed all the time, which is like love kids use education. School, curricula, different pedagogical approaches, these are tools. Those are not the thing that should be doing the driving. It's your kid and what they need."

**Isaac's "Apophatic Approach"**
> ISAAC: "The apophatic approach to parenting... rather than asking what is good parenting or what is a good education, just flipping that around and saying, what is not bad? Like, how do I not do? Don't do stuff you hate. You don't know what you love yet. As long as you don't do stuff that sucks your soul and keep moving forward. You'll keep adding to the list of things you hate until you end up somewhere you love."

**"Hate Is Not the Same as Hard"**
> ISAAC: "I always tell young people with their career, don't do stuff you hate. But hate is not the same as hard. Like I'm not saying don't do stuff that's hard, you know, and you see kids, you see kids working on a Lego set or trying to beat a level in a video game and it's hard, but they're having a blast."

### TREND Candidates (Joshua's insights)

**"No Shoulds, Only Coulds"**
> JOSHUA: "There are no shoulds, there are only coulds. So should my daughter be enrolled in a sport? Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus at some point? No, there are no shoulds with respect to education. There are only coulds."

**"Clutter Is Anything That Gets in the Way"**
> JOSHUA: "The way that I think about clutter is anything that gets in the way. Is our coffee grinder clutter? No, of course not. You use it every day. If I put it in your bed before you went to sleep, all of a sudden it would be clutter because it would get in your way."

**"Joy Cannot Be Acquired"**
> JOSHUA: "You realize with minimalism the joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered. It's buried beneath the clutter."

**"Competition Is a Mental Illness"**
> JOSHUA: "I think that type of competition is a mental illness. And I know that's not popular to say... It's like I'm signing a contract with myself to be discontented until I get the thing that I want. And that thing can be graduating from a prestigious kindergarten or it could be going to the quote-unquote right college."

**"Time Dripping vs. Soaking"**
> JOSHUA: "A subtle drip, drip, drip when she's in the classroom trying to read and being forced to raise her hand. And then all of a sudden the time is just soaking the table because there's so much immersion when you're interested in something."

### TOOL Candidates

**"The Entryway Rule"**
> JOSHUA: "We have something called the entryway rule in our home. And that's where our phones go. My wife and I... we leave our phone at the door. I can still use it like a home phone. I'm not deprived of the thing, but the distractions don't follow me around the house."

**"The Clutter Test" (as decision framework)**
Apply to any educational decision: Is this curriculum/activity/schedule getting in the way of my child's joy and growth? If yes, it's clutter. Remove it.

**TEDx Talk: "Scrolling Is the New Smoking"**
The Minimalists' TEDx talk from 2025 - they quit social media for a year and had their most successful year ever. Available on YouTube.

### BONUS: Word of the Day Candidate

**Pleonexia** (Greek)
> JOSHUA: "Ancient Greeks had a word for this, was pleonexia, which roughly translates to greed for things that can be counted."

Perfect for education context: grades, test scores, credits, accolades - all things that can be counted but don't measure joy.
