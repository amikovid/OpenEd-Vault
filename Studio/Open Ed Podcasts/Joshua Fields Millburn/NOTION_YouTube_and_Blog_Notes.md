## YouTube Description

What does minimalism have to do with education?

Joshua Fields Millburn - co-founder of The Minimalists, Emmy-nominated filmmaker, and New York Times bestselling author - has spent over a decade helping people declutter their lives. But when his dyslexic daughter started coming home with stomach aches every morning from traditional school, he realized minimalism applies to more than physical stuff.

In this conversation with OpenEd CEO Isaac Morehouse, Joshua shares his family's journey from public school struggle to thriving in an unschool environment - and the philosophy that made it possible.

**What you'll learn:**
- Why "there are no shoulds, only coulds" when it comes to education decisions
- The ancient Greek concept of "pleonexia" (greed for things that can be counted)
- His controversial take: competitive parenting as a "mental illness"
- The fentanyl analogy for screens (and why context changes everything)
- The "entryway rule" for phones at home
- Why joy cannot be acquired - only uncovered

Whether you're considering alternative education, struggling with screen time boundaries, or just feeling the pressure of "shoulds" in your parenting, this conversation offers a fresh lens.

## Cold Open Script

**Selected**: "No Shoulds, Only Coulds" (18:21-18:52)
**Duration**: ~32 seconds

> "There are no shoulds, there are only coulds. So should my daughter be enrolled in a sport? Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus at some point? No, there are no shoulds with respect to education. There are only coulds. She can do any of those things. The question is, is she compelled by any of them? And if so, her likelihood for success is so much higher. So the question then is, what are you compelled by? And I know the answer is often, I don't know. I don't know what's interesting. I'm sure you do. You just can't intellectualize it in the moment, but you know it when you sit there, when you do it and you look up at the clock and it's way later than you thought because time was just dripping by so quickly..."

What does minimalism have to do with education?

Joshua Fields Millburn - co-founder of The Minimalists, Emmy-nominated filmmaker, and New York Times bestselling author - has spent over a decade helping people declutter their lives. But when his dyslexic daughter started coming home with stomach aches every morning from traditional school, he realized minimalism applies to more than physical stuff.

In this conversation with OpenEd CEO Isaac Morehouse, Joshua shares his family's journey from public school struggle to thriving in an unschool environment - and the philosophy that made it possible.

### The Minimalist Framework for Education Decisions

Joshua's core insight: "There are no shoulds, there are only coulds."

Should my daughter learn an instrument? Should she take calculus? Should she be enrolled in a sport? According to Joshua, these are the wrong questions. There are no educational "shoulds" - only possibilities. The real question is: what compels her?

This reframe dissolves the anxiety that drives so many parenting decisions. You're not failing to meet requirements. You're choosing from an infinite menu of coulds.

### Clutter Isn't Stuff - It's Anything in the Way

Joshua defines clutter as "anything that gets in the way." A coffee grinder isn't clutter - you use it every day. Put it in your bed, and suddenly it is.

The same applies to education. Curriculum, schedules, activities - none of these are inherently clutter. But when they get in the way of a child's joy and growth, they become exactly that.

For Joshua's daughter, traditional school had become clutter. Removing it cleared the path for something better.

### Pleonexia: The Ancient Greek Word for What's Wrong

Joshua introduced a word the ancient Greeks used: **pleonexia** - greed for things that can be counted.

Grades. Test scores. Credits. College acceptances. All things that can be counted, but don't measure what matters. The minimalist approach to education means questioning which metrics actually indicate growth - and which are just pleonexia dressed up as achievement.

### The Entryway Rule

On a practical level, Joshua and his wife keep their phones at the door. They call it the entryway rule.

"I can still use it like a home phone," Joshua explains. "I'm not deprived of the thing. But the distractions don't follow me around the house."

Simple. Concrete. Worth considering for any family navigating screen time.

### Why Joy Cannot Be Acquired

Perhaps the most profound insight from the conversation: "Joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered. It's buried beneath the clutter."

We keep adding - more activities, more enrichment, more curricula. Maybe the breakthrough comes from removing what's in the way.
