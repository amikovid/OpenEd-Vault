## CLIP INVENTORY

### LONG CLIPS (5+ min - YouTube Main Channel)

---

#### Clip 1: "No Shoulds, Only Coulds"

**Duration**: 6:53
**Timestamp**: 13:18 - 20:11
**Category**: LONG

**On-Screen Hook Options**:

1. "No shoulds, only coulds"
2. "The question that changes everything"
3. "Stop shoulding on your kids"
4. "What if there's no right answer?"

**Caption Variations**:

- The question isn't "should my kid learn this?" The question is: are they compelled by it?
- There are no shoulds. Only coulds. @joshuafieldsmillburn explains the framework that changed how he thinks about his daughter's education.
- "Time was just dripping by so quickly... all of a sudden it went from a subtle drip, drip, drip to soaking the table." Joshua Fields Millburn on finding what compels your child.

**Trim Notes**: Core version available at 3:37 (18:21-20:11) if shorter cut needed. For maximum impact, include the setup from 13:18 (Lord of the Flies context, age segregation discussion).

---

#### Clip 5: "Competition Is a Mental Illness"

**Duration**: 5:48
**Timestamp**: 29:57 - 35:45
**Category**: LONG

**On-Screen Hook Options**:

1. "Competition is a mental illness"
2. "The contract you didn't know you signed"
3. "Why achievement won't make you happy"
4. "Signing a contract for discontent"

**Caption Variations**:

- "Competition is a mental illness." @joshuafieldsmillburn isn't being provocative - he's being precise. Here's why achievement culture is a form of consumerism.
- "I'm signing a contract with myself to be discontented until I get the thing I want." Joshua Fields Millburn on why joy cannot be acquired - only uncovered.
- The hedonic treadmill applies to education too. @joshuafieldsmillburn breaks down why more activities, more enrichment, more pressure isn't the answer.

**Trim Notes**: Core section available at 4:09 (31:00-34:06) without Netflix documentary mention at end. Include full ending for natural CTA.

---

### SHORT CLIPS (Under 60 sec - Shorts/Reels/TikTok)

---

#### Clip 2: "Would You Give Your Kids Fentanyl?"

**Duration**: 0:55
**Timestamp**: 20:59 - 22:18 (edited)
**Category**: SHORT

**On-Screen Hook Options**:

1. "Would you give your kids fentanyl?"
2. "The screen question nobody asks"
3. "Context changes everything"
4. "Fentanyl for your kids?"

**Caption Variations**:

- "Would you ever give your kids fentanyl?" @joshuafieldsmillburn asks the question that reframes the entire screen debate.
- Context changes everything. Fentanyl makes sense during surgery. Screens make sense in the right context. @joshuafieldsmillburn
- The ancient Greeks had a word for what's wrong with achievement culture: pleonexia - greed for things that can be counted. @joshuafieldsmillburn

**Trim Notes**: Could trim Isaac's reactions to hit 45 sec. The pleonexia mention at the end is the payoff - keep it.

---

#### Clip 3: "Joy Cannot Be Acquired"

**Duration**: 0:40
**Timestamp**: 33:20 - 34:06
**Category**: SHORT

**On-Screen Hook Options**:

1. "Joy cannot be acquired"
2. "What minimalism taught me about parenting"
3. "Stop acquiring. Start uncovering."
4. "Happiness isn't out there"

**Caption Variations**:

- "Joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered." @joshuafieldsmillburn on why minimalism applies to education.
- What if the answer isn't adding more - it's removing what's in the way? @joshuafieldsmillburn
- For his daughter, public school was clutter. Standardized testing was clutter. It was getting in the way of her joy. @joshuafieldsmillburn

**Trim Notes**: Tight as-is. Works perfectly at 40 seconds.

---

#### Clip 4: "The Entryway Rule"

**Duration**: 0:55
**Timestamp**: 24:06 - 25:32
**Category**: SHORT

**On-Screen Hook Options**:

1. "The entryway rule"
2. "Where your phone should live"
3. "No phone in the bedroom. Ever."
4. "One rule that changed our home"

**Caption Variations**:

- The entryway rule: your phone stays at the door. You're not deprived - the distractions just don't follow you around. @joshuafieldsmillburn
- "The bedroom is the worst place for a phone." @joshuafieldsmillburn on the simple boundary that changed his home.
- You can't tell your kids not to use screens while you're scrolling on the couch. The entryway rule solves this. @joshuafieldsmillburn

**Trim Notes**: Could drop iPad regret ending for 45 sec version. Including "worst way I've screwed up my daughter" line adds punch.

## SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

## LINKEDIN (@isaacmorehouse + @OpenEdHQ)

### LinkedIn - Isaac's Account (Story Framework)

**Post**:

Joshua Fields Millburn has one of the best book titles ever written: "Love People, Use Things."

When I was preparing for our conversation, it hit me. That's basically what we tell parents at OpenEd all the time. Love kids, use education. School, curricula, different pedagogical approaches - these are tools. They're not the thing doing the driving. Your kid is.

Joshua's daughter is dyslexic. She used to come home with stomach aches every morning from the anxiety of going to school. Now she's 12, thriving in an unschool environment, teaching six-year-olds and learning from sixteen-year-olds.

We talked about what I call the apophatic approach to parenting. Rather than asking "what is good parenting?" or "what is a good education?" - flip it around. What is NOT bad? How do I not screw this up?

I tell young people the same thing about their careers: don't do stuff you hate. You don't know what you love yet. As long as you don't do stuff that sucks your soul and keep moving forward, you'll keep adding to the list of things you hate until you end up somewhere you love.

And hate is not the same as hard. Watch kids working on a Lego set or trying to beat a level in a video game. It's hard, but they're having a blast.

Full conversation dropping next week.

### LinkedIn - OpenEd Account (Contrarian Framework)

**Post**:

Joshua Fields Millburn of The Minimalists told us: "There are no shoulds, there are only coulds."

Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus?

No. There are no shoulds with respect to education. Only coulds. She can do any of those things. The question is: is she compelled by any of them?

His daughter is dyslexic. She was miserable in public school - stomach aches every morning. Now she's thriving in an unschool environment.

The difference? They stopped asking what she should learn and started asking what compelled her.

Joshua defines clutter as anything that gets in the way. His coffee grinder isn't clutter - he uses it every day. Put it in the bed before you go to sleep, and suddenly it is.

For his daughter, traditional school had become clutter. It was getting in the way of her joy, her peace. Removing it cleared the path.

Full conversation with @isaacmorehouse dropping next week.

### X - Thread (Post from @isaacmorehouse)

**Tweet 1**:
@joshuafieldsmillburn's daughter is dyslexic.

She was coming home with stomach aches every morning.

Now she's thriving. Here's the framework:

"There are no shoulds, only coulds."

Should she learn karate? Calculus? An instrument?

Wrong question. The question is: what compels her?

**Tweet 3**:
The Greeks had a word for what's wrong with achievement culture:

Pleonexia. Greed for things that can be counted.

Grades. Test scores. Credits.

**Tweet 4**:
"Joy cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered."

For Joshua's daughter, traditional school had become clutter.

Removing it cleared the path.

### Facebook - TEDx Hype Post (Pre-launch)

Before you watch our conversation with Joshua Fields Millburn next week, watch this.

The Minimalists quit social media for a year. They had their most successful year ever.

Their TEDx talk "Scrolling Is the New Smoking" is a good primer for where our conversation goes.

We talked to Joshua about applying this philosophy to kids and education. Full episode dropping [DATE].

### Facebook - Entryway Rule Clip (Practical tip)

One rule worth trying tonight:

Joshua Fields Millburn and his wife keep their phones at the door. They call it the entryway rule.

"I can still use it like a home phone. I'm not deprived. But the distractions don't follow me around the house."

The bedroom? "The worst place for a phone."

Full conversation with Joshua dropping next week.

### Facebook - Clip Share (Entryway Rule)

**Post**:

Simple rule worth trying:

Phones stay at the door.

Joshua Fields Millburn calls it the "entryway rule." You're not deprived of the phone - you can still use it like a home phone. But distractions don't follow you around the house.

The bedroom? Worst place for a phone.
