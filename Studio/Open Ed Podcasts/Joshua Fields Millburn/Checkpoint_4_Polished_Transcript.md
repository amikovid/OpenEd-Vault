## 00:00 Why "Love People, Use Things" Applies to Education

**ISAAC:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I am super excited to be here with Joshua Fields Millburn. He is part of The Minimalists. If you don't know - I can't believe you don't know - The Minimalists are an Emmy-nominated group of Netflix stars, New York Times bestselling authors, podcast hosts. It's Joshua Fields Millburn who's with us today, Ryan Nicodemus, and my good friend who's been on the podcast before, TK Coleman. They have helped millions of people not just eliminate clutter in the physical sense of minimalism - not having too much stuff and learning how to live with less - but it's a much deeper philosophy of emotional clutter, getting rid of those things. A lot more than you would expect. Really excited to have you here, Josh. Welcome to the podcast.

**JOSHUA:** Isaac, thanks so much. You're right. The clutter thing is fascinating because when you think of minimalism, you often think about decluttering. It's like, okay, we got all this physical stuff. And that's the easiest clutter to see. The average American household has 300,000 items in it. And I'd be fine if it was all making us happier and more joyous. It ends up being the opposite. It causes all this other clutter - the mental clutter, the emotional clutter, relationship clutter, career clutter, education. I'm sure we could talk about several of those things today. Thanks for having me.

**ISAAC:** You went on your podcast a while ago and you just kind of in passing mentioned something about your daughter being in school, it wasn't working out, and you made a big switch in her education. I want to get to that in a second - that's kind of what prompted this conversation. But as I was thinking today and preparing for it, it just hit me. You have one of your bestselling books called - one of the greatest titles ever. It's one of those books where if you only read the title, you already got a ton of value: *Love People, Use Things*.

And I know you guys say that a lot, reminding us where things go. Love people, use things. And it made me think, man, that is actually really similar to what we talk about with parents at OpenEd all the time, which is: love kids, use education. School, curricula, different pedagogical approaches - these are tools. Those are not the thing that should be doing the driving. It's your kid and what they need. Love them, focus on them, use all those things as tools. Maybe that's a cheap ripoff of your amazing phrase.

But I want to start with your own education. How were you educated? How has that impacted you? Kind of like before you had kids, because I know for all of us, that's when we start thinking really differently about these things. What was your personal experience and approach to education?

## 02:55 Joshua's Story: Dyslexic, Almost-Dropout, Corporate Climber

**JOSHUA:** I grew up really poor and I was in a public school system that was adequate for most people. I didn't realize when I was young that I'm dyslexic. My daughter is too. But I didn't realize until I had a daughter that I was dyslexic. She was struggling to read and I'm like, "Well yeah, reading is just really hard." And they're like, "No." She did some dyslexia tests and I did them with her and I'm like, oh. So I'm finding out when I'm about 40 years old that I'm dyslexic.

Maybe there's a problem with pathologizing something like that, because I think for some of us - I never knew that I had this disease or problem or malfunction in my brain, as I've heard it described. To me, I just assumed that reading was really difficult. But it actually made me love writing in a way because I got to play with the words and piece them together. It became a strange sort of superpower.

I did not get along well in school. I was a fairly average student, a lot of detentions mostly for not turning in homework - not necessarily behavior, although I had a few of those too. I didn't enjoy being there. I wasn't the type of person who wanted to wait to raise his hand and be called on. Standardized testing did not work very well for me. I was relatively bright, but my test scores didn't show it at all. In fact, it kind of looked the opposite. There were some years I struggled to even pass a grade. There were a few subjects that worked really well for me that I enjoyed, and I tended to get better grades in those subjects because I was compelled by them.

Last year of high school, I tried to drop out. My guidance counselor, Mr. Day - shout out to Mr. Day - 1998 this was, as I was going into my senior year, I tried to drop out. He's like, "Well, you shouldn't because all you need is this one last class this year. How about I give you nothing but study halls and you take this one last class for one semester, and this next semester, you don't even have to show up." And I was like, okay, that'll work. So I even failed at dropping out of high school.

I skipped the whole college route and just went into the corporate world thereafter because I figured that I didn't want to spend more time doing something that I disliked. That's not to say that it's not appropriate for other people.

## 05:37 "Clutter Is Anything That Gets in the Way"

**JOSHUA:** You talked about education clutter. The way that I think about clutter is anything that gets in the way. I was explaining this to my daughter this morning. She was asking something about clutter and I said, "Is our coffee grinder clutter?" And she said, "Well, no, of course not. You use it every day." I said, "That's right. I use it in its context. If I put it in your bed before you went to sleep, all of a sudden it would be clutter because it would get in your way."

Different things get in the way of different people at different times in different contexts. I realized that school wasn't appropriate for me, but it seems to be perfectly appropriate for certain people. It's not a prescription that I think school is bad and here's a better way. Here's a better way *for me*. Eventually I found a better way for my daughter after she really struggled in a couple of years of public school.

## 07:23 The Danger of Turning Labels Into Identity

**ISAAC:** You mentioned something in passing that I can't let go by, because it's a really interesting point. You mentioned that you found out later that you were dyslexic and kind of said offhand that there is a downside to pathologizing certain things.

This is one of those things that can cut both ways. I know a lot of parents I've talked with - realizing "my kid struggles with dyslexia or ADHD or whatever it might be" - sometimes that is this wonderful moment that helps you realize, okay, I have to do something different. There's an unlock that can happen with having a label or a diagnosis.

But there is also a danger to your point. Sometimes kids are really good at weaponizing this. They'll be like, "Well, I have ADHD, so you can't make me do it." And you're like, what do you mean by that? You just don't want to clean your room. You just don't want to sit down for a minute at the dinner table. You're using that label.

In education or otherwise - I'm sure all the people you deal with, there are probably times where they're like, "Yeah, I've got all this clutter, but it's because I have this disorder." Do you have any thoughts on the line between a label or a diagnosis as a danger versus as a help?

**JOSHUA:** I tend to think of it as a label versus an identity. If my label is "I'm a writer," that actually applies only when I'm writing. Everyone's a writer - we all write text messages. What do you mean by "I'm a writer"? That's not a problem. It describes something.

But as soon as it becomes my identity - "I *am* a writer" or "I *am* dyslexic" - now it's actually disempowering. Any time a label transitions into becoming identity - this is who I am - that becomes a bit of a problem.

The way I teach - I teach a writing class online - is that I'm much more interested in the verb than I am the noun. The noun is "I am a writer" and that sounds impressive and it's erudite and okay, what does it mean? I'm much more interested in the verb, the writing, than I am the label or identity as writer. What am I writing? Is it making a difference? Is it meaningful to me? Do other people find value?

If it's adding value to their lives, great. It doesn't matter what label you throw at me. What matters is I did the writing, the verb itself. I think you can map that onto the so-called pathologies as well.

I have OCD and that is a gift and a curse. It is a disease. It's a mental illness as it is labeled. But also, man, it is the most amazing superpower when it is channeled. So what am I going to do with this label that I have? It's just like any object. If I have a baseball bat, is that a weapon or is it a tool? Depends on how I use it.

## 10:17 His Daughter's School Struggle: Stomach Aches Every Morning

**ISAAC:** That OCD, by the way, I think I've seen just a glimpse of it when I came into your studio. It's so perfectly clean. Everyone takes their shoes off immediately. There are little protocols around there that feel kind of OCD, but the result is it is this sacred, peaceful place. So there you go - it's a positive.

Let's talk about your daughter. How old is she?

**JOSHUA:** She's 12.

**ISAAC:** Okay, she's 12. What was her early education experience? What were your thoughts when she was just getting started formally or informally with education?

**JOSHUA:** We live in Southern California now, but at the time she was born in Missoula, Montana. She went to kindergarten and first grade in Missoula to a really good public school. There was Spanish immersion and the offerings at this public school were pretty great. Yet she was miserable.

She would come home with stomach aches. She'd have stomach aches in the morning with the anxiety of going and being forced to try to read or try to participate in things that were more difficult for her than other kids. There were other times where she really loved it - she's super athletic and she's easygoing - and there were parts that she was able to amplify through social interactions. But anytime she was told to sit down and focus, it was really difficult.

One of those other labels, ADHD, was thrown at her as well. Eventually we learned about the dyslexia diagnosis. Those labels were useful in helping us understand why maybe that system didn't work as well for her.

---

## 11:50 Finding Unschool: They Removed All the Desks

**JOSHUA:** We started researching and figuring out what's the next best path forward because what we're doing right now doesn't work. We've tried several things within the system and it still doesn't work. We need to find a new path forward. Is that a different school? Is it a private school? Is it tutoring? Is it homeschool?

Then we learned about this thing called unschooling, which I'm sure you're familiar with at this point - sort of self-directed learning. The town that we live in here in Southern California has a great unschool program. The students are effectively homeschooled, but then they can go to this unschool. It's actually in an old school. This husband and wife couple bought this old school that the town wasn't using anymore and removed all the desks. Effectively it's like going to a school place, but there is no school.

**ISAAC:** It sounds kind of like Sudbury Valley School. I don't know if you're familiar with that, but that started a long time ago in New England. Very similar - they have a building, they have grounds, they have different resources and materials. But the kids - there's some chaperones - the kids basically do whatever they want. They're self-guided more or less. They have a place to go, they can be around other kids for parents who aren't able to stay home with them. But there's no structured curriculum. They sort of set the tone themselves and the adults are there to help them out with whatever they want help with.

---

## 13:04 "Lord of the Flies, But With Adults on the Island"

**JOSHUA:** I often describe it as Lord of the Flies, but with a couple adults on the island. It turns out that had there been some adults on the island - they put up the guardrails.

I think my number one job as a parent is to not screw my daughter up. I know that's really vague and nebulous, but it's a heuristic by which I ask: okay, is this going to screw her up? And if so, how much? It doesn't mean she's going to skin her leg and she's going to have ouchies here and there. But when she was two years old, I didn't let her play in traffic because she needed to have some sort of boundaries that she was not yet cognitively able to form on her own.

A good unschool program does that. This place has no teachers, but there are mentors there - adults that can help. There's a recording studio there. There are band instruments. There's an art room. There's a bug room. There are gardens - she learns how to garden and farm. There are musicals. It really is self-directed. She's doing filmmaking right now just because it's something that she's interested in trying out.

Of course there's the at-home stuff that she has to do with reading and writing and math. Not a whole lot of that gets done in that environment, although there are opportunities for it. But I find that with self-directed learning, she's able to delight herself in a way that she was never delighted by the public school system. There are a ton of upsides. I haven't seen much in way of downsides yet for her specifically.

## 15:25 The Only Place We Segregate by Age

**JOSHUA:** The place that she goes is pre-K through 12th grade. There aren't many high school students there though.

School is an interesting thing. It's the only place that I'm aware of that we segregate based on age. If you were to go to a corporate job and you're working in a cubicle on the 17th floor at XYZ corporation, and you're 26 years old and you start today - they're not going to put you in the section with all the 26-year-olds and say "next year you'll be over there with the 27-year-olds." You would look at them like they're insane. Yet we've just accepted it as perfectly normal.

I understand kids are in different stages of development, but why not then intermingle them with other kids? Ella's 12. She's been going there since she was seven, so five plus years. She is with six-year-olds and 16-year-olds and they're all in the same room. She's teaching the six-year-old stuff and she's learning from the 16-year-olds. And by the way, she's also learning from the six-year-olds.

You know, you're a parent, you've got four kids, right Isaac?

**ISAAC:** Yeah.

**JOSHUA:** There's an old adage that the teacher ends up learning more than the student. I would say that is true about parenting as well. If parenting is done well, I end up learning more from my daughter about patience and wonder and awe and curiosity than she learns about the rules for living from me.

---

## 16:34 The Apophatic Approach: What NOT to Do

**ISAAC:** You said something - I love this. I'm kind of ripping off a word from theology. The apophatic approach to parenting is what I call it, or to education. Rather than asking what is good parenting or what is a good education, just flipping that around and saying: what is not bad? How do I not do poorly?

I always tell young people with their career: don't do stuff you hate. You don't know what you love yet. As long as you don't do stuff that sucks your soul and keep moving forward, you'll keep adding to the list of things you hate until you end up somewhere you love.

With parenting, with education, it's really stressful to be like, "What's the perfect approach? What do I need to do well and do right?" And I love that you just said: how do I not screw up my child's life? How do I not make the big errors? Put that list over there of things that are not working well, things that don't seem to be getting right outcomes, that seem to be causing problems - and don't do those things.

But then everything else - I think it's really hard. Parents get really panicked. You know this from your own experience and from talking to other parents. If everything seems okay, nothing terrible is happening, but like - what if they're behind? What if they're not where they're supposed to be? What if something horrible - are they supposed to be doing something that I haven't even thought of? Should I be teaching them to code? I heard somewhere that coding is the future.

How do you recommend for yourself and others combating that sense of panic that can jump in that says, "Yeah, my kid seems happy and I think they're learning and nothing horrible is happening. But is there something I'm missing out on that someday I'm gonna realize, oh my gosh, I screwed up by not teaching them this"? How do you combat that panic?

---

## 18:21 "There Are No Shoulds, Only Coulds"

**JOSHUA:** There are no shoulds, there are only coulds. Should my daughter be enrolled in a sport? Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus at some point? No, there are no shoulds with respect to education. There are only coulds.

She can do any of those things. The question is, is she compelled by any of them? And if so, her likelihood for success is so much higher. The question then is: what are you compelled by?

I know the answer is often, "I don't know. I don't know what's interesting." I'm sure you do. You just can't intellectualize it in the moment. But you know it when you sit there, when you do it and you look up at the clock and it's way later than you thought because time was just dripping by so quickly.

All of a sudden it went from a subtle drip, drip, drip when she's in the classroom trying to read and being forced to raise her hand. And then all of a sudden the time is just soaking the table because there's so much immersion when you're interested in something.

We've all had that experience. Time does really strange things to us. Where you're in a classroom and you just keep looking up at the clock. Is this over? It feels like the clock is going backwards. It's just not moving. And there are other times where it's just like, wow, that was already two hours. I can't believe it. Yet it's the same unit of measurement. The only thing that's different is I found something that was engaging to me, something that I was compelled by.

Trying to understand what our kids are compelled by is a much better barometer for me than what is compelling according to the dictates of society.

---

## 20:14 Would You Ever Give Your Kids Fentanyl?

**ISAAC:** I'm really curious about screens and technology and how you think about that with your daughter. I know you guys on The Minimalists - you don't do a bunch of stuff. I know you've done social media fasts at various points. I know you're very much aware of the addictive nature and the problems that can come from that.

But then there's also the "I don't want to run away from the world." Here we are doing a podcast. You mentioned a recording studio. Technology is a tool as long as it's a tool and it doesn't become a master.

How do you, or how does the unschool that your daughter is a part of, deal with that? Is it like, "Hey, if you want to play Roblox or Minecraft all day, go for it"? Or is there some kind of strictures or guardrails there?

**JOSHUA:** Would you ever give your kids fentanyl?

**ISAAC:** I love that answer.

**JOSHUA:** See, I thought that too until my daughter had a surgery. She had a surgery on her scalp - she had third degree burns on her scalp when she was one year old. It was a case of negligence at the place that was watching her. She's had to have three surgeries on that now. During that surgery she was given fentanyl, and it makes sense in that context.

I think the same thing is true with screens. TK, Ryan and I just did a TEDx talk called "Scrolling is the New Smoking." It was about our year off of social media and what we learned about it.

---

## 22:04 Pleonexia: Greed for Things That Can Be Counted

**JOSHUA:** In 2023, we had our most successful year ever in terms of reach - success in terms of the things that can be measured. Ancient Greeks had a word for this: pleonexia, which roughly translates to greed for things that can be counted.

**ISAAC:** We're going to have to put that as the word of the week in our newsletter. That's awesome.

**JOSHUA:** We always are thinking about the things that can be counted. What grades did I get? How much money is in the bank account? What is my square footage? What are my accolades? Things that can be counted. That discounts the things that there are no measurements for. I don't have - how many square feet of joy do you have in your life? How many yards of peace have I acquired this year?

I found that when we were really successful on social media, it became a type of consumerism in a way - "How do I get more?" That's the problem with consumerism: more, more, more, more. It's never enough. We always need more of the acquisition, more of the craving.

Consumerism is an ideology that says acquiring more will make me happy or complete. I think it's possible to do that with social media, and it becomes even more addictive. Fentanyl is addictive, but even that has a purpose.

What I've learned - I took a whole year off social media after we reached half a billion people. But that was something we counted. It doesn't really measure anything because most of those are just like eight-tenths of a second. Does that mean anything at all? No, it's just a metric. It doesn't measure the depth, it measures the width.

---

## 24:06 The Entryway Rule for Phones

**JOSHUA:** When I think about screens, I think about them in my own life. There are two things that have helped me.

One is I need to model the behavior for my daughter. We have something called the entryway rule in our home. That's where our phones go. My wife and I - my daughter does not have a phone and she won't have a phone until she's old enough to have one, likely 18, but I'd be willing to talk about it at 16.

We leave our phone at the door. It's the entryway rule. I can still use it like a home phone. I'm not deprived of the thing, but the distractions don't follow me around the house. I'm not distracted on the couch or in the kitchen or in the bedroom. The bedroom is the worst place for a phone.

Because I could tell her not to use screens, but she just hears that. If she sees that we're not using screens and they have a place - I can still go send a text message, I can still go make a phone call if I need to, but I don't need the distractions to follow me around.

Personally I don't use social media on my phone anymore. I do have social media accounts, but I've just found that they're too tempting to have on my phone. We used to have these little interstitial zones - waiting rooms, or you go out for a walk - and you would have the space to think, to ruminate. But now every interstitial zone and every moment is filled with the potential for distraction. The tug. It's not just social media either - it can be text messages. What is disrupting us? Because the things that disrupt us are often clutter. They get in the way.

---

## 25:32 "The Worst Way I've Screwed Up My Daughter"

**JOSHUA:** I will tell you the other thing: putting limits on screen time for my daughter. The worst way I've ever screwed up my daughter is I got her an iPad years ago. It is the most unfortunate thing that I've done, I think.

We've had to find guardrails for that that are appropriate. Certain things need to be done before she can watch it. There are parental controls on it. We don't allow her to watch it for more than an hour after she's done certain things. And of course, if we need to take it away because it's getting in the way of something else, then we will, but we won't do it punitively.

Because I think that could be traumatizing to kids. We don't realize - I don't want to screw my daughter up by giving her an iPad. I don't want to screw her up even more by yanking it out of her hands and making her resent me or resent technology or resent authority just because she has an emotional response to that.

**ISAAC:** That's a really good insight that the cure can sometimes be worse than the error.

Growing up, my mom is amazing, I'm not throwing her under the bus, but she had this tendency - she is very charitable and takes everything in good faith. She always had this feeling like she could have been doing more and better as a parent. So she would listen to some new cassette tape from some person on parenting and suddenly be like, "I've been doing everything wrong. We're making a complete overhaul. Everything's totally different. Everything we've been doing was bad." And eventually we would just laugh. We wouldn't take it seriously because it was too extreme. It was like, "That's it. I heard a podcast. I'm throwing away the iPad."

But I'm with you. I'm the same with my oldest. He's 20. If I'm trying to be as gracious with myself as possible and not be really hard on myself, I say, well, I was only 21 when he was born and 20 years ago none of us realized how addictive this stuff was. Social media had barely been invented.

Each kid has gotten a better version of me as a parent as we've gone with my four kids. My eight-year-old - we have a very good system of how and when screens are used and for what purposes. And I feel totally at peace about that. With my oldest, I'm like, "Son, I'm sorry."

And by the way, at age 20, he has a flip phone. He switched to a flip phone on his own because he was like, "I cannot control myself if I have an iPhone. I like YouTube videos, I like podcasts, and I just get sucked down. I tell myself it's productive, but I've tried everything else. None of it works. I need a phone, I need texts and phone calls, and it has GPS as well." He just got himself a flip phone.

Anyway, part of me is like, I wish you were at a spot where you didn't feel like that was the only option, but I think I didn't do a good enough job when he was young. And that's a struggle for him.

**JOSHUA:** I think it's something that we all struggle with - understanding how do we incorporate these technologies into our lives as adults, but then how do we incorporate them into the kid's life. Not "how" in terms of what's the prescription, but let me understand how this is helping and how it's harming.

The truth is that unfettered - look up "iPad kids" on YouTube, just type in "iPad kids" and the meltdowns. Because we use these phones as pacifiers. We use our screens as pacifiers. I understand why we do it. I also have that tug to, hey, I'd love to just have some downtime and not have to engage every moment. And so here's a screen - it's really a smoke screen between me and my child.

## 29:57 Minimalism Meets Education: The Full Framework

**ISAAC:** It's a huge challenge. It's funny - it's one of the number one things that all parents are facing. To me, I'm really optimistic and positive because it is so well known now that this is a struggle. And the answer is not burn technology to the ground. It's that this is really immature. All of a sudden we received a handgun when we were toddlers. Now we got to figure out when and where - how do we grow into our use of it?

Let's wrap it up with a little - give me minimalism and education. We've touched on this in a handful of ways, but if you were to summarize how the philosophy of minimalism applies to education.

I'm particularly thinking of a lot of parents who listen to this, who are feeling, especially when kids get to middle school and high school, like their lives are the opposite of minimalist. They're like, "Okay, they want to do sports, they want to do this, I want to do this curriculum, I'm trying to make sure that they can do this, I'm trying to get them ready to go into college" - and it's just more, more, more, more, more. All good intentions. It's not necessarily more in the sense of buying a bunch of toys I don't need, but there's no end to the amount of driving I'm doing, signing up for things, kids schedules, kids homework.

How does minimalism help as a starting point for people to get free from that hedonic treadmill in the education space?

---

## 31:00 Why Competition Is a Mental Illness

**JOSHUA:** It's highly competitive. But I think that type of competition is a mental illness. I know that's not popular to say. I mean it literally - I don't mean that it's bad. I have OCD, that's a mental illness. It's a label. It's not an identity. But competition like that is a mental illness, the striving.

It's like I'm signing a contract with myself to be discontented until I get the thing that I want. And that thing can be graduating from a prestigious kindergarten, or it could be going to the "right" college that I "should" go to, or it can be honors, it can be valedictorian.

The problem with that is that's another type of consumerism. It makes you think that happiness is out there and it can be acquired. We do that with our objects. You buy the new BMW - I don't think there's anything wrong with a BMW. I also know that it's not going to make you happy. If you buy it, you feel that rush of what you mistake for happiness. It's pleasure. But that pleasure is fleeting, necessarily fleeting. And of course, then you feel the discontent when that first of 83 car payments shows up in the mail and it's like, no, what did I do?

It's because I was competing in a way. I was trying to look impressive, sound impressive, be impressive. I was trying to impress people I've never even met and probably won't ever meet.

I recognize that at this point. I don't want my daughter to compete in that way. Now there's friendly, fun competition too - we're dribbling a basketball in the backyard. That's a different thing. That's playful. But as soon as your happiness is tied to an outcome, you lose the happiness that's in the present moment.

---

## 33:20 Joy Cannot Be Acquired - Only Uncovered

**JOSHUA:** How does that tie back into minimalism? You realize with minimalism the joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered. It's buried beneath the clutter.

In our physical lives, in our physical homes, that's often real tangible physical clutter. But our material possessions are merely a physical manifestation of what's going on inside us. So I have a lot of clutter out there, I probably have a lot of clutter in here.

I apply that to education the same way. What is getting in the way? What is clutter? For my daughter, the public school system was a type of clutter. Standardized testing was a type of clutter. It was getting in the way of her life, of her joy, of her peace.

It doesn't mean that she shouldn't do things that are challenging. In fact, she does things that are more challenging now than ever before. It means that struggle does not need to be the beacon for success.

**ISAAC:** Yeah, the more you suffer, the better it is for you - not necessarily the case. I talk about this all the time too. I always say, as I mentioned before, don't do stuff you hate. But hate is not the same as hard. I'm not saying don't do stuff that's hard.

You see kids working on a Lego set or trying to beat a level in a video game and it's hard, but they're having a blast. They love it. It's a meaningful kind of challenge.

## 34:37 Where to Start: Documentaries for Kids

**ISAAC:** Final question for you. If parents want to - not just for themselves, I know for themselves you guys have all kinds of books, resources - if they want to introduce their kids to the concept of minimalism, where's the best place to start? You have a children's book coming out?

**JOSHUA:** TK wrote one. We've been trying to get it published. It's really great.

The best place to start - I know this from sort of the empirical evidence. When Ryan and I first started The Minimalists before TK came along, we would go out on book tour. We'd written some books and we'd often have parents in their thirties and forties or even fifties - and they'd bring one of their kids with them, an 11-year-old or 15-year-old, sort of drag their kids out and say, "You kids need to hear about this."

But then when our first documentary hit Netflix, all of a sudden our tour stops, our live events - it was a bunch of teenagers who were dragging their parents in and saying, "Hey mom and dad, you've got a lot of stuff. You need to see what these guys are talking about."

We have a documentary on Netflix right now called *The Minimalists: Less Is Now*. And then our first documentary - we got the rights back from Netflix a couple of years ago, we put it up on YouTube - it's called *Minimalism*. I think either one of those are a great entry point into our work.

**ISAAC:** That's awesome. I would have been one of those kids. My mom had way too much stuff. I would have been trying to make her watch that Netflix documentary as a teenager for sure.

Joshua Fields Millburn, the minimalist himself. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast and sharing a little bit of your story.

**JOSHUA:** It's my pleasure. Thanks, Isaac.
