## CLIP 1: Wonder Wall

**On-screen text options:**
1. "A $2 curiosity system" — *Counter-Intuitive (cheap = effective)*
2. "Stop answering your kid's questions" — *Polarizing*
3. "Why do sharks have teeth? Do slugs have guts?" — *Curiosity Gap / Humor*
4. "The sticky note hack every homeschool mom needs" — *Direct Value*

**Recommended:** Option 2 for short-form (scroll-stopper), Option 1 for LinkedIn (practical angle)

**Caption (Short-form):**
Stop answering your kids' questions. Seriously.

Krisy uses a $2 "Wonder Wall" — sticky notes on the wall. When her kids ask "why do slugs have guts?" she writes it down. Question validated. Mom not interrupted.

Later, they pick one off the wall and research it together.

Curiosity preserved. Sanity intact.

#Homeschool #HomeschoolMom #CuriosityDriven #OpenEducation

**Caption (LinkedIn):**
Her kids ask "why" a million times a day. Always at the worst possible moment.

So she stopped answering.

Instead, she writes the question on a sticky note and puts it on what she calls the "Wonder Wall."

Later—usually after morning meeting—they pick one off the wall and research it together. Draw pictures. Go deep.

Recent questions: "Why do sharks have teeth?" and "Do slugs have guts?"

$2 in sticky notes. Curiosity validated. Mom's sanity preserved.

Sometimes the simplest systems work best.

## CLIP 2: Vegetables in Learning

**On-screen text options:**
1. "They didn't know it was math" — *Counter-Intuitive*
2. "Hide the vegetables" — *Curiosity Gap*
3. "Stop calling it 'learning time'" — *Polarizing / Direct Challenge*
4. "The Prodigy trick that worked for 3 years" — *Specificity*

**Recommended:** Option 1 for all platforms (strong hook, passes McDonald's test)

**Caption (Short-form):**
Her kids played Prodigy for 3 years thinking it was just a video game.

They had no idea they were doing math.

"It's like hiding vegetables in food. You don't need to tell them the veggies are in there."

#Homeschool #MathGames #Prodigy #ParentingHacks

**Caption (LinkedIn):**
For three years, her kids thought Prodigy was a video game.

A special privilege. Extra screen time. They'd FaceTime cousins and play together for hours.

They had no idea they were solving math equations.

"We never framed it as a math thing. We'd just say, 'Hey, do you wanna play Prodigy?'"

She calls it "hiding the vegetables."

Some learning doesn't need to look like learning.

## CLIP 3: Be the Villager

**On-screen text options:**
1. "Where's the village?" — *Curiosity Gap*
2. "Be the villager" — *Direct / Memorable Quote*
3. "She just picked a park and sent an email" — *Simplicity / Counter-Intuitive*
4. "How to build your homeschool community from scratch" — *Direct Value*

**Recommended:** Option 2 for short-form (sticky quote), Option 3 for LinkedIn (action-oriented)

**Caption (Short-form):**
"It takes a village to raise a kid."

But where's the village?

She heard a quote that changed everything: "If you want to be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager."

So she picked a park. Sent an email. Same time every week.

That's it. That's the whole system.

#Homeschool #HomeschoolCommunity #Village #Parenting

**Caption (LinkedIn):**
Everyone says "it takes a village."

But then we sit around wondering where the village is.

Krisy heard a quote that stuck: "If you want to be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager."

So during COVID, she tried something simple:
→ Picked a random park
→ Sent an email to a few families
→ Same day and time every week

They did it year-round. Winter: moms bundled up with hand warmers, trying not to freeze. Summer: sweating. The kids ran around regardless.

It didn't cost anything. It didn't take special skills. Just willingness to be the one who sends the email.

## CLIP 4: Trust Yourself

**On-screen text options:**
1. "They'll never love your kid like you do" — *Emotional / Polarizing*
2. "Trust yourself" — *Direct / Permission*
3. "The doubts are normal" — *Validation*
4. "Who knows your kid better than you?" — *Rhetorical / Empowering*

**Recommended:** Option 1 for short-form (emotional hook), Option 4 for LinkedIn

**Caption (Short-form):**
The teacher might be amazing.

They might love your kid.

But they're never going to love your kid the way you do.

Trust yourself. The doubts are normal. You're doing the best you can with what you have.

That's enough. Because they're your kid.

#Homeschool #HomeschoolMom #Parenting #TrustYourself

**Caption (LinkedIn):**
"Who is more invested in your kid than you? Who knows your kid better?"

Krisy still doubts herself after years of homeschooling.

But here's what she tells new parents:

The teacher might be amazing. They might love your kid. But they'll never love your kid the way you do.

You're doing the best you can with what you have.

That's enough.

## CLIP 5: Cocoa Club

**On-screen text options:**
1. "Food makes conversation easier" — *Insight*
2. "Cocoa Club" — *Curiosity Gap / Charming*
3. "Friday poetry + hot chocolate" — *Specific / Aspirational*
4. "Why we ditched 'tea time'" — *Slight Rebellion*

**Recommended:** Option 3 for short-form (paints a picture), Option 1 for LinkedIn (insight-forward)

**Caption (Short-form):**
Every Friday: hot chocolate and poetry.

They call it Cocoa Club.

(They tried "poetry tea time" but a friend with all boys said her kids wanted nothing to do with "tea time." Hot chocolate it is.)

There's something about gathering around food. Silence isn't awkward when you have a cup to sip.

## CLIP 6: Day in the Life Supercut

**On-screen text options:**
1. "A week in our homeschool" — *Descriptive*
2. "This is what homeschool actually looks like" — *Reality Check*
3. "No two days look the same" — *Counter to Expectation*
4. "Our version of 'school'" — *Reframe*
5. "From couch zoning to poetry club" — *Range / Journey*

**Recommended:** Option 2 for TikTok/Reels (reality angle resonates), Option 3 for YouTube

**Caption (Short-form):**
This is what homeschool actually looks like:

☕ 10 AM start (soccer practice runs late)
📝 Morning meeting: scriptures, news, journals
🦈 "Do slugs have guts?" on the Wonder Wall
🚗 45-minute drive to co-op (worth it)
☕ Friday = Cocoa Club + poetry
❄️ Moms freezing at Nature School while kids run around

Different every day. That's the point.

## OUTSIDE-THE-BOX IDEAS

### 1. "Questions on Our Wonder Wall" Series
Weekly post featuring a real question from a homeschool kid's Wonder Wall. Crowdsource from your audience.

Post format: The question + "What would YOU research first?"

Builds community. Endless content. Zero production cost.

---

### 2. "Hiding the Vegetables" Challenge
Ask parents to share how they've hidden learning in play/games without their kids knowing.

UGC goldmine. Creates a hashtag moment. #HidingTheVegetables

---

### 3. Audio Snippet as Background for B-Roll
Take the "be the villager" quote (10 seconds of audio) and layer over:
- Stock footage of moms at a park
- Kids running around
- Simple community gathering

No talking head needed. Just audio + visuals + text overlay. Different format, same content.

---

### 4. "What I'd Tell a New Homeschool Parent" Mini-Series
Cut the "Trust Yourself" clip into 3 micro-clips:
1. "The doubts are normal" (5 sec)
2. "Who knows your kid better than you?" (5 sec)
3. "They'll never love your kid like you do" (8 sec)

Post separately across 3 days. Each stands alone. Together they're a campaign.

---

### 5. Podcast Audiogram with Waveform
Old school but effective for podcast promotion:
- Best 30-second audio clip
- Waveform animation
- Quote text overlay
- "Full episode" CTA

Works on all platforms. Low effort, high clarity.
