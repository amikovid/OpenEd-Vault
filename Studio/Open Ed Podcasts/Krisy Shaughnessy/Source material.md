From Krisy: 

Today’s chat was fun! Thanks again for having me on the show.

You mentioned it will get edited into a written article, so I wanted to send you a few photos you’re welcome to use (and also totally fine if you don’t!)

First are books that I love having on hand. Families can get them from the library, I personally just bought a bunch because we use them often. They have tons of visuals and facts, so when my kids are zoning out during their time to explore, they often like to grab one of these and flip through until something sparks an interest.

Next are a couple pages from my daughter’s Wonder Book notebook.

And last is our Wonderwall. (I currently have transparent sticky notes, which feel really fun!)

Lastly, I hope my message today didn’t come across like I have all the answers! I don’t, and I have spent hours upon hours stressing and crying and worrying if I’m doing this whole alternative education right. It’s daunting, but it’s also incredible and has been the greatest thing our family has done together. So feel free to edit anything that you feel needs to be taken out!

Thanks!

[00:00:00]

**Ela Bass:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella, and today I'm joined by Chrissy Shaughnessy. Chrissy is a parent who is in open ed, and today we're gonna get into her backstory, why she decided to homeschool and what homeschool looks like for her family today. So first, welcome to the podcast.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Thank you. I'm so excited to be here. Thanks for

**Ela Bass:** I love it. Um, okay, so first question that is always so interesting to ask, did you mean to homeschool or was this something that you planned?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Absolutely not. I love that you start right off with that. But, um, we had never really considered homeschooling. We started, when the pandemic shut the world down and my kids were, I had a kindergartner and a first grader and so we pulled them out. 'cause online learning ?Was not fun to try to navigate with two kids who wanted to be running around and playing instead of being on an iPad.

And so. Yeah, that's what threw us into homeschooling and we've loved it more than we thought we would.

**Ela Bass:** That's amazing. So what did homeschool look like for you in the beginning? So you had gotten to this point where you were like, okay, well they [00:01:00] obviously are just sitting on screens all day, and that's not what I want for them. let me see what I can do for them instead. What did that look like for you?

Were you like googling how to homeschool, and then where did you begin in.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Okay, great questions. Um, so luckily for me, I have a cousin who had started homeschooling a few years before the pandemic. So I had talked to her quite a bit and I kind of had some ideas. So when we decided it was time, she was my instant lifeline and I'm so grateful to have had someone who kind of like guided and mentored me through it.

and so for anybody who's considering homeschooling, please just find your nearest local homeschool friend, and I'm sure they'd be more than happy to hold your hand through it. but for us it really. I shouldn't get much credit for how it all fell through, because when the world shut down, we had just bought a house.

We put an offer in in February, 2020 when everything looked normal. And then March, 2020 hit and we all know what happened there. And so by the time that we pulled my kids out of school, it was because we had already moved to a different, school boundary and we were like, oh, it's fine. Like we will just.[00:02:00]

Take them and they wouldn't go back to the original school they had been in. So it was a really easy decision to make when we thought it was just gonna be a few weeks that they were outta school. And then it ended up here in Oregon. It ended up being over a year. And so I was so grateful that we had made that decision because kids were doing online learning for over a year, and my kids were just having fun.

And so, like I said, we had just bought a house and there were a bunch of. Fixer up projects to do. So the first several months of our homeschooling actually looked like working on house projects together and just playing games, spending time together. And it was amazing for me to see how much learning could happen in everyday stuff.

And so as we were fixing things, they would help me to calculate or measure or things that would help to quantify the things that we were, Working on at our house. And so it all just came really naturally and organically, and that's part of what sold me on it was, oh, they're doing [00:03:00] great without a workbook,

**Ela Bass:** That's amazing. So I wanna get a little bit into how you homeschool. I wanna go more into your story a little bit later, but just to dive into the things that I know a lot of families love to hear each other's, day in the lives. They love to hear what resources they're using, what things have really started working for their family.

Because the hardest part about homeschool is like you could actually do it and. So many different ways. and also that different kids need different things often. So just having a, like a mental conception of what you could possibly do, like that is something that's so helpful for a lot of families. So, what does homeschool look like for y'all today?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** That's another great question. so we probably would say that we fall more in the unschooling camp than anything. I tend to. Um, get really bored with routines. If it's really rigid, it's, it's hard and tedious for me to stick with. And as the one who's guiding the, the rhythm of our homeschool, that that needs to work for me.

And so, even though I say we unschool, it's still very [00:04:00] intentional. I know what the state standards are for the ages that my kids are in, and we just kind of look for what would be fun to go along with that. So, our main backbone of our. Philosophy of homeschooling is, mentoring from the classics.

So we do read a lot of books and that's kind of the main core framework, but then. The other things that we do. So we like to have our slow starts in the morning. my kids both play soccer and they have practices almost every night until pretty late. And that is something I've been so grateful for that as they're getting older and older and their practices are getting later and later, they're able to sleep in and take care of the things that they need to.

So realistically, most days we're not fully going until about 10:00 AM. Before that, they're just kind of starting out slow, reading some books, doing what they want to, and then we do chores around 10:00 AM we sit down and we do what we call our morning meeting. And that is, we read some scriptures together and we watch a news program that we, that I do online.

It's about a 10 minute little. Clip each day. That highlights what's going on in the world. and then we do journal writing, which we have a few different [00:05:00] journals. One is, like a vocabulary word of the day that my kids think is really fun. Another is a prompted journal that I got off of Amazon that asks them a question in each day.

They'll fill that out. there's a couple others that they have, and so they'll pull one of their journals out, they can choose which one they wanna do. Um, and that's kind of our core start to the morning. And then after that. They break out their math curriculum, which for us math curriculum is something we started last year.

Before that we didn't use any curriculum. And then, after they finish their math, they kind of are just turned loose to do whatever they are interested in. And normally by the time we've gotten that morning meeting and the math done, their minds are kind of warmed up and excited and then it's amazing to see what they'll go.

Tackle and, and find. so that's what our structure looks like. And so, like I said, that's very loosey goosey if, if people are looking for something with, with more routine. but I've found that their, what they choose to do for their exploration time is, is really great. And realistically, that's also [00:06:00] just our Monday and Tuesday.

Um, we have a co-op that we go to on Wednesday, so. That takes up most of our Wednesday, we drive about 45 minutes for our co-op because we found one that we really love and it's been worth that drive. So by the time we go up there, go to classes, and then stay and hang out with friends, it really is an all day thing on Wednesday and then on Thursday.

Families from that co-op have started some like individual clubs and things like that. And so one mom is amazing. She was like, my kid doesn't really like writing, so, but he really likes friends. So if I have all your kids come over once a month and give them a writing challenge, Would you guys be interested?

And so she teaches a writing class. We just call it writing club once a month. another family was like, my kid loves reading. Let's do a book club. So that's another Thursday. So our Thursdays are filled with what we just call random clubs. And it's just something that friends have thrown together and it works out great for us.

And then Fridays, there is a friend that we have who their dad is a retired history teacher. And so he started teaching, a history class to our kids, and then we [00:07:00] all just stay and play at the park and we call it nature school so that they're learning something while they run around. So that's really what our week looks like.

It's different every day and that helps to keep it really exciting and fun for us.

**Ela Bass:** I love this and I, I mean, you mentioned that, that it's not that much structure, but I actually think it's like, it's just the right amount of structure. Like at least for me it would be 'cause you have things that you're consistently doing, and you also have like loose structure. It's like, okay, well in the morning we know we're gonna touch on these few things and these are the best things to get us.

But then you also have freedom inside of there. So like the example of, giving them that exploration time. Are your kids really good at using the exploration time? I feel like a lot of parents talk about the fact that, you know, they try and give their kids freedom and then they turn around and their kids on the iPad and it's like, whoa, that's not what I meant.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** That, that's great. yes, actually they are, and I think that is something that works well is the personalities of my kids. They do have screen time things, but most of it is very [00:08:00] educational and maybe that's just something that we were really intentional with at the beginning. That habit has been created, but most of what they'll do on a screen is like my son is getting really into coding, and so he will be programming something.

So yes, he's on a screen, but he will have brainstormed some project and then want to be getting back to that. And so. They do use that time well also, sometimes they are just sitting like on the couch looking like they're totally zoned out and so it might not seem like they're using it well, but when I've talked to them and like checked in with them to see what's going on, they're, they're thinking about things and I think that there's such a value to some boredom.

And so I think yeah, for those parents who are struggling with that, set your boundaries and your rules for sure of. Whatever you don't want your kid getting into, but let them just be bored and it's amazing what their minds will come up with.

**Ela Bass:** What are your boundaries? And you mentioned that you were intentional with screens at the beginning. What did that look like?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** I hadn't even thought about preparing for this. they at the [00:09:00] beginning, so we just have like a central hub that laptops and iPads and stuff we're all plugged into. So they're, they're not in bedrooms, they're not, They really are just in the main area of the house. And at first, at first it was just iPads.

We got the, the i the laptops later. but just the iPads. We just had educational games and I'm grateful that at least the way it works with Apple, you can have like a family account. And so everything was pretty locked down and had to go through my account to get some apps and this was when they were six and seven, and so it was Not too weird for them to not be able to access a lot of things on their own iPads. And so then as they've gotten older, they still just ask and they check in and we've been able to have a lot of great conversations. I guess it's less about rules and more about conversations of like, why do we have limits and why do we, and then when whenever there's a situation that needs a little bit of explanation, they seem to understand.

We're not doing it because we're mean parents, but that it's, I don't know, that makes us sound like we are way more perfect than we are. Like there are definitely hiccups and struggles along the way, but I feel like overall [00:10:00] it's landed at a good rhythm of being able to talk about it and, yeah.

**Ela Bass:** Do you hold yourself to the same central hub? Like do you, that's cool.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** that's minus phones. We have phones in our rooms, but like the computers and stuff are all in the same main areas. And, and even with our phones, my husband and I try to be pretty intentional about like telling them what we're doing on our phones, why we would have it anywhere that we have it. my kids right now are 11 and almost 13, so we are just entering that stage where they're gonna be wanting phones.

And so that's. We've been trying to be a good example of how we use them so that when they eventually get one, it will be easier to explain the rules and the boundaries on that. But this is all hypothetical parenting teens with phones, so we'll see how it goes in real life. Mm-hmm.

**Ela Bass:** You also mentioned that you have taken a very intentional approach of conversation-based parenting. what does that look like from a young age, especially whenever, like they're home all the time, like that is, I, I know that the, [00:11:00] the hardest part about homeschooling is just that, like your mom, your teacher.

For a lot of people it's that like there's no separation. And oftentimes you're doing that with a lot of kids all at once. And so sometimes it's hard to manage, but it sounds like. Y'all have found and created a really, really, really great, rhythm for your family.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Thanks. so the conversations, I am just a very chatty person in the first place, so it came pretty naturally that, and I, I love curiosity. I think from the very beginning when my kids were little. Just exploring curiosity was fun. I've always tried to make it that there are no bad questions, no questions that they need to be embarrassed about or anything like that.

So it keeps it really easy for it to be open. And yeah, like I said, I think maybe more of it is c chalk up to just my personality. My family makes fun of the fact that I kind of don't stop talking. So I think conversational based parenting just came really easily.

**Ela Bass:** That's so cool. And then how have you gotten to the point, you said that your son is pretty interested in coding right now. How have you gotten to the point where like you have, [00:12:00] stirred their curiosity to the, to the extent that like they're now actually pursuing things on their own? 'cause I know, in a lot of conversations that I've had, it's like. Yeah, most parents want their kids to be interested in different topics and like most parents do their best to share all of these new things and try and ignite the curiosity. And part of it is just personality. but part of it is also just like probably the way that you do things. and I was talking to someone yesterday actually who was saying that something that has been really great for her kids' curiosity is just reading a ton.

Is there anything that in your family has helped to like spur and, just move along their curiosity that you see has, you know, instigated in a way this coding interest and all their other interests?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** so we go to the library a ton. Like I said, kind of the core philosophy of our homeschool is that we're being mentored by good books. And so, and with that said, like they still read. Junk books too, but they, we try to have book discussions and things like that. So the books that we find in the books that I [00:13:00] choose to keep on our bookshelf at home are covering a variety of interests.

And like I said, from a young age, that curiosity, if they've shown an interest in anything, it's really easy to check out some books from the library that are age appropriate and as they. As they get bored and sometimes just have that time that they're sitting on the couch zoned out, they'll grab one of those books and, and look through it and see if it captures their interest.

And so, yes, books are a huge part of it. And then also it's one of the reasons I love that we're part of open ed is we have some funding that helps us buy little kits and random things that is. Another thing to have hands on, I think for them to just be able to dive into something and to be able to know that they can't mess it up.

so like when my son wants to take things apart and figure out how, how it works, it's, it's not too hard to be like, okay, yeah, sure you can do that, or Let's buy you some, some wires in a kit that, like, there's a ton of really great things on Amazon for $20 or less in most different interest price points.

And so when they express an interest. [00:14:00] To just kind of go with it and see what happens. and going back to the books thing, the main motivation behind the books is that you're being mentored through someone's story. Like the whatever perspective the book is about, you're learning from that person's perspective.

And so the same thing applies in real life, that if there's a concept that such as, eng or like coding, that. If they want to learn more about that, to find somebody who knows how to do that. And so luckily my dad is a computer programmer, so that was a, an easy one to connect that I had bought him a kit and he didn't know how to use it.

And when my dad came out to visit, he and my son spent like a whole day just setting it up. My dad was teaching him some like basic codes and he knows that if he messes up the code that grandpa helped him start with, then. He can call grandpa and figure out how to like fix it. And so that was about a year ago.

And over the course of this year, he's really just kind of taken off with it. And so once again, I think knowing that if they make a mistake, it's not the end of the world. It's a chance to [00:15:00] learn what didn't work and how to pivot and, and improve.

**Ela Bass:** I love that and I actually think that that's a really great call out that I've never heard before, but finding a role model for your kids in the things that they could possibly be interested in, and oftentimes somebody that they're already, looking up to, like it is a lot easier for your son to get really excited about coding.

When somebody that he loves and is there to help him and like they connect on it, right? can be there with him in doing it. It's like a special thing that they have now. and I've definitely seen that in my own life and in friends' life where it's like you, you start doing the things that the people that you admire most are doing because it's y'all's thing now.

so being able to connect those dots is really amazing.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Thanks.

So the people who homeschool multiple children, I'm so impressed 'cause two is a lot as it is and so, and they're close enough in age, we do a lot together. So just a shout out to all the parents who are homeschooling a wide range of ages and numbers of kids.

**Ela Bass:** Oh yeah.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** just two.

**Ela Bass:** Well, along that thread, how do you [00:16:00] homeschool two kids? I know that, you know, like you just mentioned. It is a lot to homeschool four and five and three, but even two, like two at the same time. Two kids with very different personalities and different interests at times. Like, ha has that been challenging at all?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** it's getting more so as they get older actually. Um. In some ways and then in other ways, no, but they, when they were little, we just did a lot of stuff together because they're, they're one grade apart if they were in traditional school. So, so much of what we can do is really easy to bundle together, and that's where I think the parents who are homeschooling a 15-year-old at the same time as a 5-year-old, do an amazing job if they can bundle anything together.

Whereas to have an 18 month gap, they are pretty able to, to keep up with each other, but as. As they've gotten a little bit older, my daughter is far more interested in artistic pursuits and my son is far more mathematical. And so we've had to start doing those more separately. And that is more of a handful to be at two different levels [00:17:00] in math and two different levels in language arts.

to meet them where they're at. Still with just two. It's not, it's not as hard as, I know some people who have four or five kids and they, they basically rotate through stations of each kid and then have the other kids hang out with younger siblings or older siblings to keep them busy while they focus on one kid.

And so luckily we don't have that problem because the, the starting to spread to me at different levels didn't happen till they've been independent enough that they can do a lot of it on their own. So I don't get too much credit for, for how we're doing that juggle, but it is definitely seeing more of as they're taking off into their own interests, meeting them at their spot rather than being able to kind of batch it together.

**Ela Bass:** Yeah, for sure. Is that something that, that makes you a little nervous? I know that like the younger years are oftentimes a lot easier for, for parents to homeschool in, and then at times it feels a little bit more stressful because like, you know, like complex, I don't know, geometry. [00:18:00] It's like I am not an expert.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Luckily, there are so many resources out there that take a lot of that off my plate and it's, it's been nice to learn how my kids like to learn. And so like for us, online classes, they think are the worst thing ever. Whereas some people that is like their jam. My kids would much rather learn from a book or just.

Try to figure it out. They watch a lot of videos, but they don't want it to be like an interactive Zoom class or something like that. And just learning that little detail has helped so much to know what resources to find. because something like out school, they're not that interested in, but something like Life of Fred Books, I don't know if you've checked those out, but they go through higher grades that it's not like it's just, Boring, basic, I shouldn't say boring or basic, the easier stuff that we all know how to do, like elementary math. And so, but yeah, there are so many resources. And once again, something else that I love about open ed is that they can connect you to so many resources. so I, when we first started, I was definitely far more afraid of the older [00:19:00] ages, but as we've arrived at this point, it's getting easier and easier because.

Partially 'cause my kids are more and more opinionated, so I know what they're looking for. I know what they're wanting, and if it's not working, they'll tell me. and that was something in the earlier years that they kind of just went along with it because they trusted that I knew what I was doing. And now it's been easier and easier to turn it over to them more and more.

And so they're really starting to take charge of their own education. And I'm just here as a. I'll find the right mentors, I'll find the right books and like I'll help you research how we can help you learn that. And like I said, they're middle school age, so I can only imagine how that's gonna just flourish in high school.

So.

**Ela Bass:** That's amazing. How, how did that start? So you mentioned that they obviously got more opinionated over time, but like, were you asking them and were you trying a lot of different types of approaches even whenever they were pretty young? so like the online classes, or was it like you, you saw them on COVID, you're like, Hmm, I don't know if they like that.

How did that go?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** yeah, I. Maybe I just doubt myself way too [00:20:00] much. But I do check in with them a lot of like, do you guys feel like this is working? we constantly have it that the public school will take them back at any time if they wanna go back to regular school. I try not to use that as a, a threat or anything, but as really an option of would you prefer this?

Would you prefer, like we have friends who do several different types of educational options, which has been so fun to see how. Over the last several years, so many options have opened up. But we just basically talk about what everybody else is doing and see do you wanna try something like that. And so, yeah, over the last few years especially we've started, as they've become more independent learners, we've branched out to, do you wanna try this curriculum?

Do you wanna try this out school class? Do you wanna try? And there's things they've loved and things they haven't. And we always just sign up in small batches of something and then they're allowed to. Let me know if it's working and if not, we can pivot. And granted, there are things like, we're using a math curriculum right now and it's working well, and they both agree that it's like making sure they don't have gaps in holes, but they both think it's dreadfully boring and they don't [00:21:00] love using a curriculum, but they see the benefit of it.

So with what I'm saying, it's not like they're gonna find some. Golden thing that is just fun all the time. There's definitely some dissatisfaction as you're learning, and I think we all remember that going through our own learning journeys that sometimes to learn a complex concept or to, improve what we're trying to do, there is a struggle and there is some grittiness that isn't beautiful.

And so to help them realize that that's not necessarily a bad thing, but. If they're not seeing progress, that's the problem. And so, um, for my kids, the biggest issue with the online classes was that there were other kids in the Zoom class and it would go off on tangents. And they get sick of that. Like, they're like, that's not what we're here for.

I think it's so funny that they're 11 and almost 13 and they're like, we're not here for the social time. Okay. Like, who are you children? But anyway,

**Ela Bass:** That is so funny. It, it's, it's also really funny to see like their personalities, it sounds like, come out in all of [00:22:00] these things. you mentioned that there's a difference between something that is challenging and something that's not working as a parent, it's really hard to tell the difference at times.

How have you learned to tell the difference between those two?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** wow. That's an insightful question that, I dunno if I, it's just like you said before, as homeschoolers we're together all the time, so I do feel like I know my kids pretty well and I can tell the difference of. I guess it's more of the day after day, the frustration, the things, the things that aren't relevant to what they're working on.

Like I said, like it's the, the chatter in the online classes that, that is frustrating. It's not the subject matter. And so that helps me to see like, well, is there a way we can cut out the chatter while still keeping the subject? And so that helps you to pivot and kind of see, whereas kids definitely have their ups and downs.

Like I said, they're getting more and more opinionated. They're, they're having. I mean, they're just normal humans. They have their good days and their bad days. And so there are days where the, the math curriculum that we're using that I do feel like is working. They just don't wanna do it. And there's [00:23:00] tears and there's frustration, and you can see those days is just a bad day versus day after day after day of being like, this is frustrating and not working.

So I guess that's kind of how I would differentiate it, is not letting them give up for long enough that you can see if it's a pattern or if it's just. Them being frustrated. cause if you ask them, they'll be like, both of 'em are terrible. I'd rather just be doing what I wanna be doing. And so, but like I said, as you break it down and you can see like the good and the progress that's happening, then that's a little bit easier to, to tell that it's just a frustration and a discomfort through the hard stuff rather than something that's truly not working.

**Ela Bass:** I love that. In your family, how do y'all talk about education? Like what, what is, if you were to ask your kids, I mean, maybe this is a question for them, but like, is coming from you at least, what, what is education for them and, and how has that been defined differently since they're homeschooling?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** That's good. so for us it's just a big focus on the love of learning and of like, are you curious, do you want to find out more about this? sorry to keep like plugging open ed in here, [00:24:00] but that's one of the things I love is that the learning logs that we turn in each week are literally. Three to five sentences of what they learned that week.

And I'm so grateful that it's not, please submit a curriculum page or something like that, because that's what I noticed. So like I said, they went to public school for, my son went for a year and then six months into the COVID year, and my daughter went just for the, the first six months before everything shut down.

And, they had fantastic teachers and. Did not have a bad experience in school, but they would come home and just be like, learning's boring. And because they were being classroom managed, which once again teachers were fantastic and I don't blame them. They were doing what they needed to do to have that many kids with one teacher.

but they, they kind of shut down. And before that, like before when they were in preschool and before, they loved it and were so curious. And then when we pulled them out. Curiosity came back and they were like, oh, what do I wanna learn about? And so we've just focused on that a lot and built off of that, that they can explore anything they [00:25:00] want to.

Education is them learning something and how sitting in a room and being taught. Something doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna retain it, but if you go discover it, you're far more curious and your brain stores it differently than, and so they've just had examples of classes they've sat in and realized, oh yeah, I, I like being able to figure out what I want to on my own.

And so that's kind of the core framework that we have with how we talk about education. And then from there, they're just building it out on their own. They understand what their peers are doing in certain classes, and so they wanna make sure that they're. On track with those, and that's been a great motivator for them to pick up subjects they might not have chosen and otherwise they're, yeah, just diving in on their own.

**Ela Bass:** That's amazing. Yeah. That is so amazing. you mentioned that you ask them consistently and that they have this very strong sense of what do I want to learn about? How often do you ask that question and when did you start asking that question? I.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** we've really kind of asked it [00:26:00] all the way through just so that I could know what I was like going back to the very beginning of our podcast episode. I never planned on homeschooling, so I've been learning this side by side along with them. And so I've liked to kind of let them be an equal partner in what we're, what we're focusing on, because I know there's so many different ways that homeschoolers Can go. Some people are very tech savvy, others are all in on Charlotte Mason, artistic, beautiful, appreciating classic art and literature. And so there's just very different types of homeschooling and I didn't know, like I said, my daughter's very artistic, my son's very science, math minded. And so just on their own they would be two very different homeschooled type children.

And so to, to keep asking them and finding out what they're enjoying has just always come pretty. Naturally to make sure that I felt like I was doing my job well. And so, how often we ask them, I don't, there's not really like a set time. It kind of seems like when they start getting bored more. and so if I have stuff that they're [00:27:00] interested in, it's pretty easy to tell that they're fine.

And so sometimes I'll ask it. Every couple of weeks, like, what do you guys wanna learn about what should we be doing? And a lot of what we do kind of ends up being like unit studies where it's for short term and maybe they'll get really excited about animals. And so we'll study a lot about. Different animals and then suddenly it's, we're onto coding and building some little robot.

And so it's very, very eclectic, but it kind of just goes with when they're bored of something or when they've seen something new that they want to try. that's kind of when the question pops up of, well, how can I help you do that? And what should we, but like I said, I have middle schoolers, so it is a lot easier to do that now than if they were back to being.

Kindergarten, first graders where they're like, I don't know, I just wanna eat cookies all day.

**Ela Bass:** When they were really young, what did you do? Like, how did you decide what they were learning and like obviously you didn't have the same feedback and you, you mentioned that there was a part of you that questioned a lot. Esp I mean part of it's 'cause you're just starting your homeschool [00:28:00] journey and also they can't tell you their feedback as well, but.

What did you do then? And like, did you lean on your friends a lot and, uh, how did you decide like how to evolve it over time?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Yes. So I should definitely say that I've leaned on friends a lot all the way through. there, there are so many great ideas that other people do. For example, we have something that we call Cocoa Club, and it's on Friday mornings. It's every Friday we make a nice big cup of hot chocolate and we read poetry.

I know some people have called it poetry tea time, but we had a friend who has all boys and they're like. My kids do not want to have tea time. It's not a tea party. So we pivoted to hot chocolate and I was like, oh, that's a great idea. Like I think my kids would love that more than, than a tea time.

And so, we've been doing that for years and it's, we'll either pull out poetry books or we just do something called free writing where they have a prompt and they just write whatever they can think for a certain amount of time and then we see what we find. and so that was all an idea that came from someone else.

We've been able to grow with that as they've gotten older, when they were really little and we very first started out. like I said, I've [00:29:00] always looked up the common Core standards, like you can find those anywhere online. And so I knew what needed to be hit throughout the year and we just would find ways to do it.

And luckily in those beginning years, they, they give you a lot of time for some really core principles like. Edition is pretty much for a whole school year and subtraction and like it's, it's not like it's these big, I feel like we've hit the middle school stage where it's kind of like trying to incorporate everything and add some new things.

And it feels like there's a whole lot more on that checklist. But those early years, it's stuff that feels manageable. It's stuff that I knew how to do and then we just found ways to play with it. Like getting a set of dice or playing cards. You can make so many math games just out of a simple tool like that.

Um, like you roll dice and you just see who can get to something that would add up to six or, how many sixes would it take to get to 36? And, um, just making it fun and they think it's a game, but they're learning the core concepts. my kids learned fractions from eating [00:30:00] cookies. When you say, what's half of a cookie?

How many halves make one? And if they're eating cookies, they're more than happy to be doing fractions. Um, and so it was just things like that that came really naturally. 'cause it was stuff that we were gonna do anyway. And we just, because I knew the common core standards that needed to be hit, I just looked for ways that it incorporated into what we were already doing in our day.

so that's more of what, what said it that way, because I had noticed that. Their eyes would glaze over and that lack of a love of learning. When we would pivot and be too scholastic, for lack of a better word, it was far more meaningful for them if we incorporated it in ways that made it fun.

**Ela Bass:** I, I absolutely love that. And I think, I think that's part of the beauty of homeschool is that you can do that. Like you mentioned this before, but I think it, it's, it's honestly one of the core things about homeschool. It's that. Regular school has to solve learning for a lot of people all at [00:31:00] once, and that's really, really hard.

and in homeschool you get the opportunity to solve learning for a very small group of people usually, and like. Yeah. And I think that you, your examples are very amazing for like how fractions can be fun or like how addition can be fun. and yeah, I, I love that you did that. How did you find all of those different ideas?

Were you like looking 'em up online? Were friends telling you about them?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Once again, mostly friends, but there are tons of blogs of, of people who share their same kind of thing. So if you don't have a, a core group of friends, That are homeschooling, then you can, you can definitely find ideas online. It just takes knowing what questions to ask. And so Google's great if you say how to make edition fun and, which is something I had never even thought of googling before, homeschooling a first and second grader.

And so it's, it's stuff that you might not have thought, but it's a lot easier to do than you're probably thinking off the bat.

**Ela Bass:** Yeah. I love that. And along the [00:32:00] lines of m making homeschool fun and also the the value of homeschool, what do you and your husband love most about this experience of homeschooling?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** probably just the time that we get to spend with our kids. It feels almost like we're cheating the system somehow by getting to spend so many extra hours with our kids. like I mentioned before, my kids have pretty intense soccer schedules. They play on a competitive level, and so they're, they're doing a lot of soccer and.

We've thought so many times of if they were gone all day and getting home, doing homework and then sending 'em off to practice, we really wouldn't have the quality family time that we do. And so that has been kind of our driving force behind it, is making sure that that relationship is positive, is more important to us than anything else that is going on academically because there's so many resources that the kids could find a way to get caught up academically they're doing fine, but that the relationship and the connection is, is the priority and everything else seems to just [00:33:00] work out as, as we focused on that.

**Ela Bass:** That's amazing. I absolutely love that. I have a few other questions for you. One of them is, just like a, a fun one, but are there resources that you would recommend, I, I know that you do open ed, are there resources inside of open ed and also outside that you found that your, your family loves?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** yeah, so. Math wise, especially when my kids were younger, they loved Prodigy. so I don't know if, if people are, are aware of Prodigy, but it's a great way to gamify math and they would do that quite a bit. there was something that Open Ed had, I don't even know if they still have it. My kids haven't played it for a while, but I think it was like Legends of Learning or something like that.

But it's similar to Prodigy and so they were grateful we got that one through open ed. the first one we had found on our own, Those made it really fun and they, at the ages that they were really into it, they thought they were playing video games, which it kind of is like it's gamified, but they, it was fun that they thought it was like this privilege that they were getting extra screen time and they didn't realize that they were just solving math equations.

**Ela Bass:** How did you introduce that out of curiosity? That like, they literally [00:34:00] felt like it was a game as opposed to, because I, I would guess that most families would be like, Hey, here's a math game, and kids would still like it, but the fact that they were like, oh my gosh. Like we're, we're, we're playing a game,

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** I think it helped that they have some cousins who started playing it around the same time, so it would be like a FaceTime call while they all played and they would find each other in the same world. And so. They were like doing the math to be able to get to the stuff that they needed to. So we never really framed it as a math thing.

We kind of did just say like, Hey, do you wanna play Prodigy? And by never saying, oh, you need to do your prodigy so you can get some extra math time in. That was something we didn't really mention and not to be like sketchy or something. It's kind of like when you put vegetables in food, like there's some veggies you can blend up that's totally unnoticeable.

You don't need to tell them that the veggies are in there. You just know that they're getting the veggies. And so, it was kind of like that, where it was just how we worded it and I think they just thought it was a special privilege.

**Ela Bass:** I love that. And I, I think the fact that like if you can find [00:35:00] something that other people, that they actually back to the whole thing with your, with your dad or their his grandpa, like if you can find people that they enjoy being around that can help to influence them in the right direction, like that is a way to hack it.

Like there's gonna be no kid that's like, oh no, I don't wanna play with my cousins unless they don't like 'em, I guess. But, um.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** true.

**Ela Bass:** But like, no kid's gonna be like, no, I don't wanna do that. Right. And like it honestly, like my, my little brothers and like my little cousins, like they all will get on games and play with each other.

But like, isn't it so fun that you could actually do that for a math game?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Yeah. Um, a second resource I was gonna tell you about is we call it the Wonder Wall. And so all that it takes cost-wise is a pack of sticky notes and a designated space. And so we had an old, whiteboard that we covered with. It's like, that's press and seal or, peel and stick. That's what it's called, wallpaper.

So it looks cute and it's fine hanging up on the wall, but they, whenever they have a question, 'cause as a mom you get asked why this, how does this work a million times a day? And there's something about it that it's always at the least convenient time [00:36:00] possible to actually answer that question. And so what we would do is we put on a sticky note and, So that their question was validated, but I didn't have to answer it right then. And then during our homeschool time, a lot of times it'd be right after we finished our morning meeting, we'd be like, well, do you guys wanna explore one of your wonderwall questions? And so they'd go pick one off the wall, we'd grab a notebook and we'd research it.

We'd draw pictures about it, and it was a great way to dive into the stuff they were curious about while also not having to be asked, asked why a million times a day? And so. So that's another one that's been really fun and we still even do it as my kids have gotten older. my son, he's my older one, he rolls his eyes a little bit about it still, but my daughter still loves doing it.

And so it's a fun way to, to explore curiosity and go down those really weird rabbit trails. Like some of 'em were like, why do sh or do sharks have teeth? And, Like do slugs have guts? Like really weird things? I'm trying to think what we drew in our notebooks and they're just like random curiosities that they have throughout the world and [00:37:00] how does a light bulb work?

Things like that, that, that are really fun to explore and don't have to cost any extra money. That I think is one thing as, especially for people who are homeschooling without the support of something like open ed homeschooling can be really expensive, but it can also be done. A fraction of the cost. If you're aware of ideas that that can make it possible.

**Ela Bass:** I love that. What are some of your best tips for keeping homeschool budget friendly?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** the

**Ela Bass:** by the way, I absolutely love your Wonder Wall idea. Like I'm noting that down for myself.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Okay. I would, I would love to hear what you discover next time we chat, but yeah, so for inexpensive things, YouTube has so much that you can find, that's a great resource to di dive down lessons. and the library. The library has so many resources and maybe we're just really lucky that we live somewhere that has.

A great library system, but they, they even have something at our library called the Library of Things. And what happens is, I don't know if it's that people donate stuff or where it [00:38:00] comes from, but they have so much stuff. They have board games, they have like random science kits, things like that. I think I saw a guitar there once.

And so you can, you can check that out of the library the same way that you can check books out. And so it's a great way to just be able to try things and see what you think. But even if not, just pulling out books and finding out if you're actually curious about it or if, if one book satisfies that curiosity and you're not really interested in going further, then you know, that's not something to invest in.

And that helps to keep, keep costs down a little bit. something else that we did that, that I feel like was really fun for my kids in the younger years, and actually my son still enjoys the same group of friends, but we created something that we called Nature School. I think I mentioned it earlier, that, In the height of COVID we were looking for a group to be with. And because like I said, our co-op is like 45 minutes away, so we were looking for just like somebody local to hang out with sometimes. And so I don't even know how it all came to be, but basically there was like this random meeting at a park one time where we were like, what are you guys looking for for a group?

And I was like, [00:39:00] my kid just wants to. Play at the park. Like, do you guys wanna meet at a park once a week? And we'll just let them play. And we did it year round. So in the middle of winter, moms are bundled up with our hand warmers and our warm drinks and just like trying to not freeze to death. And, and the kids are running around.

We'd do it in the heat of summer. but we met every week and all it took was because I was the one who threw the idea out, I got put in charge of being the person who did it. I would just pick a random park each week and say, we're meeting here. And it was at the same day and same time every week, but different location.

And, and the kids would just play. And we did that for several years before the group kind of dwindled a little bit. And now there's just a couple friends that we meet up with when we can. but that was a great way that helped me to kind of realize. So often we talk about that it takes a village to raise a kid, but then we're like, well, where's the village?

And it is easy to feel like. This village should be coming to me. And I, I heard a quote that said, if you wanna be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager. and so that's what it took, was being the one who was willing to [00:40:00] pick a park and throw out an email. And that didn't cost anything.

It didn't take any extra work. And so if people are looking for. A non-committal group. I guess it's, it was a commitment every week to sit in the cold or the heat, but that didn't cost anything. It didn't take any extra effort other than driving your kids to the park to go hang out with their friends. To just throw that out there on like a, a homeschool Facebook group in your area and be able to start to rally people.

And then you've got this community that some of my best ideas have come from those friends and. Like I said, my son still loves seeing them, and that's been, I think it's been like five years since we first started the group, so yeah.

**Ela Bass:** Wow. That's amazing. And I, I love your perspective on if it's not there, then start it or be willing to put yourself out there a little bit. 'cause I mean, most of, of the commitments are not that big. Like, yes, there is a little bit larger commitment, quite a bit larger of like running a co-op for a lot of families.

But like there's a lot of really small things that families are looking for. As a perfect [00:41:00] example, nature School. right. Or like, one of the things I know, you know, Charlyn, she mentioned that, something that her family does is they call it, Dad skills. And so something that that, that they do is they have weekly dad skills.

So he takes the kids and will teach them something he has to do anyways. So if it's like something outside or something inside, but like, just as an example, like you could do dad skills with. Multiple families you could, you know, have different dads trade off and like, yeah. And just getting creative with the question of like, what are we gonna do and also how can I make this enjoyable for our kids?

Right. And, I think something that's become more impactful to me over time, just. Chatting with a lot of open ed parents is that you really don't have to do it yourself if you are seeking for help. Like if you are willing to ask the question, like, what other resources could I use or is there anyone around my area or anyone that I know of That has some sort of expertise that I don't have that I can lean on and like there are so many people that are willing to help. Along this line, [00:42:00] I'm curious how you found local resources to begin. You mentioned that you had, some friends and some family that were doing homeschooling, but like where did you begin when you were first trying to find in-person opportunities?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** so like I said, I have a cousin who has homeschooled and her kids have now graduated. They're no longer, I mean, they have a life of learning, but they're no longer learning at her home. And, So she was a great first resource and that's why we actually drive 45 minutes to our co-op is we landed with her and her group of friends.

but then as I gained my own confidence, I was able to realize there are homeschooling Facebook groups. There are like, you don't have to know anyone in person. If you are interested in homeschooling, just hop on Facebook and see what is the local homeschooling. Community, and if there's something that you're looking for, chances are there are plenty of other people also looking for it.

And so when you throw it out there, there are people who will hop on that idea and be interested like you said, you just have to be willing to throw yourself out there and take a risk. But [00:43:00] in my experience, homeschooling families are all really grateful 'cause we're all in the trenches together and anybody who has an idea or is willing to chip in a little bit, other people will meet you and chip in as well.

And it becomes a really cool thing, especially because then you all take ownership in it and you all love it so much more.

**Ela Bass:** I love that you mentioned confidence as a homeschool mom, especially in the beginning is sometimes difficult. Talk a little bit to that and what advice would you give a newer homeschool mom?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** my number one thing I would say is to trust yourself. You will have those doubts and just realize that those doubts are so normal. And even as we've been doing this for several years, I still doubt myself a lot because yes, it is your kid's future, and yes, you're making choices that will impact the rest of their lives, but also who is more invested in your kid than you and who knows your kid better than you?

And so when you keep those two things in mind. Like you love your kids so much that whatever choices you're making, you're trying to make the very best one. And so when you're doubting, like, would it be better if they were [00:44:00] just at school? The teacher might be amazing and love your kid too, but they're never gonna love your kid the way you love your kid.

And so just keeping that in mind that you are doing the very best you can with what you have, and that that is enough for your kid because they're your kid. So that would be my number one piece of advice. And then number two would be, don't do this alone. Go find friends and find a community. Once again, open ed is awesome.

They've been creating field trips and that is a great way to be able to find some people and. You're not going to click with every homeschooler in the world, and that's fine. And homeschooling has so many different philosophies that you're not going to agree with everybody. But if you go into it knowing that and you're just like, we don't all need to look the same and be doing the same thing, we can learn a lot from each other because of our differences.

And so to go find friends and to not do this alone.

**Ela Bass:** That's amazing. I'm gonna hit you with a couple rapid fire questions before we end. but I have [00:45:00] loved every second of this. You are a wealth of knowledge and I'm, I, I love how calm you are.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Thank you.

**Ela Bass:** You're just so calming and I'm like, I love this. okay, rapid fire question number one. What is your biggest homeschool?

Everyone should try this either A, we talked about resources, so either. Something that you do on a day-to-day basis or something that is, I don't know, like a, a home type of thing.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** I would probably say what I was saying with our cocoa club, I think that's something that my kids really look forward to. It doesn't have to be hot chocolate. If you have dietary needs or don't wanna give your kids a sugary drink every week, but something that you gather around the table to eat or do together.

Because when food's involved. There can be more silence and it's not as awkward. if you were to gather on the table and just grill them with questions, that would feel very different. But if they can sip their drink while they ponder your question, they feel very differently about it. And it's a great way to bond.

And like I said, the whole reason we do this is the connection and the time together. And so throwing food in the mix is a [00:46:00] great way to, to do that. And especially if it's something that you don't always do, it feels special to be able to gather around and do that thing together.

**Ela Bass:** I absolutely love that. I think that's a great recommendation and I, that, that makes so much sense, uh, also just to give them something else to do. I know that people talk a lot about the importance of, I don't know, like as an example, like when you're walking and talking, sometimes you have.

A better conversation with somebody just because there are things going around so you have the permission to be quiet for a second and think, and yeah, and it's not just like eyes on you like, oh my gosh, what's happening? I absolutely love that. My second and last rapid fire question for you is, what is a blog or an influencer or a podcast or something that you would recommend that has been pretty instrumental in your journey?

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** there is an Instagram account that I absolutely love and, she talks so much. It's interesting that you said that you felt like this conversation was calming, because that's what I love about her is she talks about like embracing the slow and the calm her gift is to understand like the purpose behind [00:47:00] homeschooling and. What you're getting out of it.

The account is called Wonder Led Life, and she posts just the most heartwarming things for me as it, it's almost, I don't know her personally, but I feel like a lot of times when she makes a post, it is like she knew that I was stressing out over something that day because a lot of it'll be little reminders of, um. Just to remember the, the joyful moments and, to like her, she's got a recent one that says, TIS the season of Hustle and Bustle. Then she has it crossed out and says, slowing down, and just a reminder, like as we're in the busy season of, of things. But she's a homeschool mom. She posts a lot of things of what she's doing with her kids as well, but also takes it from the standpoint of you've gotta take care of mom as well, because if mom's losing her mind, then The kids are gonna be not having as great of an experience and so, so yeah, she's probably my, my most favorite account that I follow is Wonder led Life.

**Ela Bass:** I love that. And actually, I'm gonna throw in one bonus, rapid fire. What do you do as mom who needs to maintain your peace, [00:48:00] to keep, some sort of self care for yourself or like something for yourself.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** Yes, great question. so like I said, we don't typically have a solid start until about 10:00 AM. I am up several hours before that and not several that makes it sound like I'm an early morning person. But I get up and I make sure that I have time to do a workout and I try to read something uplifting, whether that's Scriptures or a TED talk or some kind of something to inspire my mind for that day.

Um, I try to do both of those things for myself each morning before I come out. See the, the chaos that I get to spend my day with. and then in addition to that, I have a couple book clubs that I'm a part of and just try to make sure that by the time that those book clubs roll around, a lot of times I'm feeling like I don't have the energy or the bandwidth to do them, but I notice that if I don't go, I feel like I'm missing. Something. And so I, I just make sure that I get some social time. That is just for me because it is so different to one of my book clubs is actually the moms from my co-op. And yet when [00:49:00] our kids aren't there, it's such a different chance to connect and to talk about what the moms wanna talk about rather than having kids running up or needing something.

It just is a very different feel and so I make sure that I get my social time, my workout, and my uplifting reads, and that seems to help me. Hold it together at least as best I can.

**Ela Bass:** Those are amazing. And, um, yes, I can totally relate to the idea that like, you just need it, it's an entirely different conversation. You're, you're. Your scenario, your settings definitely impact, like the kind of topics you talk about and, a warm, intimate, you know, like fun moment with the girls is definitely different than, just like the chaos of the

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** A family hangout. Yep.

**Ela Bass:** Yeah. well this has been amazing and I hope that a lot of people got a lot out of it. I have loved chatting with you. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast.

**Krisy Shaughnessy:** It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me.
