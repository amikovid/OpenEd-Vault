## COLD OPEN

**KRISY (34:00):** So we never really framed it as a math thing. We kind of did just say like, "Hey, do you wanna play Prodigy?"

**KRISY (34:15):** It's kind of like when you put vegetables in food. There's some veggies you can blend up that's totally unnoticeable.

**KRISY (33:45):** They thought it was a privilege and they didn't realize they were just solving math equations.

**[SWOOSH]**

**KRISY (21:15):** The biggest issue with online classes was there were other kids and it would go off on tangents. They're 11 and almost 13 and they're like, "We're not here for the social time." Okay, like, who are you children?

**[SWOOSH]**

**KRISY (35:45):** As a mom you get asked "why this, how does this work" a million times a day. And it's always at the least convenient time possible.

**KRISY (35:50):** All it takes is a pack of sticky notes and a designated space.

**KRISY (36:00):** They'd go pick one off the wall, we'd grab a notebook and we'd research it.

**[SWOOSH]**

**KRISY (36:30):** Some of 'em were like, "Why do sharks have teeth?" And "Do slugs have guts?"

## DESCRIPTION

Her kids played a math game for three years thinking it was just a video game. They had no idea they were learning.

Krisy Shaughnessy never planned to homeschool. When COVID hit, she found herself renovating a house with her kids—and accidentally discovered they learned more from measuring boards than worksheets.

In this episode, Krisy shares the "vegetable trick" she uses to hide education in plain sight, the $2 Wonder Wall system that captures her kids' questions (like "Do slugs have guts?"), and why she believes boredom is one of the most valuable tools in homeschooling.

She also explains how she built a homeschool community from scratch by simply picking a park and sending an email—and why "if you want to be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager."

## CLIPS FOR SOCIAL

---

### Clip 1: Wonder Wall

**On-screen hook:** "A $2 curiosity system"

**Timestamp range:** 35:45 - 37:00

---

**KRISY (35:45):** ~~Um, a second resource I was gonna tell you about is we call it the Wonder Wall.~~ And so all that it takes cost-wise is a pack of sticky notes and a designated space. ~~And so we had an old, whiteboard that we covered with. It's like, that's press and seal or, peel and stick. That's what it's called, wallpaper. So it looks cute and it's fine hanging up on the wall, but they,~~ *Whenever* they have a question, 'cause as a mom you get asked why this, how does this work a million times a day? And there's something about it that it's always at the least convenient time possible to actually answer that question. 

**KRISY (36:00):** And so what we would do is we put *it* on a sticky note ~~and,~~ so that their question was validated, but I didn't have to answer it right then. And then during our homeschool time, ~~a lot of times it'd be right after we finished our morning meeting,~~ we'd be like, well, do you guys wanna explore one of your *Wonder Wall* questions? And so they'd go pick one off the wall, we'd grab a notebook and we'd research it. We'd draw pictures about it, and it was a great way to dive into the stuff they were curious about while also not having to be asked ~~, asked~~ why a million times a day.

**KRISY (36:30):** ~~? And so. So that's another one that's been really fun and we still even do it as my kids have gotten older. my son, he's my older one, he rolls his eyes a little bit about it still, but my daughter still loves doing it. And so it's a fun way to, to explore curiosity and go down those really weird rabbit trails.~~ Like some of 'em were like, why do sharks have teeth? And, like do slugs have guts? ~~Like really weird things? I'm trying to think what we drew in our notebooks and they're just like random curiosities that they have throughout the world and how does a light bulb work? Things like that, that, that are really fun to explore and don't have to cost any extra money.~~

### Clip 2: Vegetables in Learning

**On-screen hook:** "They didn't know it was math"

**Timestamp range:** 33:30 - 34:30

---

**ELA (33:30):** How did you introduce that out of curiosity? That like, they literally felt like it was a game as opposed to, ~~because I, I would guess that most families would be like, Hey, here's a math game, and kids would still like it, but the fact that they were like, oh my gosh. Like we're, we're, we're playing a game,~~

**KRISY (33:45):** I think it helped that they have some cousins who started playing it around the same time, so it would be like a FaceTime call while they all played and they would find each other in the same world. ~~And so. They were like doing the math to be able to get to the stuff that they needed to.~~ So we never really framed it as a math thing. We kind of did just say like, Hey, do you wanna play Prodigy? ~~And by never saying, oh, you need to do your prodigy so you can get some extra math time in. That was something we didn't really mention and~~ *Not* to be like sketchy or something. It's kind of like when you put vegetables in food, ~~like~~ there's some veggies you can blend up that's totally unnoticeable. You don't need to tell them that the veggies are in there. ~~You just know that they're getting the veggies. And so, It was kind of like that, where it was just how we worded it and I think~~ *They* just thought it was a special privilege.

**ELA (34:30):** ~~I love that. And I, I think the fact that like if you can find something that other people, that they actually back to the whole thing with your, with your dad or their his grandpa, like if you can find people that they enjoy being around that can help to influence them in the right direction, like that is a way to hack it. Like there's gonna be no kid that's like, oh no, I don't wanna play with my cousins unless they don't like 'em, I guess. But, um.~~

### Clip 3: Be the Villager

**On-screen hook:** "Where's the village?"

**Timestamp range:** 38:15 - 40:00

---

**KRISY (38:15):** ~~something else that we did that, that I feel like was really fun for my kids in the younger years, and actually my son still enjoys the same group of friends, but~~ We created something that we called Nature School. ~~I think I mentioned it earlier, that,~~ In the height of COVID we were looking for a group to be with. ~~And because like I said, our co-op is like 45 minutes away, so we were looking for just like somebody local to hang out with sometimes.~~ And so I don't even know how it all came to be, but basically there was like this random meeting at a park one time where we were like, what are you guys looking for for a group? And I was like, my kid just wants to *play* at the park. ~~Like,~~ Do you guys wanna meet at a park once a week? ~~And we'll just let them play.~~ 

**KRISY (39:00):** And we did it year round. So in the middle of winter, moms are bundled up with our hand warmers and our warm drinks and just like trying to not freeze to death. And ~~, and~~ the kids are running around. ~~We'd do it in the heat of summer.~~ But we met every week and all it took was ~~because~~ I *was* the one who threw the idea out, *so* I got put in charge of being the person who did it. I would just pick a random park each week and say, we're meeting here. ~~And it was at the same day and same time every week, but different location. And, and the kids would just play. And we did that for several years before the group kind of dwindled a little bit. And now there's just a couple friends that we meet up with when we can. but that was a great way that helped me to kind of realize.~~ 

**KRISY (39:30):** So often we talk about that it takes a village to raise a kid, but then we're like, well, where's the village? ~~And it is easy to feel like. This village should be coming to me. And~~ I heard a quote that said, if you wanna be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager. ~~and so~~ That's what it took, was being the one who was willing to pick a park and throw out an email. ~~And that didn't cost anything. It didn't take any extra work.~~

### Clip 4: Trust Yourself

**On-screen hook:** "They'll never love your kid like you do"

**Timestamp range:** 43:00 - 44:15

---

**KRISY (43:00):** ~~my number one thing I would say is to~~ *Trust* yourself. You will have those doubts and just realize that those doubts are so normal. And even as we've been doing this for several years, I still doubt myself a lot because yes, it is your kid's future, and yes, you're making choices that will impact the rest of their lives, but also who is more invested in your kid than you and who knows your kid better than you? 

**KRISY (43:30):** ~~And so when you keep those two things in mind. Like you love your kids so much that whatever choices you're making, you're trying to make the very best one. And so when you're doubting, like, would it be better if they were just at school?~~ The teacher might be amazing and love your kid too, but they're never gonna love your kid the way you love your kid. 

**KRISY (44:00):** ~~And so just keeping that in mind that~~ You are doing the very best you can with what you have, and that *is* enough for your kid because they're your kid. ~~So that would be my number one piece of advice. And then number two would be, don't do this alone. Go find friends and find a community. Once again, open ed is awesome. They've been creating field trips and that is a great way to be able to find some people and. You're not going to click with every homeschooler in the world, and that's fine. And homeschooling has so many different philosophies that you're not going to agree with everybody. But if you go into it knowing that and you're just like, we don't all need to look the same and be doing the same thing, we can learn a lot from each other because of our differences. And so to go find friends and to not do this alone.~~

### Clip 5: Cocoa Club

**On-screen hook:** "Food makes conversation easier"

**Timestamp range:** 28:00 - 28:30, 45:30 - 46:00

---

**KRISY (28:00):** ~~For example,~~ We have something that we call Cocoa Club, and it's on Friday mornings. ~~It's~~ Every Friday we make a nice big cup of hot chocolate and we read poetry. ~~I know some people have called it poetry tea time, but we had a friend who has all boys and they're like. My kids do not want to have tea time. It's not a tea party. So we pivoted to hot chocolate and I was like, oh, that's a great idea. Like I think my kids would love that more than, than a tea time. And so, we've been doing that for years and it's, we'll either pull out poetry books or we just do something called free writing where they have a prompt and they just write whatever they can think for a certain amount of time and then we see what we find. and so that was all an idea that came from someone else.~~

[CUT TO]

**KRISY (45:30):** ~~I would probably say what I was saying with our cocoa club, I think that's something that my kids really look forward to. It doesn't have to be hot chocolate. If you have dietary needs or don't wanna give your kids a sugary drink every week, but~~ Something that you gather around the table to eat or do together. Because when food's involved ~~.~~ *there* can be more silence and it's not as awkward. ~~if you were to gather on the table and just grill them with questions, that would feel very different.~~ But if they can sip their drink while they ponder your question, they feel very differently about it. ~~And it's a great way to bond. And like I said, the whole reason we do this is the connection and the time together. And so throwing food in the mix is a great way to, to do that. And especially if it's something that you don't always do, it feels special to be able to gather around and do that thing together.~~

### Clip 6: Day in the Life Supercut

**On-screen hook options:**
- "A week in our homeschool"
- "This is what homeschool actually looks like"
- "No two days look the same"
- "Our version of 'school'"

**Format:** Quick cuts, [SWOOSH] between each moment. ~45-60 seconds total.

---

**KRISY (08:00):** Sometimes they're just sitting on the couch looking totally zoned out. ~~And it might not seem like they're using the time well, but when I've talked to them and checked in to see what's going on,~~ They're thinking about things.

[SWOOSH]

**KRISY (06:30):** Around 10:00 we sit down and do what we call our morning meeting.

[SWOOSH]

**KRISY (36:30):** "Why do sharks have teeth?" And "Do slugs have guts?"

[SWOOSH]

**KRISY (12:00):** Wednesday we have a co-op that we go to. ~~We drive about 45 minutes for our co-op because we found one that we really love and~~ It's an all-day thing.

[SWOOSH]

**KRISY (28:00):** Every Friday we make a nice big cup of hot chocolate and we read poetry.

[SWOOSH]

**KRISY (39:00):** In the middle of winter, moms are bundled up with our hand warmers ~~and our warm drinks and~~ just trying to not freeze to death. And the kids are running around.

[SWOOSH]

**KRISY (32:30):** It feels almost like we're cheating the system somehow by getting to spend so many extra hours with our kids.
