## SNIPPET INVENTORY

Short quotable moments (5-30 sec each) - the building blocks for cold opens and clips.

---

### COUNTERINTUITIVE / SURPRISING

**[S1] "They didn't know it was math" (33:45)**
> They thought it was a privilege and they didn't realize they were just solving math equations.

**[S2] "Never framed it" (34:00)**
> So we never really framed it as a math thing. We kind of did just say like, "Hey, do you wanna play Prodigy?"

**[S3] "Vegetables in food" (34:15)**
> It's kind of like when you put vegetables in food. There's some veggies you can blend up that's totally unnoticeable. You don't need to tell them that the veggies are in there.

**[S4] "Learning's boring → Curiosity came back" (24:00-24:30)**
> They would come home and just be like, "Learning's boring." ... And then when we pulled them out, curiosity came back. And they were like, "Oh, what do I wanna learn about?"

**[S5] "Sitting in a room" (25:00)**
> Sitting in a room and being taught something doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna retain it. But if you go discover it, your brain stores it differently.

**[S6] "Value of boredom" (08:00)**
> Sometimes they are just sitting on the couch looking totally zoned out. And I think there's such a value to some boredom.

**[S7] "Great without a workbook" (03:00)**
> That's part of what sold me on it—oh, they're doing great without a workbook.

**[S8] "Not here for social time" (21:30)**
> The biggest issue with online classes was there were other kids and it would go off on tangents. They're like, "That's not what we're here for." ... They're 11 and almost 13 and they're like, "We're not here for the social time." Okay, like, who are you children?

---

### MEMORABLE QUOTES

**[S9] "Be the villager" (39:30)**
> So often we talk about "it takes a village to raise a kid," but then we're like, "Well, where's the village?" I heard a quote: "If you wanna be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager."

**[S10] "Never love your kid like you" (44:00)**
> The teacher might be amazing and love your kid too. But they're never gonna love your kid the way you love your kid.

**[S11] "Enough for your kid" (44:15)**
> You are doing the very best you can with what you have. And that is enough for your kid, because they're your kid.

**[S12] "Who knows your kid better?" (43:30)**
> Who is more invested in your kid than you? And who knows your kid better than you?

**[S13] "Relationship is the priority" (33:00)**
> The relationship and the connection is the priority, and everything else seems to just work out.

---

### RELATABLE / FUNNY

**[S14] "Million times a day" (35:45)**
> As a mom you get asked "why this, how does this work" a million times a day. And there's something about it—it's always at the least convenient time possible.

**[S15] "Slugs have guts" (36:30)**
> Some of 'em were like, "Why do sharks have teeth?" And "Do slugs have guts?"

**[S16] "Trying not to freeze" (39:00)**
> We did it year round. In the middle of winter, moms are bundled up with hand warmers and warm drinks, just trying to not freeze to death. And the kids are running around.

**[S17] "Cookies all day" (27:30)**
> It's a lot easier now than when they were kindergarten, first graders where they're like, "I don't know, I just wanna eat cookies all day."

**[S18] "Cheating the system" (32:30)**
> It feels almost like we're cheating the system somehow, by getting to spend so many extra hours with our kids.

---

### PRACTICAL / ACTIONABLE

**[S19] "Pack of sticky notes" (35:45)**
> All it takes is a pack of sticky notes and a designated space.

**[S20] "Pick one off the wall" (36:00)**
> They'd go pick one off the wall, we'd grab a notebook and we'd research it. We'd draw pictures about it.

**[S21] "Pick a park" (39:15)**
> All it took was—I threw the idea out, so I got put in charge. I would just pick a random park each week and say, "We're meeting here."

**[S22] "Cocoa Club" (28:00)**
> We have something called Cocoa Club. Every Friday we make a nice big cup of hot chocolate and we read poetry.

**[S23] "Food helps conversation" (45:30)**
> When food's involved, there can be more silence and it's not as awkward. If they can sip their drink while they ponder your question, they feel very differently about it.

**[S24] "Validated but didn't answer" (36:00)**
> We'd put it on a sticky note, so their question was validated, but I didn't have to answer it right then.

---

### TRUST / EMOTIONAL

**[S25] "Trust yourself" (43:00)**
> My number one thing would be to trust yourself. You will have those doubts—just realize that those doubts are so normal.

**[S26] "I still doubt myself" (43:15)**
> Even after several years, I still doubt myself a lot. Because yes, it's your kid's future. Yes, you're making choices that will impact the rest of their lives.

---

### ORIGIN STORY

**[S27] "House projects" (02:30)**
> The first several months of our homeschooling actually looked like working on house projects together. And it was amazing to see how much learning could happen in everyday stuff.

**[S28] "Calculate and measure" (02:45)**
> They would help me calculate or measure. And it all just came really naturally.

**[S29] "Loved it more than we thought" (00:45)**
> That's what threw us into homeschooling, and we've loved it more than we thought we would.
