## Media (Image or Video)

**Most important part of your ad.** It's what people see first.

- 90%+ of your communication is done with the media, NOT the primary text and headline
- Put all the text you need in your image or video

---

## Primary Text

- Keep it **125 characters or less** so it's not cut off by "See More" (use Character Counter Tool)
- Longer copy can work well - make it readable and scannable with bullets
- **Never use more than 2 lines without a break** - use short sentences
- Use tasteful and relevant emojis (via Emojipedia) - emojis increase CTR

---

## Headline

- This is what people see 3rd
- **Not seen on IG placements**
- Keep it short and simple, ideally **<50 characters**
- Use the primary benefit, ease of benefit, social proof, or CTA

---

## Description

- This is what people see last
- **Not seen on all placements**
- Keep it very short, **<30 characters**
- Use "free", social proof, or CTA

### Examples
- "Join FREE"
- "Sign Up Today"
- "Join 10k+ Readers"
