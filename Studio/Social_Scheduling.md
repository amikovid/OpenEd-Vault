- [ ] Approve Option A

**Option B - Personal Story (full arc):**
> @EverydayReading is a school librarian with somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books in her house. Her first daughter tested at a 12th-grade reading level in kindergarten. Her second daughter couldn't read at all - same books, same read-alouds, same mom. She eventually figured out what worked: a college kid on Zoom doing 25-minute sessions a few times a week. The daughter went from barely passing to reading at an 11th-grade level by 5th grade.
