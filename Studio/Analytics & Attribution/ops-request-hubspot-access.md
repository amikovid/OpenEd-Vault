**To:** Ops
**From:** Charlie
**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Priority:** High (needed for Q3 KPI tracking)

## Request

I need expanded HubSpot access for marketing attribution, form management, and email analytics.

## What I Need Access To

### 1. Contact Data (Read)
- **Original Source** - Where the contact first came from (organic, social, paid, etc.)
- **First Page Seen** - What page they landed on
- **Recent Conversion** - What form/action they took
- **Lifecycle Stage** - Where they are in the funnel (subscriber → lead → customer)
- **Create Date** - When they entered the system
- **Purpose:** See which channels drive signups

### 2. Lists & Reports (Read + Create)
- Create saved lists filtered by source/date
- View existing dashboards and reports
- Build custom reports on contact acquisition
- **Purpose:** Build weekly acquisition reports, segment audiences

### 3. Marketing Forms (Read + Write)
- Create and edit forms
- View form submissions and analytics
- Embed forms on Webflow pages
- **Purpose:** Build new lead capture forms for blog, curricula, landing pages

### 4. Marketing Email (Read)
- View email campaign performance
- See open rates, click rates, engagement by campaign
- Historical email analytics
- **Purpose:** Understand what content resonates, inform content strategy

### 5. Contact Import (Write - Limited)
- Ability to import/upload contact lists
- **Purpose:** Upload segmented lists for campaigns
- **Note:** I don't need bulk delete access

### What I DON'T Need
- Deal/pipeline access (sales data)
- Workflow editing (could trigger unintended automations)
- Account/billing settings
- User management
- Bulk delete permissions

### Suggested Role
If there's a standard "Marketing User" or "Content Creator" role that covers the above, that would work. Otherwise happy to discuss specific permissions.

## Why I Need This

Melissa's "Raise the Bar" initiative calls for being data-driven - using data to drive strategy, not just report on it. Right now I can see:
- Traffic data (GA4) ✓
- Social follower counts ✓
- Newsletter subscriber totals ✓

But I can't see:
- Which channels actually drive subscriber signups
- Whether those subscribers become leads
- Whether those leads enroll

This attribution data exists in HubSpot - I just need read access to see it.

## Expected Outcome

With this access I'll build:
1. **Weekly acquisition report** - Subscribers by source (organic, social, paid, referral)
2. **Channel attribution dashboard** - Which content efforts actually drive signups
3. **Funnel conversion rates** - Subscriber → Lead → Enrollment percentages

This directly supports my Q3 KPIs and the compensation conversation with [CMO].

## Timeline

Ideally before end of this week so I can start building reports for Q3 planning.
