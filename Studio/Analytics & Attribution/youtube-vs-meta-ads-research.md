## Recommendation: Fall Enrollment YouTube Test

### Should OpenEd Test YouTube Ads?

**Yes, with caveats.**

**Reasons to test:**
1. Strong research/evaluation behavior on YouTube for education decisions
2. ESA services require explanation - YouTube's longer format excels here
3. 90-day attribution window captures longer consideration cycles
4. Homeschool audience is growing 2-8% annually with 30% new entrants each year
5. Complements existing Meta strategy for full-funnel coverage

**Potential challenges:**
- Homeschool community is "close-knit and highly brand loyal" - word of mouth carries more weight than ads
- Requires quality video creative (higher production investment than Meta)
- Longer optimization period (8-12 weeks vs Meta's faster testing)

### Recommended Budget

| Phase | Duration | Daily Budget | Total |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Test** | 4 weeks | $30-50/day | $840-$1,400 |
| **Phase 2: Optimize** | 4 weeks | $50-75/day | $1,400-$2,100 |
| **Phase 3: Scale (if working)** | Ongoing | $100+/day | Variable |

**Minimum viable test:** $1,500-$2,000 over 8 weeks.

### Recommended Campaign Structure

1. **Video Action Campaign** (primary)
   - Objective: Lead form submissions
   - Format: Skippable in-stream with lead form
   - Targeting: Custom intent (homeschool/ESA keywords) + parental status
   - States: Focus on 2-3 highest-potential ESA states initially

2. **TrueView for Reach** (secondary)
   - Objective: Awareness for fall enrollment
   - Format: 15-30 second skippable
   - Targeting: Broader affinity audiences + parental status
   - Retarget viewers with Meta campaigns

### Success Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CPV | Under $0.15 |
| View rate | Above 25% |
| Cost per lead | Under $20 |
| Lead form conversion rate | Above 10% |

---

## Summary

**Test YouTube ads for fall 2026 enrollment with a $1,500-2,000 budget over 8 weeks.** Focus on Video Action Campaigns with lead forms, targeting parents in your strongest ESA states using custom intent audiences around homeschool and ESA-related searches.

YouTube should serve as your **awareness and consideration** channel, warming audiences who then convert via Meta retargeting or direct. The platforms work best together - YouTube for explanation and trust-building, Meta for conversion and community.
