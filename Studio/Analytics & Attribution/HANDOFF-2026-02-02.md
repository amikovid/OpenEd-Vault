## Open Issues

### Meta Ads Access
- Token has `ads_read` + `ads_management` permissions
- But Matt Bowman's FB account is not added to OpenEd's Business Manager
- Only visible ad account is a personal one with $0 spend
- **Fix:** An OpenEd Business Manager admin needs to add Matt Bowman under People, then grant Ad Account analyst access
- Once done, the existing token will automatically see OpenEd's ad account

### meta.py Uses Deprecated Metrics
- Meta deprecated `impressions` and `plays` in API v22+
- The module calls `v18.0` which still partially works
- Post-level reach works; impressions and video plays return errors on newer posts
- Valid metrics for media insights now: `reach, saved, likes, comments, shares, total_interactions, follows, profile_visits`
- **Next step:** Update `meta.py` to use current metric names

### OpenEd Daily Emails Not Found
- Only 2 Daily emails found in HubSpot's top 100 campaigns
- The ~9K sends match the Weekly newsletter list size
- Possible: Daily emails go through a different system, or are named without "daily" in the campaign name
- **Investigate:** Ask the marketing team what system sends the Daily newsletter
