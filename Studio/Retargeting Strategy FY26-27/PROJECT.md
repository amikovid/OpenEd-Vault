## Strategic Overview

### Objective

Recover lost pipeline and maximize ROI by re-engaging high-intent audiences who didn't convert, while building sustainable retargeting infrastructure for ongoing optimization.

---

## Three-Pillar Approach

### Pillar 1: Known Lead Recovery

**Goal:** Convert parents who showed interest but never enrolled.

**Audiences:**
- 11,380 interested or applied non-enrollees from SY25-26 (6,878) and MY26 (4,502)
- Single unified Meta Custom Audience for simplified targeting
- Sequential creative strategy addresses all funnel stages

**Tactics:**
- Email nurture campaigns
- Meta Custom Audience retargeting (one audience, multiple creative variations)

---

### Pillar 2: Digital Behavior Retargeting

**Goal:** Capture website visitors and ad engagers who showed interest but didn't apply.

**Audiences:**
- Website visitors
- Ad clickers and video viewers
- Social media engagers

**Tactics:**
- Meta Pixel retargeting
- Google Display/YouTube remarketing
- Sequential messaging based on engagement level

---

### Pillar 3: Lookalike Expansion

**Goal:** Scale efficient acquisition by targeting audiences similar to enrolled students.

**Audiences:**
- Lookalike audiences built from 17,000+ enrolled families

**Tactics:**
- 1% lookalikes for quality
- 3-5% lookalikes for scale
- Continuous optimization based on conversion data
