## Key Insights

### 2026 Algorithm Changes (Andromeda)
- Creative is now the primary targeting signal
- Creative diversity matters more than volume
- Same image with different text = Meta sees as same (punishes you)
- Lo-fi/native content outperforms polished production

### Format Performance Expectations
| Format | Best For | Difficulty |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Text-Only Static | Cold traffic, pattern interrupt | Very Easy |
| Split-Screen | Comparisons, solution-aware | Easy |
| Partnership Ads | Trust, lower CPA | Medium (requires creator) |
| Ad Reaction | Extending winners, addressing objections | Easy |
| Educational Micro-Series | Deep engagement, retargeting | Medium |

### Sticky Sentence Techniques
- **Alliteration:** "Worksheets aren't wisdom"
- **Contrast:** "Busywork vs Brilliance"
- **Rhythm:** "Same kid. Different setting. Different results."
- **Symmetry:** "Different brains, different timelines"
