**Parent Project:** [Project Dandelion](../../Projects/Project-Dandelion/PROJECT.md)

---

## Overview

This project contains:

- A meta-ads-creative skill with reference documents
- 2026 ad trends research
- Testimonials database for copy mining
- Curriculum-specific targeting campaign concept

---

## Key Performance Insights

**From Dandelion performance analysis** (see `Projects/Project-Dandelion/research/meta-ads-performance-analysis-2026-01-28.md`):

| Format | CPA | Volume | Takeaway |
|--------|-----|--------|----------|
| Notes App | $5.33 | 747 apps | Best high-volume performer |
| MG2 (video + text) | $4.25 | 142 apps | Lowest CPA |
| Text-Heavy (black/white) | $5.82 | 1,278 apps | Highest volume |
| Text-Heavy (styled) | $121.77 | 10 apps | **Same copy, 28x worse** |

**Key lesson:** Lo-fi, native-feeling formats dramatically outperform polished designs. Same copy with "corporate" styling (highlights, underlines) performed 28x worse

## Key Insights

### 2026 Algorithm Changes (Andromeda)
- Creative is now the primary targeting signal
- Creative diversity matters more than volume
- Same image with different text = Meta sees as same (punishes you)
- Lo-fi/native content outperforms polished production

### Format Performance Expectations
| Format | Best For | Difficulty |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Text-Only Static | Cold traffic, pattern interrupt | Very Easy |
| Split-Screen | Comparisons, solution-aware | Easy |
| Partnership Ads | Trust, lower CPA | Medium (requires creator) |
| Ad Reaction | Extending winners, addressing objections | Easy |
| Educational Micro-Series | Deep engagement, retargeting | Medium |

### Sticky Sentence Techniques
- **Alliteration:** "Worksheets aren't wisdom"
- **Contrast:** "Busywork vs Brilliance"
- **Rhythm:** "Same kid. Different setting. Different results."
- **Symmetry:** "Different brains, different timelines"
