Just discovered OpenEd and I'm shocked more people don't know about this

I've been homeschooling for 3 years and spending $1000+ annually on curriculum, plus classes, plus co-ops...

A friend told me about OpenEd. It's a public school partnership that gives you:

- Hundreds of classes
- A dedicated homeroom teacher
- Funds for materials and activities

And it's... tuition-free?

We joined last month. Already saved hundreds. Same quality, better support.

UPDATE: Pulled my autistic daughter from school - here's what happened

3 months ago I posted about whether to pull my daughter out. She couldn't handle full-day school due to sensory processing and anxiety. She was crying during every last period.

Well, I did it. Found a program called OpenEd.

She now:
- Learns at home at her own pace
- Still takes 2 classes at her high school (orchestra)
- Has a dedicated teacher who actually GETS her

She went from crying every day to being a contributing member of her school orchestra.

For parents on the fence: do it.

Schools said my kid needed to "keep up." OpenEd let him catch up.

In public school, my son has learning disabilities. The school kept saying "everyone else is moving forward so your child has to move forward."

He was falling further and further behind because they wouldn't let him master concepts before moving on.

We joined OpenEd (tuition-free btw).

Now he can take the time to make sure core concepts are solid before building on them.

He's actually catching up now. Not falling behind.

Sometimes slower is faster.
