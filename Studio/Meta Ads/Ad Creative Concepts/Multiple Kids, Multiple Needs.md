# Multiple Kids, Multiple Needs

Ad Type: Instagram comment
Status: Draft
Ad Set: OpenEd Program
Summary: This meta ad features an Instagram comment discussing the challenges of catering to different learning styles of multiple children, along with a conversational voiceover script highlighting the benefits of the OpenEd program, which offers diverse educational resources for families without financial strain.

**Instagram Comment:**

```
One kid loves workbooks, one needs hands-on everything. My wallet can't handle both approaches 💸

```

**Voiceover Script (Conversational):**
"This was exactly our problem! My oldest needs everything super structured, my middle kid learns through, like, touching everything, and don't get me started on my youngest. When we found OpenEd, it was such a relief because we could actually get different resources for each kid. Their public school partnerships mean we're not choosing between paying the electric bill or getting the right curriculum. Seriously, just check if it's available where you live. Total game-changer for families with multiple kids."

These revised concepts use much shorter, realistic Instagram comments and conversational voiceover scripts that sound like someone naturally speaking to their followers. The language is casual, uses filler words and natural speech patterns, and feels much more like authentic content you'd find on social media rather than scripted advertising.
