**Instagram Comment:**

```
My 10yo is NOT a morning person. These 7am wake-ups for school are killing us both 😴

```

**Voiceover Script (Conversational):**
"Girl, same! We switched to OpenEd and now we start our day at like 10am when my kids' brains are actually awake. They finish all their work in a few hours because they're focused, and then they have the rest of the day for the stuff they're actually into. It's wild how much happier everyone is. My kids think I'm some kind of educational genius but I just get all these ideas from their daily newsletter. Total game-changer."
