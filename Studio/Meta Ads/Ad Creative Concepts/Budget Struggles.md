**Voiceover Script (Conversational):**
"Oh my gosh, this was literally me last year! Then I found out about OpenEd. They partner with public schools so your kids can access all these amazing resources without the crazy price tag. My son is doing this robotics thing I could never afford before, and my daughter finally found the math curriculum that actually makes sense to her. Just look them up - took me like 5 minutes to apply and it's changed everything for us."
