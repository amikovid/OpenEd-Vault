Status: Draft
Ad Set: OpenEd Program
Summary: The ad features testimonials from a homeschooling mom, Keri, who shares how OpenEd has provided her with the support and resources needed to successfully homeschool her three boys, emphasizing the program's financial assistance and personalized education options.

"OpenEd gave me the courage to try homeschooling when I genuinely thought it was out of my reach. As a single mom to three boys, working a 9-5 job, I didn't see how I could make it work. Having access to funding, free resources, and a smorgasbord of support, I've been able to provide each of my children with a personalized education that is as unique as they are."

"When we pulled our kids out of public school, it was such a relief when we found OpenEd. The financial support has made personalized education possible and, as parents, we finally feel seen and understood. It is clear OpenEd is listening to families and actively working to meet our needs. They are easy to work with and offer a wealth of valuable resources."

“With OpenEd, I found the perfect balance between structure and flexibility for my six children, giving them the freedom to pursue their passions while still covering all the essentials. After homeschooling since 2004, I've seen how OpenEd has expanded the options available to families, making personalized education more accessible than ever before.”
