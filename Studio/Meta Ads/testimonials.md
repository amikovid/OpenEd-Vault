- "For our family, Open Education means having the freedom to choose what works best for each of our children in different seasons of life. We’ve experienced both public school and homeschooling, and we’re now exploring a split enrollment option for our oldest two. The ability to customize their education to fit their specific needs has been a game-changer. It empowers them to feel more successful as they take an active role in shaping their educational journey."
- "My son was greatly struggling with the expectations of in-person public school. He was unable to be still and quiet for the amount of time required, and he was losing his passion for learning. With the help of My Tech High, we have been able to personalize his education. We use hands-on curriculum and activities, and have been able to cover the cost of more active and hands-on supplement classes through various co-ops and community programs. He went from being behind in math, to being about one grade level ahead. He has recovered his joy for learning and loves doing hands-on science and engineering projects."
- "My daughter is in kindergarten with MTH. She has severe anxiety. MTH is the answer to our prayers. She was having stomach problems and crying fits daily. All of that is gone! Although MTH has online curriculum available, we chose a book-based curriculum that is not online and my daughter is thriving."
- "My child is on the autism spectrum, so she is unable to go to a full day of school due to her sensory processing disorder and anxiety disorder. My Tech High has enabled her to learn at home and be reimbursed for the approved materials I have chosen, while still taking two classes at Tooele High. She is a contributing member of the orchestra at the high school. When she was getting all her classes at Tooele Jr High, she was not able to function and cried during the entire last period of the day (which just happened to be Orchestra). My Tech High has allowed her to get quality learning materials at home while still having a normal, teenage life."
- "We have loved the flexibility that we get through My Tech High and it's made a huge difference to our kids that have different learning styles and abilities. As long as they are making steady progress, they're fine. It's okay if they're in one grade in one subject and in an entirely different one in another. It's about where they're at and catering things to their needs in each individual subject."
- "My Tech High has given Halle the boost she needed for this next year of homeschooling. I'm deeply grateful to the staff who have spent so much time helping me understand how things work. We've loved the home resources and classes, especially as Halle made a virtual connection with her wonderful homeroom teacher Mikaela. My Tech High is the best homeschooling program out there!"
- "My son had a very rough time in public school. He is definitely an outlier, as he is 2e: gifted and ADHD. We have found that My Tech High is perfect for him. He can craft his own curriculum (under parental supervision) and the contact he has with his teacher is a no pressure situation. While public school is good for the average child, My Tech High is perfect for those who have different needs."
- "My daughter was diagnosed with a life threatening chronic health condition at age 3. This disease often requires us to wake up multiple times in the middle of the night, night after night, leaving us exhausted for years. Thanks to MTH we could get more rest in the morning, and start school later in the day. And at 16 years old, Lilly has completed 98 college credits through MTH's early college options, along with developing various other interests and talents."
- "We are able to go on field trips and do lots of fun things because of the resources that we've been given through My Tech. Our children are very unique; they need their own personalized education so that they can be learning the things that are pertinent to them. We love the My Tech program because it gives us the funds to do these things, which with a tight budget and a large family, we wouldn't be able to do otherwise."
- "We have loved being involved in this program because of the freedom of choice it gives the kids in choosing what they want to study and how they want to study it. It also gives them amazing technology skills that they can use while they're studying things like history or math or any of the liberal arts. It really helps integrate those with technology so that they're not just really well educated, but they have the skills that they're going to need to work in today's world and to be able to perform really well."
- "One of my kids came from school to home education and I did not know, and he didn't know at the time that he had a social battery that got drained so quick at school that he had nothing emotionally to give his schoolwork. And so we, he still goes for those two classes he can go to school for, and still attend My Tech High and that utilizes enough of his social battery that he still has more to give his schoolwork. So he went from being a C student at school to now being a 4.0 student and his mental health has improved as well as his grades."

- "In 3rd and 4th grade Evelyn studied voiceover techniques and production in her tech class. As part of her lesson she completed a remote audition for a local education company and though she was not cast at the time, she nailed it, and they kept her audition on file. This year she has completed three paid recording sessions with them, and has opened her first bank account! They love her and keep asking her back. She is so excited to have a real skill that she can market at age 10!"
- "We were really nervous about pulling our kids out of public school like every other mother would be. But one thing I noticed, one of my children was starting to get ahead in school and we were actually talking to the principal about maybe moving her ahead of grade 'cause she was doing so well and they actually said they didn't prefer that. Since we have pulled her out of school and my other two kids actually, they have all been at least ahead in one subject or another, because they're not being held back. And that was something too that was just really neat, to see, you know, just let my kids do what they they're interested in."

# Choice Quotes:

### Here are some longer, more powerful potential testimonial quotes from the transcript:

"Mystery science has been phenomenal for my family. They have loved it and they're on it frequently. They talk about the lessons, it's completely independent learning. I am not involved in it at all other than to hear the fun facts that they've learned. But mystery science has been very engaging and very intuitive for the kids to use and has led to some really great discussions." (Allison)

"We were really nervous about pulling our kids out of public school like every other mother would be. But one thing I noticed, one of my children was starting to get ahead in school and we were actually talking to the principal about maybe moving her ahead of grade 'cause she was doing so well and they actually said they didn't prefer that. Since we have pulled her out of school and my other two kids actually, they have all been at least ahead in one subject or another, because they're not being held back. And that was something too that was just really neat, to see, you know, just let my kids do what they they're interested in." (Kaylee)

"A couple of my learners have some learning disabilities and what has been equally wonderful is in school they were left behind and when we tried to get help and assistance for them, the exact opposite of Kaylee, they said, well, everybody else is moving forward so your child has to move forward. It's really nice to be able to take the time to make sure those core concepts are solid so that they can continue building their knowledge base." (Allison)

"For a parent to sit back and go, there's gotta be lots of grace for me and my kids as we learn and process and even as a seasoned parent, oh, we're up against something that's new for us, so let's just take a breath and take it slow and we'll get through it. One thing I found for my kids, that transition from struggling to success was one of my kids came from home, from school to home education and I did not know, and he didn't know at the time that he had a social battery that got drained so quick at school that he had nothing emotionally to give his schoolwork." (Jenny)

### Here are some potential standalone clips that could work as testimonials:

"Mystery Science and Generation Genius, hands down, have been phenomenal for my family. They have loved it, it's completely independent learning for them." (Allison)

"My kids beg for Mystery Science, they love it." (Kaylee)

"We've seen a huge increase in curriculum and classes over the four years we've been here. I love the diversity of curriculum. It feels accessible." (Allison)

"Since they aren't being held back, they've gotten ahead in subjects they're interested in and passionate about, even with less handholding from me. It's been impressive." (Kaylee)

"It's really nice here to be able to take the time they need to ensure core concepts are solid before moving forward." (Allison, on kids with disabilities)

"One of my kids went from a C student to a 4.0 by having his social needs met better through homeschooling." (Jenny)

Polished Version:

### Chapter 1: Introduction and Introductions

Speaker 1: Hello everyone. I am here with a fantastic group of MiTek High parents, and I'm excited for you to meet them. In a minute, you'll get to meet Mary, Kaylee, Allison, and Jenny.

Today, we are discussing our Homeroom resources and our MiTech High direct courses. These parents are incredible and experienced with these resources. They bring a wealth of information, knowledge, tips, and we are excited for you to hear what they have to share.

We trust that their experiences will guide you and other MyTech High families as you consider which Homeroom resources you might want to use, and also, which MyTech High direct courses will best supplement your students' education.

[Each parent introduces themselves]

### Chapter 2: Homeroom Resources

Speaker 1: So for those that might be unfamiliar, Homeroom resources are resources available to all of our MyTech High families without being put on their schedule. They are supplemental resources that cover all major subject areas in all grades and are freely available for you to use as you see fit in your family.

Would somebody start by telling us what Homeroom resources you have used and how they have helped you or how they've worked with your schooling?

Kaylee: Since it's our first year, we decided to try a lot because we wanted to explore and understand it. We went towards Study Island while we figured out all these other resources because Study Island helps teach you all the grades... One of the biggest things is being able to try these resources has helped us figure out what kind of learners my kids are... And then figuring out which ones we liked and which ones fell short in certain areas, so we could combine resources effectively for our needs.

Mary: When we started MyTech High, we actually started in the middle of the year... I think the most important phase of that transition was figuring out what curriculum worked best for your kid. If they don't like it, they're not going to learn from it as well, and it's just going to be a fight. So I make sure my kids get to choose a lot of the things they do as much as I can.

### Chapter 3: MyTech High Direct Courses

Speaker 1: So let's shift gears a little bit to some of those MyTech High direct courses. These are courses that fulfill a period on your students' schedule. I think all of you have used them. What was the decision process for choosing a MyTech High direct course? How did you decide which one to choose?

Re: We chose the Ignite Program for my oldest son in 10th grade to fulfill his entire schedule. It was a big decision because all your funding goes towards one program, but we were excited about the opportunity for him to work towards his associate's degree. It's been a great experience, though some classes are easier than others. We've learned good communication skills with our professors.

Jenny: We did the in-person Makerspace option at one point, which was great for unstructured exploration of different technologies, though my kids prefer being assigned projects. We also did the Spark program for my high schoolers, which allowed for flexibility - we could do 3-4 classes at a time rather than a full 7 class schedule. It meant processing at their own pace.

Allison: My oldest did a web design class because technology is outside my skill set. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good fit - having some video meetups with the teacher would have been helpful for real-time explanations.

Mary: When we choose resources, I usually have multiple kids enrolled in the same course so they can help each other out if stuck. This past year, two did Python, and having a sibling in the same class made a big difference when they got frustrated on tricky assignments.

### Chapter 4: Successful Resources

Speaker 1: Can you think of any resources that have been just a home run for your families? The perfect thing at the perfect time? And then the opposite - which ones have you tried that have just not worked out for whatever reason?

Allison: Mystery Science and Generation Genius, hands down, have been phenomenal for my family. They have loved it, it's completely independent learning for them, and has led to great discussions.

Kaylee: My kids beg for Mystery Science, they love it. The earthquake lesson where you build a house and see what happens was so engaging. But we tried Music Quest and even though I'm a piano teacher, my kids really struggled with it.

Re: Echoing the rest, Mystery Science, BrainPOP, and Generation Genius have been great. Towards the end of the year we use Study Island to make sure we covered everything. And for Ignite, the psychology and history classes were home runs.

Jenny: A home run was the Spark English language programs after pulling my kids from public school - it taught them proper grammar and paper writing.

Mary: A lot of the game-based learning ones like Math Prodigy were enjoyed, though they can get distracted with those. They loved Generation Genius and KiwiCrates too.

Allison: My kids liked Imagine Math as it felt like playing video games. But My WritingAI was difficult because the expectations weren't clear.

Speaker 1: Let me ask if there's any programs in particular that have helped in an area of struggle, academically or where a subject didn't go well in public school but went better when you pulled them out?

Jenny: We really liked the Spark English language programs after I looked at my kids' writing from public school and realized it needed work.=

### Chapter 5: Parent Involvement

Speaker 1: I would love to know about any of the resources you want to talk about in terms of parent involvement. Which ones have been just open and go for your students? Which ones have needed a little bit more of oversight from you?

Re: With Ignite, the college-level courses, it is open and go for the student as it's created by a professor. But I still think you need some parent oversight, especially for younger students, to make sure they are adapting to the difference between high school and college work. Checking in, making sure they are staying on track.

Jenny: For Spark, the high school courses, I would log in and watch the submission boxes go from pending to graded. If I saw one stalling for over a week, I'd start nudging. Sometimes the kids were afraid to ask for help, so I'd have to brainstorm the assignments with them to get them going.

Allison: It mattered for my kids to know there would be oversight. Setting goals, checking in, readjusting as needed. Not assuming they can fully self-direct from setup.

Mary: The oversight is really important, as well as setting expectations upfront but being flexible to change them. I developed an extensive spreadsheet to track everything they were doing.

Kaylee: We actually just started using that spreadsheet organization this week and it has been a huge motivator for my kids to get things done and earn free time.

Re: We have a whiteboard for each kid with their daily assignments listed, which keeps us all on the same page with expectations and deadlines.

### Chapter 6: Closing Thoughts

Speaker 1: I would love to just get any closing thoughts from you that you have to share about our resources, homeroom resources, MyTech High resources - anything left unsaid.

Allison: We've seen a huge increase in curriculum and classes over the four years we've been here. It's amazing because MyTech High is genuinely invested in finding great curriculum to help access for free. They recognize that different kids need different things, so the diversity is wonderful. I love the support.

Kaylee: We were nervous about pulling our kids from public school at first. But I've noticed that since they aren't being held back, they've gotten ahead in subjects they're interested in and passionate about, even with less handholding from me. It's been impressive.

Allison: A couple of my learners have disabilities, and in public school they were left behind. It's really nice here to be able to take the time they need to ensure core concepts are solid before moving forward.

Jenny: For new parents, ask questions on the Facebook group - you can search prior posts for answers to common questions. Attend the webinars. Give yourself and your kids grace as you learn and transition. One of my kids went from a C student to a 4.0 by having his social needs met better through homeschooling.

Mary: We have loved the flexibility MyTech High provides for different learning styles and abilities. As long as steady progress is made, it's okay if they are at different grade levels for each subject, catering to their individual needs.

Speaker 1: Ladies, this has been so valuable. Thank you for sharing your experiences with us.

Speaker 1: Hello everyone.

Speaker 1: I am here with a fantastic group of MiTek High parents and I'm so excited for you to meet them. In a minute, you're gonna get to meet Mary, Kaylee, Allison, and Jenny.

Speaker 1: And today we are discussing our Homer resources and our MI Tech high direct courses. These parents are incredible and they are so experienced with these resources. They just bring a wealth of information and knowledge and tips and we are so excited for you to hear what they have to share.

Speaker 1: We trust that their experiences are gonna guide you and other MyTech high families as you consider which homeroom resources you might wanna use, and also, which MyTech high direct courses will best supplement your students' education.

Speaker 1: So I'm gonna in let each of them introduce themselves. Um, Mary, why don't you start us off? Tell us a little bit about yourself.

Speaker 2 (Mary): So, um, my name is Mary. I have six kids. Um, we started homeschooling when my oldest was, um, actually in kindergarten. We took a couple of years off to do public school and that did not work at all. Um, so then we started homeschooling again in third grade. We've been with MyTech High for about four years and we love it.

Speaker 1: Fantastic. Thank you so much. Kaylee, don't you tell us a little bit about yourself please.

Speaker 3 (Kaylee): Yeah, so my name is Kaylee and we actually just started homeschooling this year. I have three kiddos, um, one's in kindergarten and the other one's in third grade this year. And then, um, we decided to do MTH this year, which was an awesome decision. We love it. Um, and we love the resources you guys have too.

Speaker 1: Yay, we're so thrilled to have you. Allison, will you tell us about yourself please?

Speaker 4 (Allison): Yeah, I'm Allison. I am mom of four. Uh, we've been homeschooling for the last four years. It's been with my tech kai the whole time and we are not tempted to go anywhere else. It has been the perfect fit for our family.

Speaker 1: Gosh, I promise you we're not paying them to say these nice things, but I'm just thrilled. Thanks. Um, re you're up.

Speaker 5 (Re): Well, hello. I'm re and we have been homeschooling for 12 years. I have three students. Um, I've got one currently in first grade, one in eighth grade, and one in 10th grade. So I'm doing elementary, middle, and high school this year. We have been with MyTech High for quite a few years. We moved out of the state and then back again. And part of our reason for moving back was MyTech High. We have just been so appreciative of all the opportunities it provides.

Speaker 1: Well, amazing hats off to you and all of those hats that you juggle every day. That's amazing. Jenny, would you tell us a little bit about yourself please?

Speaker 6 (Jenny): Sure. So as a homeschooling mom, Sorry about that. Uh, I have been on and off homeschooling for 12 years. Um, I tried starting when my oldest was five and um, I've homeschooled in several different states, Arizona, Washington, and Utah. Um, so I've, I know kind of a little bit of everything, but my favorite was always to go with a place where I had more financial resource, resources and support instead of trying to do it all by myself. So that is why I came to my tech high. Um, I pulled all my kids outta school. I think they've been in and out of public schools, right? And I pulled 'em all in 2020. And so I started the fall just carrying all that weight on my shoulders. And then a friend goes, don't you know about my tech high? And I was like, okay, first of all, say that slow. So, and then like, what is this? So I'm very happy to be here to help guide some parents on the journey. Um, this year I have been homeschooling six kids and this, that's the most I've ever homeschooled at one time. Um, first grade through 11th grade. And if it wasn't for some of the homeroom resources in my tech height, I could not have done it because um, if you try to carry all that weight on your shoulders, it's too much. And so my failure as a homeschool mom several times over was trying to carry all the weight and um, uh, try to run my house like a school classroom like that. You just can't do that. So I think first thing any parent has to do is throw all the rules out the window that you know about schooling, and then maybe reevaluate and say, call it home educating because you're not necessarily teaching everything. You're pulling resources through into your home and you're teaching your kids from resources you're bringing in.

Speaker 1: Gosh, what a good word, Jenny. Thank you. And I saw everybody nodding along. Amazing. And that was a perfect segue to talking about our homeroom resources.

Speaker 1: So for those that might be unfamiliar, Homer resources are resources that are available to all of our MyTech High families without being put on their schedule. They are supplemental resources that cover all major subject areas in all grades and are just freely available for you to use as you see fit in your family.

Speaker 1: So would somebody start by just telling us what homeroom resources you have used and how they have helped you or how they've worked with your schooling?

Speaker 3 (Kaylee): Yeah, so, um, me actually, since it's our first year, we decided to try a lot because we wanted to see what was out there and we wanted to explore and understand it. And actually in the process we kind of went towards Study Island, um, while we figured out all these other resources. 'cause Study Island helps teach you, you know, all the grades and stuff. And I thought this will be great while we figure out what we like and what we don't like. And um, but one of the biggest things is us just being able to try these resources has helped us figure out what kind of learners my kids are first off. Because you'll learn that your kids learn in different ways. And so that was huge. And then figuring out which ones we liked and which ones you feel sometimes you feel like certain things, um, fall through the cracks. Like if you do one thing, you find, um, just with all the resources out there that you'll find, oh wait, this didn't go over this, you know, but this goes over this, so let's put these two together and it works for my kids. And so that was kind of what we did is we just tried. I just put together and said, okay, and then we're part of the MTH group and I literally searched in the search bar what people used for homeroom resources and I literally saw what everyone thought was like really good for their homes. And so I made sure to put those in our experimental resources and my kids have loved those. So anyway, it was, that's kind of what we did.

Speaker 1: That's fantastic. Kaylee, I just wanna clarify, do you mean the the Facebook group? The My Tech High Facebook group? Yes, the My Tech High Facebook group. Yes, sorry. No, that's my tech high Facebook group.

Speaker 2 (Mary): So when we started MyTech High, uh, we actually started in the middle of the year because we were doing an online curriculum for that first half of the year. We did a lot of experimenting as well to figure out what curriculum worked. And I think that was one of the most important phases of, um, of that transition was the most important homeroom resource is the one that works best for your kid. And um, if they don't like it, they're not going to learn from it as well and they're just going to, it's just gonna be a fight. So I make a point to make sure that my kids get to choose a lot of the things that they do as much as I can. Obviously you have to cover the basics, but if something isn't working, then you switch out for something that does.

Speaker 1: Love it. Thank you. Mary re go ahead.

Speaker 5 (Re): So one of our most favorite homeroom resources has been BrainPOP. And I especially love that because, um, whatever we're using or whatever we're studying in our other curriculum, I'm able to do a quick little type in there and, um, find a video that correlates with what we're learning. And so that gives me kind of something, especially for my younger students to do while I'm working with my older. So for example, like we were learning about parts of the plant today, it was like, oh, it'd be a brain pot video about that. And so that's 10 minutes where I can work with another student, um, while he's still doing something productive. So we've just found BrainPOP has been great for that and so has generation Genius, like those have both been two kind of, or if we're not feeling very well, um, that's just something we can just kind of lightly do, um, just to keep our, our brains and our minds busy.

Speaker 1: Love it. Thank you. Allison. Go ahead.

Speaker 4 (Allison): Just wanna give permission to parents that a lot of these resources are used in public schools the same, there's crossover. And so some of these, we were using them when my kids were in public school and my kids were not successful, but I felt because I was coming from that, that world that we needed to continue on 'cause they were in the middle of the programs. So I just wanna give parents permission to say, if it's not working, do cut it. Even if you're halfway through the year, halfway through, just stop. And there is another resource. So for instance, my kids had used DreamBox and Lexia in their public schools and it was, it was not going well. But when we were able to open up resources with MyTech High Math Seeds and reading eggs ended up being a perfect transition for them and was engaging and met them where they were, same type of content, different approach, suddenly my kids were engaged.

Speaker 1: Amazing. Yeah, I can, I can go That one. Um, that we Road to success is something that you can get in a public school setting or some sort of reading tracker. I know our public library uses it as well, but um, I found that once the kids are about fourth or fifth grade, if they can do it independently, my life is easier. And that's about the time they can record their own reading. And so because they're recording it and they get to choose their prizes, they get a lot more ownership in the reading and that's about the time that kids are popping and starting to actually enjoy reading. Anyway, we really liked that one. I love that. Um, and Generation Genius and mystery science covered my lack of caring about science, right? I just don't love science, I dunno how to teach it. And so I just putting that on there, the kids would love it to the point where Generation Jane just became such a favorite. They're like, mommy, can you go buy the, the kits, the science kits that go with this? And so then I'd use my funds to go buy that because that's where they were showing me they were interested in going. Um, but you know, there were some that just didn't pop, like there really love music and we've got music lessons, so hey, let's do Music Quest. And that one just didn't work out for them. Their brains didn't love that particular resource. Um, but let's see if there was anything else. Oh, the, uh, exact Path and Study Island, those were our like play programs, not necessarily to help them so much with learning the information but supplementing the information.

Speaker 1: Love it. Thank you so much.

Speaker 1: So let's shift gears a little bit to some of those MI tech high direct courses. So these are some that fulfilled, um, a period on your students' schedule. I think all of you has have used them. So what I'd first like to know, uh, is a little bit about the decision process. Obviously there's a custom built option. What made you decide to go with a MiTek High direct course? How did you decide which one to choose?

Speaker 5 (Re): So we, this was kind of our first experience using a MiTek high direct course, but we chose it for my oldest son who is in 10th grade to do the Ignite Program. So this would fulfill his entire schedule, which was, um, a big decision because that was a lot of funding to go towards one program, but we were just very excited about the opportunity for him to, um, work towards his associate's degree. So it's worked out wonderfully. Um, I know it does, so it takes all your funds and your tech fund, but when you do the math on it, it is a huge, huge savings. So we did, um, I started him in 10th grade with the courses and his first semester he took two classes and then his second semester he took three. And it has been, it's been a great experience. Some classes have been, um, a lot easier than other classes. Um, some have been more difficult. We've learned really good communication skills with our professor and how to assert yourself respectfully. Um, but it's been great and I, we will definitely continue using it. I am going to have my ninth grader start. He is going to just do a custom built, so he is just gonna take one class his first semester. Um, and then once he's gonna be taking a few more, we'll do a full, a full schedule for him for that as well.

Speaker 6 (Jenny): Um, so we did the in-person makerspace option at one point. Um, there, that one was, um, great and not great at the same time. So it was great for anyone who needs an unstructured ability to just explore all the different technology resources in one setting. The not great part is my kids like to be assigned something and kind of shown how to create it and they don't do that. They just leave it wide open for creativity of the individual child as they come in work on that. So that was a little harder for my kids, but they at least got to explore several different options in both technology, like 3D machines, but also just woodworking. Short of that, then we also did the Spark program for my high schoolers and that's where I would say it was home educating, right? I brought the program in and they did it and I had different kids working on it, um, who have different abilities in the way their brains work and they were all successful. My caveat on that one was we did not do it for credit for graduation. We, um, did the non-credit seeking, which allowed them to take the time they needed in the courses, but in their case they were all, because it wasn't a four-credit option, it wasn't automatically added seven seven classes to their schedule. We could just do four classes at a time or three classes at a time or mid-year ago. Things are going so well, why don't we add that technology class? And for us it meant processing, you know, two years of English in one year, leaving us open to do more next year in a different way with Spark. So we really like Spark.

Speaker 4 (Allison): We, my oldest did a web design class and we put her in the class because it's something that I'm not confident in teaching. Uh, the technology piece is outside of, of my skillset. So we were relying on that direct course to help us out with that. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good fit and that was what we learned is that you, your kids can benefit from having somebody in the real world to help them through some of those tricky lessons or explaining. And when we would reach out to the teacher that had done the videos, he, he was helpful, but it would've been more helpful to have some type of in-person or, or an option to do like biweekly or weekly Zoom classes so that he can answer in real time.

Speaker 2 (Mary): Um, so I have, um, having more kids could be particularly helpful with that if you have the option or if there's a buddy that they can buddy up with, um, you know, from another family. But when we, when we choose the resources, we've done a lot of, um, uh, of, you know, the MyTech High courses and um, I usually have multiple kids enrolled in the same course so that they can help each other out if they get stuck. This past year, two of my kids were in the Python course and there were a few times when they would get a little frustrated with the assignments because they were tricky. And if you get, you know, one little symbol or letter off, then it's the nature of Python, right? Um, but because they had a sibling there who was taking the class with them, it made a really big difference. Um, so I, I don't know if you wanna talk about all the ones that we've done because we've done a ton of them. Uh, but this past year, you know, where I, my oldest was doing, um, my second to the oldest was doing the computer science course and then the younger two were doing, um, Minecraft, the Minecraft course. And so when they, they got to talk to each other a lot when they were taking the course and another year, um, the older kids were taking aerospace fundamentals and the younger ones were taking rocketry foundations, which ended up being very complimentary, um, so that we could go out and do a lot of activities that ended up being fun for both and stuff like that. So if it's possible to, to buddy up with another family or a sibling

Sure, here's the next section:

Speaker 1: So we're kind of on this track, but let me ask a little bit more specifically. Can you think of any resources that have been just a home run for your families that have been just the perfect thing at the perfect time? And then just to start you thinking the next question is going to be the opposite of that. Which ones have you tried that have just not worked out for whatever reason?

Speaker 4 (Allison): Mystery science, hands down has been phenomenal for my family. They have, they have loved it and they're on it frequently. They talk about the lessons, it's completely independent learning. I am not involved in it at all other than to hear the fun facts that they've learned. But mystery science has been very engaging and very intuitive for the kids to use and has led to some really great discussions. Um, generation, generation genius for the same exact reasons. Those two things have just been really engaging and fun for the kids. And then as family, we've enjoyed those.

Speaker 3 (Kaylee): I was actually gonna say, so my kids, they beg for mystery science, they love it and I was surprised. So when we first, um, requested it and I first got on because I like to see what they're doing, we did the first lesson together and it was the earthquake lesson and they have you print off the little house and you see what happens to the house as the earthquake hits and then you have to figure out how to be an engineer. So it was like an engineer mixed with, you know, like technology mixed with with science. It was so cool. And then they had to figure out how to, you know, make the, the house not fall down. And my kids, all three of 'em loved it. So they beg for mystery science all the time. I also wanted to say, so kind of like with Jenny actually, she talked about Music Quest. We tried Music Quest as well, and I'm actually a piano teacher. Um, and so I thought Music Quest will be so awesome, like they won't need my help, like, because you're always helping them practice and all these things. And I was like, we'll just do Music Quest. And my kids actually had a really hard time with that and they've been taking piano for a long time. Um, they had a hard time moving the little, uh, and I know a lot of parents really like Music Quest, but it, but my kids had a very hard time with it and I'm not sure if it was just 'cause it was different than what they were used to with a piano teacher in the house. It probably didn't help. But, um, but yeah, so if, if I could talk about my least favorite, that would probably be my kids' least favorite was Music Quest.

Speaker 5 (Re): We uh, echoing the rest, mystery science has been great. BrainPOP generation genius. We also, when um, towards the end of the year if we finish up curriculum, that's when we have started using Steady Island as kind of a, let's make sure all the boxes have kind of been checked, that our curriculum has covered everything that it needs to cover. And so that has been, I think, um, great for us and for Ignite our home run classes were psychology and history. And what I loved most about psychology was it was a topic that was out of my comfort zone and my son loved it and now he is excited and considering that for a minor. So I'm so appreciative that he had someone else who had the expertise to kind of share that love with him.

Speaker 1: Okay, we hear you. Thanks for that Jenny. Anybody else have any home runs or any doubts for your family that you wanna share about?

Speaker 2 (Mary): So, um, a a lot of the game-based learning ones they particularly enjoyed and um, a lot of the time we just used them as a reinforcement. They weren't the main part of the curriculum, but some things get a little monotonous without a little bit of a game involved. That's why things like, um, math Prodigy, they've enjoyed. Sometimes they get a little distracted with Math Prodigy though, so you have to make sure they're on track. But it's really good for helping, um, with those problems that you have to do again and again and again in order to get proficient at it. Um, the ones that didn't work well, we dropped pretty quickly, so I, I'm actually having a hard time remembering what they were. Um, but the, you know, they loved Generation Genius and they absolutely loved Kiwi crates. Uh, we had, um, the different levels there with Kiwi crates and anything, you know, um, game-based learning, they particularly enjoyed math. Seeds worked pretty well too, um, when they were younger.

Speaker 4 (Allison): My kids also really liked Imagine Math. They've enjoyed that, felt very video game esque and they thought it was really fun. They felt like they were playing video games instead of instead of learning. And since we don't have a lot of video games in our house, they were super engaged in Imagine Math. Um, my right was not a great fit. The way that the AI was, was designed. Um, it made it difficult to, to do well in because you weren't exactly sure what they were looking for, what the a what the program was looking for. So maybe that's something that has been changed over time. We haven't used it in about a year or two, but that was really difficult because we felt like we weren't sure what the goal was and it wasn't super clear.

Speaker 1: Okay. Good word. Thanks so much Alison. I have one more and that was own it. It's good for older kids and it's only one time through. You don't really need to go in and repeat. Um, it's just a great responsibility teaching piece.

Speaker 1: Let's shift gears just a little bit. I would love to know if there's any programs in particular that have helped one of your students in an area of struggle for them That could be academically, that could be, gosh, this subject didn't go well in public school, but for whatever reason it went really well when we pulled them. Um, are there any resources that helped in an area of struggle?

Speaker 6 (Jenny): We really liked the Spark English language programs. That was huge. Um, when I pulled my kids out of middle school, I was, I, I looked at the writing and I was like, I don't know how your teachers were ever approved of that writing, but that's just crap and we're not gonna do crap at my house. And so at least as the um, eng the Spark English language, it teaches them, you know, the proper grammar and structure as well as writing a paper so that I could then be the supporter instead of the teacher because kids respond better when they have an actual teacher grading their stuff and not mom. So that was a really big help for us.

Speaker 1: Fantastic. Anybody else? Has there been anything in particular that's helped with an area of struggle?

Speaker 1: Okay, I would love to shift and talk a little bit about parent involvement. I think Allison, you mentioned that with mystery science of I love that I can just open it up and off they go 'cause sometimes we all need that. So I'd love to know about any of the resources you wanna talk about in terms of parent involvement. Which ones have been just open and go for your students? Which ones have needed a little bit more of oversight from you?

Speaker 5 (Re): So with Ignite, it is definitely, um, open and go like a, I mean it's been created by a professor. This is a college level course. I do have to say that my students, um, well being in 10th grade, he still kind of needed some guidance. There was definitely kind of a learning curve. Again, learning how to communicate with a professor, um, having a peer or in this case a, a parent, um, checking your work. Um, I think that it was like, I, I wouldn't say it's just handed off. I mean for the right student and maybe for older students they would be totally able to do that. But I do have to say I still think you need kind of a parent checking in, making sure that they're adapting to the difference between high school work and college work. Um, so while it is open and go for the student, I think there just needs to be a little oversight on the parent. And I think that as my student grows, he'll learn how to do that more. But um, again, everything is is done but I, I still think they might need just little nudges or just making sure that they're staying on track. 'cause again, it's college classes, you can't, um, can't mess that up. Those are gonna stick with you if, if that does happen. So it's, I'd say it's like more oversight and um, just encouragement on the side.

Speaker 6 (Jenny): Uh, so I again just 'cause I loved Spark and it was high schoolers and it was their full schedule. Um, I would log into their accounts and I would watch these little boxes turn green from submission in this magenta color to green when it was graded and they've got a grade. And so I'm watching it and as you're transitioning kids who are maybe older who've been, you know, middle school or high school and you're actually home teaching them now, um, I would, as soon as that box had sat there for like a week and now we're going on two weeks and there's no progression, I'd start to nudge and say, hey, it's okay. And um, what I've noticed, at least at our house, and maybe this will be helpful for other people, is that the kids were afraid to tell me that they didn't understand and they would get defensive instead of ask questions on how, because sometimes in the school system, if you ask too many questions you get yelled at, like you gotta just know. So I was, I would always say, no, I'm here to help you. And so usually it always came up to essay writing and there's a lot of essays to write through those courses. And so I'd say, okay, we have to sit down and brainstorm this and sometimes I would have to just brainstorm in the car while we're driving, tell me about that assignment. Well have you thought about this or this? And suddenly the brainstorm gets ed juices flowing and they knock out those assignments real fast. Or I'll see them stall and say, you know, while you're thinking about that assignment, why don't you go do the next one and the next one and the next lesson. So you're getting ahead on lessons and then you'll come back and finish all the assignments and then they're like, oh great, I saw progress, I saw more green boxes pop up. Now I can go back and do those assignments and finish it up and they don't feel like they're stalling their course moving forward.

Speaker 4 (Allison): I think that for us it mattered for my kids to know that there would be oversight and to know that I was there to help. So at the beginning with no matter which curriculum we've pulled out, it's, it's setting a goal early on, it looks like you'll need to complete X amount of steps. Uh, we're gonna get you logged in, we're gonna set that up. We're going to maybe do a couple lessons at the beginning, see if you have any questions, see if you understand how to do it, step back, see if they can be independent depending on their age, age appropriate. And then letting them know, hey, I'm able to see when you're progressing and when you're not, I'm checking in with you and then helping them as needed and not assuming that they're doing it on their own because you set it up so now you're good. Um, but, but checking in with them to make sure that those things are being completed with the goals that you set at the beginning of the year and if you didn't readjusting those goals as you go.

Speaker 2 (Mary): Um, yeah, I agree that the oversight is a really, really important and also, um, knowing what the expectations are when you start. But as Allison said, being flexible enough to change those as needed when the kids don't feel like they, um, are gonna have to check in with anyone. Sometimes they do just kind of, um, brush over things or they don't want to deal with it because it can be a tricky concept. At first, I tried to keep track of a lot of that in my head and it was not working at all. So I developed a rather extensive spreadsheet in order to keep track of everything that they were doing. That way when they challenged me on it, they're like, no, I did this. I could go back and say, Nope, it's right here on the spreadsheet, this is where you're at.

Speaker 3 (Kaylee): I actually, so when we first started this year, um, I, you know, we, we did all the experimenting and stuff, but then we started figuring out a guideline and I don't know if you were the one that put that on the MTH Facebook group Mary, but we found that spreadsheet, that spreadsheet organization and it has been, we actually just started it this week and my kids, oh my goodness, it has just been, you know, if you get this all done, you get a, you get a play, you get a free time, you get to do what you want. Um, and it has been a huge motivator for my kids and one of 'em, he'll get up at five 30 in the morning so he gets done earlier than everybody else so that he can do his play time. But just having that list there so that I make sure we hit everything that we need to hit and that the kids are on the same page as me has really just been a lifesaver. So I don't know if that was you, but the parent involvement is huge. Um, and the more you can make it simple for yourself, especially with multiple kids, the easier it gets.

Speaker 2 (Mary): It, it wasn't me, but I do have a similar one.

Speaker 5 (Re): Yeah, kind of piggybacking off that, we have like a whiteboard and each kid has their own category and each day I do write down like what their assignments are and so that's kind of me staying on track of it and then not having to do any, um, follow up or nagging or they just know clear expectations I think are sometimes the key to the success in these programs is that they know what they're doing. Um, we're, you know, that once and then once they're done, they're done. And it also keeps track of times and deadlines and yeah, I think that putting in the work to do it definitely pays off in the long run because then we have really successful days.

Speaker 1: Well ladies, that is my list of questions for the moment, but I would love to just get any closing thoughts from you that you have to share. You do not have to, but if there's anything else that you're feeling is left unsaid, um, this is your moment about any of our resources, homeroom resources, MyTech, high resources, anything.

Speaker 4 (Allison): Just one thing. So because we've been here over the four years, we've seen just a, a huge increase in curriculum and classes and it's been amazing because I feel like Miek High is genuinely invested in finding really great curriculum for, to help us access for free, to be able to help our kids. And, and I feel like Miek High recognizes that because there are such different learners, one thing is gonna be the the bee's knees for one and there'll be something else for another. And I, I love that. I love the support, I love the diversity of curriculum. It feels accessible.

Speaker 3 (Kaylee): Yeah, so, um, something I have noticed, um, we were really nervous about pulling our kids out of public school like every other mother would be. Um, but one thing I noticed, one of my children was starting to get ahead in school and we were actually talking to the principal about maybe moving her ahead of grade 'cause she was doing so well and they actually said they didn't prefer that, which, you know, I can kind of understand their viewpoint, but since we have pulled her out of school and, and my other two kids actually, they have all been at least ahead in one subject or another, um, because they're not being held back. And that was something too that was just really neat, um, to see, you know, just let my kids do what they they're interested in, you know, and then doing all their other stuff that they need to do too, but letting them focus on what they want to do extra. And they've, it's been impressive actually with even less mother help in that area because they love it so much. They're doing this program they love and they just keep getting ahead and I'm just thinking, wow, this is, this is incredible. You know, things I never would've thought would've happened and it's just been surprising.

Speaker 4 (Allison): Yeah, so we, along with Kaylee, a couple of my learners have some learning disabilities and what has been equally wonderful is in school they were left behind and when we tried to get help and assistance for them, the exact opposite of Kaylee, they said, well, everybody else is moving forward so your child has to move forward. It's really nice to be able to take the time to make sure those core concepts are solid so that they can continue building their knowledge base and, and educationally and academically. So whether your children are moving forward at a fantastic rate or whether they need that additional help, that's what's so great about this program is that you can tailor it directly to their needs. Just can't say enough good about it. It's fantastic.

Speaker 6 (Jenny): So one thing that a new parent is gonna find, um, even a seasoned parent like me was whenever you're starting to look at the reimbursement process, asking questions on the Facebook group is enormously helpful. Um, searching your questions on the Facebook group, you're gonna get so many posts where other people have asked the same question and you can just search through all the comments and just start to mine out, you know, the answers that you're looking for. So I think that's particularly helpful. Um, the webinars that they do, uh, twice a week are helpful to get on and just get clarification on things. Um, but for a parent to sit back and go, there's gotta be lots of grace for me and my kids as we learn and process and even as a seasoned parent, like, oh, we're up against something that's new for us, so let's just take a breath and take it slow and we'll get through it. Um, one thing I found for my kids, um, that transition from struggling to success was one of my kids came, you know, from home, from school to home education and I did not know, and he didn't know at the time that he had a social battery that got drained so quick at school that he had nothing emotionally to give his schoolwork. And so we, he still goes for those two classes he can go to school for, um, and still attend my tech high and that that utilizes enough of his social battery that he still has more to give his schoolwork. So he went from being a c student at school to now being an a 4.0 student and his mental health has improved as well as his grades. And so it's been huge just to see that transition. 'cause so many people are concerned about that social aspect. Um, but you have to remember that kids in this world, they're gonna be social no matter what. Right? All you have to do is go to the grocery store once a week and you've got tons of social going on. But um, you just have to remember that it's, that's not the end all be all. Um, sometimes the social is literally can you get along with your family on a daily basis when you're gonna be your worst. And then as you grow in, I can be kind and happy most of the day. It that is more character development than, you know, social school all the time.

Speaker 2 (Mary): We have loved having the flexibility that we get through my tech high and, um, it's made a huge difference to our kids that have different learning styles and abilities. Um, as long as they are making steady progress, they're fine. It's okay if they're in one grade, in one subject and in an entirely different one in another. It's, um, it's about where they're at and catering things to their needs in each individual subject.

Speaker 1: Well ladies, this has been so valuable. Thank you so much for sharing your time and your experiences with us. I have so appreciated it and I know that our other MyTech high families will as well.

## What Parents Say About My Tech High

Speaker 1: My Tech has focused on technology that has truly changed our family and our focus for the future. It's so exciting to see the many options they have and that they're succeeding at it. Our oldest son at this point has had a bit of an internship where he got to actually participate with some robotic drone type programming and some of the basics of the building and building prototypes. I enjoy the opportunity to have different curriculums I can use that address their individual needs, their individual learning styles, and prepare them for the future as they envision for themselves.

Speaker 2: The tech classes have been wonderful. It has opened up doors and taught them things that they would never have pursued on their own.

Speaker 3: We are able to go on field trips and do lots of fun things because of the resources that we've been given through My Tech. Our children are very unique; they need their own personalized education so that they can be learning the things that are pertinent to them. We love the My Tech program because it gives us the funds to do these things, which with a tight budget and a large family, we wouldn't be able to do otherwise. It has really benefited our family. It has been a great opportunity. We've been able to do lots of fun things as a family because of this program, and it helps them to learn and grow when they're learning about what they want to learn about.

Speaker 4: We have loved being involved in this program because of the freedom of choice it gives the kids in choosing what they want to study and how they want to study it. It also gives them amazing technology skills that they can use while they're studying things like history or math or any of the liberal arts. It really helps integrate those with technology so that they're not just really well educated, but they have the skills that they're going to need to work in today's world and to be able to perform really well. Giving the children freedom in their education to, instead of being completely standardized, being very individualized for them has really helped keep them inspired, motivated, and eager to learn and explore. It's also given us so much more time to read. We save so much time as a family because all of our schoolwork gets done with guidance from excellent mentors throughout the day, and we don't have to spend our evenings doing a bunch of worksheets.

Speaker 5: Again, it provides those resources that allow us to tailor as to what that child needs best, and they're most excited to be able to do it. All of my kids are enrolled in the My Tech High program.

## What Students Say

Here is the transcript with improved spelling and grammar, and segments merged by speaker:

Speaker 1: This is one of my circuits from my circuitry class. I built a screw press; it's pretty cool. I'm six years old, and I am in their computer programming class, stop motion animation. It's really cool. It's where you take pictures and put it into a video. I really like this book because I designed it myself, and it has real chains in it.

Speaker 2: I've been able to learn all sorts of C and C++ programming, getting to learn how to work with different computer operating systems, navigate and manipulate them at a very fundamental level. My internship has been with a company up in Logan, in the area of robotics. Basically, they work on building and designing different drones and flying robots. My Tech High allows me to be able to personalize and customize what I want to learn, you know, and do the things that I want to do so that I can prepare for my future all better.

Speaker 3: In the Minecraft programming course, I've learned how to use variables and make tools and armor. This has taught me several skills. For example, if I wanted to fix computers, then I could probably program a game or an app that helps fix that.

Speaker 4: I am 12, and he is 10. We built this crown lathe. I am currently taking an HTML course where I learn how to program websites. I'm enjoying it; it's a fun course. I'm currently teaching a little class, working on Java programming, modding Minecraft, and a Lego robotics class. I learned how to program, build, and tell robots what to do. In my electricity course, I learned how to make circuits to make different sounds with the speaker, make a fan blow, and other fun stuff like that.

Speaker 5: I'm in the entrepreneurial class in My Tech High, and it's teaching me how to save money and how to start a business. I'm learning technology and WordPress, and right now, I'm programming a website for a school in Nepal. The My Tech High program helps me take theater. I really like theater, and because of My Tech High, I can go more into depth and study more things that I want to know about. I really love working on real-world projects that are helping other people. It helps me see that my education is actually going to be able to help not just me, but people around me.

Speaker 6: I love the freedom that My Tech High gives me to take the classes I want to take. This is really helping me set and actually visualize my future goals.

Speaker 7: I've learned lots of animation, like stop motion animation. I really enjoyed it. We got to do claymation; it's really fun.

Unknown Speaker: My Tech High is fun.
