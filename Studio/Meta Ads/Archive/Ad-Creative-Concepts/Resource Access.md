**Instagram Comment:**

```
Wish we could afford all the cool homeschool stuff I see online. Pinterest vs reality is too real 😂

```

**Voiceover Script (Conversational):**
"Okay but for real though! I was saving all these Pinterest ideas I could never actually afford. Then another mom told me about OpenEd. Now my kids use ALL the resources—that expensive science curriculum, art classes, even those coding toys—without wrecking our budget. Their public school partnership thing makes it possible. Super easy to apply too. My only regret is not finding this sooner!"
