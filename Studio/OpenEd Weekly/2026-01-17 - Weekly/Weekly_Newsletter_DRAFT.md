## DEEP DIVE: The Charlotte Mason Method

In the late 1800s, as England built its first compulsory education system, a Victorian educator named Charlotte Mason gave parents something radical: permission to trust themselves.

The message of compulsory schooling was clear - leave teaching to the professionals. Mason disagreed. Children are born persons, she argued, not blank slates waiting for experts to inscribe knowledge. They're capable of engaging with real ideas from the start. And parents who know their children are capable of guiding that journey.

Mason wrote six volumes on education and founded the Parents' National Educational Union, but she never created a curriculum. A Google search for "Charlotte Mason curriculum" returns millions of results today - detailed book lists, year-by-year schedules, guides insisting you *must* read Plutarch. These can be helpful starting points. But they're interpretations of Mason's philosophy, not the philosophy itself.

Plutarch himself would probably object to being made mandatory reading. The quote often attributed to him - "the mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled" - captures the spirit Mason was after. Not a checklist to complete, but a fire to tend.

Her core principles share more in common with open education than with any packaged curriculum: the world is the best classroom, you don't need to get everything from one place, and children learn best when they're genuinely engaged with real ideas.

## DAY IN THE LIFE: Charlynn Chambers, Oregon

Charlynn Chambers homeschools four kids in Oregon, ranging from preschool to middle school. She doesn't try to replicate a classroom at her kitchen table. No bells. No doing every subject every day. Instead, her family operates off a "menu."

The moment that stood out: **Dad Skills.**

"One of the specific items on our weekly menu is 'Dad Skills,'" Charlynn explains. "My husband is handy - woodworking, resin, fixing cars. We want our kids to learn that solving problems with your hands is just as important as solving them with a pencil."

On a recent Tuesday, the family was building a shop. The kids helped frame the rafters while her husband showed them how to nail wood together. Suddenly, they were calculating angles and counting similar sides - a geometry lesson disguised as construction.

"He didn't even realize he was teaching math," Charlynn says. "I walked out and said, 'You guys are doing Dad Skills right now.'"

Her philosophy in one line: *We fit the school to the life, not the life to the school.*

## Trends We're Following

**Oklahoma moves to close homeschool loophole**

[The Black Chronicle reports](https://blackchronicle.com/education/homeschool-proposal-closing-exploited-loophole-unanimously-advances/) that an Oklahoma bill closing a homeschool registration loophole advanced unanimously. The takeaway for OpenEd families: legitimate homeschoolers have nothing to fear from accountability measures that target bad actors. Well-designed oversight protects the freedom of families who are actually educating their kids.

**School choice is forcing schools to compete on customer service**

[The 74 found](https://www.the74million.org/article/as-school-choice-programs-grow-parents-are-demanding-better-customer-service/) that as choice programs expand, parents are demanding something schools rarely provided: responsiveness. When families can leave, schools have to listen. This is the market pressure traditional education has avoided for decades. It's arriving now.

**The "a la carte education" accountability problem**

[Fordham Institute wrestles](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/la-carte-education-accountability-conundrum) with a genuine tension: as families mix and match providers - some tutoring here, some classes there - who's responsible for outcomes? OpenEd's answer: the family is. We provide tools and access. Parents remain the primary educators. That's the whole point.

**What does "normal" even mean?**

[Austin Scholar's latest](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-199-what-does-it-mean) explores why we measure kids against a fictional average. The "normal" child is a statistical construct, not a real person. Homeschoolers figured this out years ago: you teach the child in front of you, not the grade-level benchmark.

**EdWeek's 7 trends for 2026**

[Market Brief's annual forecast](https://marketbrief.edweek.org/education-market/whats-next-7-key-trends-to-watch-in-the-education-market-in-2026/2025/12) is out. Worth scanning if you want to know where the money is flowing. Short version: AI tutoring, microschools, and parent-directed spending are all accelerating. The institutions are noticing what families already know.

Honeycutt's research-backed but accessible approach has earned her a devoted following. If you have littles, worth a look.

**[Why boredom is good](https://dralizapressman.substack.com/p/why-boredom-is-good-and-how-to-encourage)** - Dr. Aliza Pressman makes the case for letting kids be bored. The impulse to fill every moment with stimulation backfires. Boredom is where creativity and self-direction begin.

## Ed's Stable

Remember that [parrot puzzle](https://opened.co/blog/a-parrot-a-man-and-the-point-of-algebra) we posted on Facebook? A pirate with a parrot on his head - combined height 200 cm. Standing side by side, the difference is 170 cm. How tall is the parrot?

The answer: **15 centimeters.**

But the interesting part wasn't the math. It was watching adults struggle with Algebra 1. Two equations, two unknowns - the kind of problem we spent years drilling in school. And yet most people either reached for ChatGPT, guessed, or scrolled past.

Maybe our mental muscles are atrophying. Or maybe we never really learned it in the first place. We memorized steps for a test but never learned to *see* the structure of a problem.

Isaac Morehouse put it this way: "Algebra is about figuring out puzzles when you don't have all the pieces. I loved solving for X, as long as it was the X-Wing spacecraft."

If your kid is anywhere near algebra, hand them this puzzle at dinner. Don't help. Let them sit with it. If they're stuck: "What do you know? What don't you know?" If they're *really* stuck: "What happens if you add those two things together?"

That last nudge is the whole lesson.
