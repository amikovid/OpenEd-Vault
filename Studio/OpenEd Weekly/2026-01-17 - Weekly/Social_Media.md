## 4.2 Ed's Roundup X Thread (10 tweets)

### Tweet 1: Hook
```
Ed's Roundup: What 10K+ readers of OpenEd Weekly are paying attention to this week

Charlotte Mason's radical idea
An algebra puzzle that broke adults
Congress defending homeschoolers

10 creators. 1 thread. 🐴

(thread)
```

### Tweet 2: Charlotte Mason Deep Dive
```
In the 1800s, Charlotte Mason told parents something radical:

You don't need experts to teach your children. Your kids are already capable of engaging with real ideas.

She wrote 6 volumes. Never created a curriculum.

The philosophy, not the book list, is the point.

```

### Tweet 3: Sonya Shafer Quote
```
"It's very common for a child to be ready for third-grade math while working on first-grade reading skills. That's fine!"

— @SCMason

Charlotte Mason figured this out a century ago: teach the child, not the grade level.
```

### Tweet 4: Charlynn Chambers / Day in Life
```
Charlynn Chambers homeschools 4 kids in Oregon.

She doesn't do every subject every day. She runs on weekly quotas.

One menu item: "Dad Skills"

Her husband was teaching geometry while building a shop. He didn't even know it.

https://opened.co/blog/charlynn-chambers-day-in-the-life
```

### Tweet 5: Congress Bill
```
The Homeschool Graduation Recognition Act just passed committee 33-0.

It ends discrimination against homeschoolers applying to college.

No more excessive documentation. No more extra testing.

Equal treatment under the law. @HSLDA backs it.
```

### Tweet 6: Matt Bateman / Austin Scholar
```
The kid who memorizes Pokemon types, evolution chains, and battle strategies?

That's scholarly work.

@mbateman argues we've normalized dysfunction in kids. A healthy elementary student develops research agendas that span months.

@AustinScholar_ breaks it down:

```

### Tweet 7: Claire Honeycutt
```
"Preschool isn't about covering content. It's about shaping a relationship with learning."

@HippyMomPhD on the early years:

- Read classics from the beginning
- Let kids memorize what they love
- Add poetry early
- Protect unstructured play

```

### Tweet 8: Decision Fatigue
```
Decision fatigue is wearing down your homeschool.

@SarahMackenzie's fix:

1. Write assignments the night before
2. Create an "Idea Shelf" for curriculum impulses
3. Have kids eat their frogs first

```

### Tweet 9: The Parrot Puzzle
```
A pirate with a parrot on his head.
Combined height: 200 cm.
Standing apart, difference: 170 cm.

How tall is the parrot?

Most adults reached for ChatGPT or scrolled past.

Two equations, two unknowns. Algebra 1.

Maybe we never really learned it.

```

### Tweet 10: Isaac Morehouse Quote + CTA
```
"Algebra is about figuring out puzzles when you don't have all the pieces. I loved solving for X, as long as it was the X-Wing spacecraft."

— @IsaacMorehouse

The answer: 15 cm.

## 4.3 Single-Post Options (Standalone)

### Option A: The Parrot Puzzle (Viral Potential)
```
A pirate stands with a parrot on his head.

Combined height: 200 cm
Standing side by side, difference: 170 cm

How tall is the parrot?

Most adults reached for ChatGPT.

This is Algebra 1. Two equations, two unknowns.

Maybe our mental muscles are atrophying. Or maybe we never really learned it.
```

### Option B: Charlotte Mason Contrarian
```
Charlotte Mason wrote 6 volumes on education.

She never created a curriculum.

A Google search for "Charlotte Mason curriculum" returns millions of results - book lists, schedules, guides insisting you MUST read Plutarch.

Those are interpretations, not the philosophy.

The method is a fire to tend, not a checklist to complete.
```

### Option C: Matt Bateman / Pokemon Take
```
The kid who memorizes Pokemon types, evolution chains, and battle strategies?

That's scholarly work.

The content differs from postcolonial theory. The cognitive processes are identical.

We've normalized disengagement in children and called it "normal development."

It's not.
```

### Option D: Dad Skills
```
"Dad Skills" is on our weekly homeschool menu.

Woodworking. Fixing cars. Building things.

Yesterday, the kids helped frame rafters for a shop.

Calculating angles. Counting similar sides.

Geometry lesson disguised as construction.

He didn't even know he was teaching math.
```
