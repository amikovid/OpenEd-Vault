## LinkedIn Post (Deep Dive Feature)

**Hook:** Michelle Rhee championed college-for-all for two decades. Then she met her 20-something neighbors.

**Body:**
As Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, she believed the formula was simple: rigorous academics, high test scores, four-year degree.

Then she moved to a high-end apartment building in downtown Los Angeles.

Her neighbors - all in their 20s - were out-earning her.

Their jobs? Cannabis retail, crypto trading, and content creation. None of them had majored in any of it. Some hadn't finished college at all.

The playbook has changed:
- Half of college grads work jobs that don't require their diploma
- 10 million unfilled jobs in skilled trades
- For every 5 tradespeople who retire, only 2 enter the workforce

A robot can write an email. It can't snake a clogged drain at 2 AM.

If you're a homeschool parent thinking about what comes after K-12, this week's newsletter breaks down the modern apprenticeship landscape - from CTE programs to youth apprenticeships to online certifications.

Plus: @SmartPathHQ's podcast with college counselor Alison Hamar on how to keep doors open when your teen swears they'll "never go to college."

## Twitter/X Thread (CTE Stats)

**Tweet 1:**
For every 5 tradespeople who retire, only 2 enter the workforce.

The math doesn't add up - literally.

A thread on why "college-for-all" is cracking:

**Tweet 2:**
Michelle Rhee spent 20 years as one of education reform's biggest names.

Then she moved to a fancy LA apartment building.

Her 20-something neighbors were out-earning her in cannabis, crypto, and content creation.

None of them had majored in any of it.

**Tweet 3:**
The numbers from @michaelbhorn:

- Half of college grads work jobs that don't require their diploma
- 10 million unfilled jobs in skilled trades
- Six-figure salaries for work that requires physical presence

**Tweet 4:**
@mikeroweworks calls it a "priorities crisis":

"We lend money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back to train them for jobs that no longer exist."

**Tweet 5:**
The path forward for homeschoolers: exposure, doing, and networks.

- Community college dual enrollment
- Youth apprenticeships
- Online certifications (check out Knowledge Pillars for browser-based tech creds)

**Tweet 6:**
Counterintuitive advice from @KenColeman:

This is the time to identify your kid's "natural edges" and sharpen them into nines and tens.

Getting paid your first dollar for value created > any report card.

**Tweet 7:**
If you're wondering how to actually have the college-vs-career conversation with your teen, @SmartPathHQ just dropped a great podcast episode with college counselor Alison Hamar.

When to start transcripts, how to keep options open, what most homeschool parents overlook.

## Twitter/X Single (Quotable)

**Option A:**
A robot can write an email.

It can't snake a clogged drain at 2 AM or rewire a house.

That's why the trades are hitting six-figure salaries.

**Option B:**
"We lend money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back to train them for jobs that no longer exist." - @mikeroweworks

The priorities crisis is real.

**Option C:**
Getting someone other than family to pay you your first dollar for value created?

That's a milestone worth more than any report card.

## Facebook Post (Community-focused)

We talk a lot about how it takes a village to raise a kid.

But we forget to ask: where's the village?

As OpenEd mom Krisy Shaughnessy put it this week: "If you want to be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager."

That means being the one to pick a park, send the email, and invite others to the messiness of community.

This week's newsletter covers:
- Why "college-for-all" is cracking (and what's replacing it)
- Krisy's "Wonder Wall" strategy for capturing kid curiosity
- A free webinar on going from homeschool chaos to calm
- Tools for career exploration, including @SmartPathHQ for college/career planning

What's one book your family is obsessing over right now? Drop it in the comments - we're building a community reading list for Once Upon a Time Week.
