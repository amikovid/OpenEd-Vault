# OpenEd Weekly: The Modern Apprenticeship

## GREETINGS EDDIES

Happy Friday Eddies!

I hope your week has involved more "aha!" moments than "uh-oh" moments. 

We’re gearing up for a big one next week: **Once Upon a Time Week (Jan 26-30)**. We’re celebrating stories with everything from spelling bees to a live visit from NYT bestselling author Apryl Stott (Some kind of funny parenthetical about what or where people might know her from ).

If your kid has a favorite book they can’t stop talking about (or one you’re secretly tired of reading for the 400th time), [share it with the community here](https://padlet.com/openedcommunity/favoritebooks). We're building a massive collaborative reading list for the week.

A few other community notices for your Friday radar:

1.  **February Club Sign-ups:** They opened this morning in the OpenEd Marketplace <To this OpenEd.co/marketplace >. Whether your teen wants to dive into **Coding**, **Animal Studies**, or just dominate in **LEGO Engineering**, secure your spot before the weekend rush.
2.  **Epic Book Battle:** Our 8-week reading gauntlet for grades 3-8 starts soon (Wednesdays at 1pm MT). If your student likes competition as much as they like chapters, this is their moment.
3.  **Apprentice Energy:** I spent a lot of time this week looking at why "College-for-All" is beginning to crack and what’s taking its place (hint: it involves getting paid to learn). We’ve got a full breakdown of that below.

Whether you're tending to a "Wonder Wall" of sticky notes like OpenEd mom Krisy Shaughnessy (read her Day in the Life below) or just trying to navigate the Friday afternoon chaos, I'm glad you're here.

Now let’s dive in.

## DEEP DIVE: Apprenticeships, CTE, and Real-World Learning for Teens

Michelle Rhee spent two decades as one of the most prominent defenders of the "college-for-all" mission <I don't know if this is quite accurate - There's some way that we could maybe kind of broaden this. Let's do a little search and test and see if this is true >. As the Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, she believed the formula was simple: rigorous academics, high test scores, and a four-year degree. 

Years later, after moving into a high-end apartment building in downtown Los Angeles, she realized her neighbors—all in their 20s—were out-earning her in jobs like cannabis, crypto, and content creation. Jobs for which there is no college major. <This whole thing needs polish here.>

The [playbook has fundamentally changed](https://opened.co/blog/college-for-all-is-breaking-what-replaces-it). According to research by Michael Horn, college success rates are lower than most parents realize, with half of all graduates working jobs that don't even require their diploma. Meanwhile, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports over 10 million unfilled jobs in skilled trades. We are currently facing what *Dirty Jobs* host Mike Rowe calls a priorities crisis, where we "lend money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back to train them for jobs that no longer exist."

Modern Career and Technical Education (CTE) is one sane alternative. It covers everything from robotics and cybersecurity to HVAC and construction management. For every five tradespeople who retire, only two enter the workforce. A robot might be able to write an email, but it can't snake a clogged drain at 2 AM or rewire a house. These [essential roles are hitting six-figure salaries](https://opened.co/blog/why-the-trades-pay-6-figures) because they require physical presence and human judgment.

The path forward for homeschoolers is flexible. Whether it's [community college dual enrollment](https://opened.co/blog/apprenticeships-cte-guide), youth apprenticeships, or online certifications, the goals are threefold: 
1. exposure, 2. doing, and 3. networks. 

Our guide also contains a counterintuitive suggestion from career expert <and Rasmey network host...> Ken Coleman notes, this is the time to identify a child's "natural edges" and sharpen them into nines and tens. Getting someone other than family to pay you your first dollar for value created is a milestone worth more than a report card. <<SMOOTH IT OUT>>

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: A Day in the Life of an Accidental Homeschooler

Ela recently sat down with OpenEd mom Krisy Shaughnessy to discuss how a pandemic-era pivot turned into a permanent love for "unschooling with intention." Shaughnessy, a mom of two competitive soccer players, focuses on the relationship and connection over rigid academic checklists. She’s found that "sneaking learning into play"—like using math games instead of workbooks—keeps the curiosity alive.

"It's kind of like when you put vegetables in food," Shaughnessy explains. "There's some veggies you can blend up that's totally unnoticeable. They thought it was this privilege that they were getting extra screen time, and they didn't realize they were just solving math equations." She also shares her "Wonder Wall" strategy, where kids place sticky notes with their random daily questions to be researched later, validating their curiosity without interrupting the mother-as-teacher flow. <insert oasis joke here annd tease her full Day in the Life guest article>

## Trends We're Following

**Google and Khan Academy Team Up for AI Coaching**
A new [partnership between Google and Khan Academy](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/education/khan-academy-partnership/) is bringing Gemini-powered "Writing Coaches" to students. Unlike typical AI that just spits out a finished essay, this tool guides students through outlining and drafting, focusing on the process of learning rather than just delivering a product. <add joke here>

**Maine Blends Math with the Real World**
A [new initiative in Maine](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/02/nx-s1-5611192/in-maine-a-new-initiative-is-helping-students-connect-math-with-the-real-world) is helping students connect algebra and geometry to hands-on projects. By moving away from abstract worksheets and toward career-ready math, the state aims to fix stagnant post-pandemic scores through immediate relevance.

**The Rise of Georgia’s Hybrid Ecosystem**
Georgia has grown into one of the nation’s [most diverse homeschooling environments](https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/once-a-crime-now-a-cornerstone-inside-georgias-homeschooling-boom/), according to Atlanta Magazine. The surge isn't just about home education; it’s a boom in forest schools, microschools, and hybrid models that blend the flexibility of home with the community of a classroom. It almost sounds like something we've been touting as "open education."

**Merlyn Mind Wins Big at CES**
Merlyn Origin, a voice-enabled AI teaching assistant, walked away with a [top innovation award](https://www.beaconjournal.com/press-release/story/137370/merlyn-for-education-wins-top-innovation-award-at-ces/) at the Consumer Electronics Show. The tool helps teachers control classroom tech and generate lesson plans through voice, allowing them to focus on students instead of fiddling with chargers and tabs.

**The Homeschooling Outcomes Debate Re-enters the Frame**
A memoir review in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2026/01/homeschooled-book-regulations/685589/) by Stefan Merrill Block highlights the extreme variance in homeschooling outcomes. As the movement grows to over 3% of the U.S. student population, the conversation is shifting from "should families do it?" to "how do we ensure quality without bureaucratic overload?" <We need some notes here:
- We should probably point out the response from the guy on X.
- That's just a classical learner who pointed out in one of the earlier newsletters the importance of checking the source material.
- He kind of like that we should not generalize and we should always keep the big picture in mind that homeschoolers are actually outperforming kids in almost every area.
- If we want to talk about who's falling behind, let's look at the number of school districts in Chicago that don't have a single person reading at grade level or something like that.>

## Ed's Stable

We talk a lot about how it takes a village to raise a kid, but we often forget to ask where the village actually is. As Krisy Shaughnessy noted in our podcast this week, "If you want to be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager." That means being the one to pick a park, send the email, and invite others to the messiness of community.

We saw that energy in the Creative Studio this week as families shared their Zentangle art and chemistry experiment results. It’s a reminder that even in an age of AI coaches and global data trends, the core of education is still human connection.

What’s one book your family is obsessing over right now? Reply to this email and let me know—I’ll be sharing the top picks in next week’s special "Once Upon a Time" wrap-up. <Link to the Padlet URL again: >

Meme of the week:

<Here we're going to link to a funny image showing Darth Maul with two lightsaber blades:
- The first one is he first pulls out the first blade and it says "Teenagers writing essays with AI".
- The second blade of the lightsaber and it says something like "Teachers grading essays with AI".
We need a caption something along the lines of "The only way to win is not to enter the fight" or something like that. Give me a few variations>


That's all for this week!
