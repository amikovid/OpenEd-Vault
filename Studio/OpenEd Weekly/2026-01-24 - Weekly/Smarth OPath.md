How do I help my homeschooled teen figure out what comes after high school?

It’s a question many homeschool parents start asking early on, especially without a guidance counselor or a clearly defined path to follow.

In this episode, Robert sits down with college counselor, educator, and homeschool parent Alison Hamar to talk through how families can approach college and career planning with more clarity and a lot less pressure.

They discuss how to help kids explore interests before committing to a specific path, what colleges actually look for in homeschool students, and how to think about transcripts and testing in a way that feels manageable, not overwhelming. Alison also shares why real-world exposure matters so much, and how parents can keep options open as their kids grow, change, and rethink what they want.

If you’re unsure when to start, what truly matters, or how to prepare without pushing too hard, this conversation will help you feel more grounded and confident about what comes next.

Hi, I'm Robert Gamble. Welcome Allison to the podcast. Uh Allison is a college
0:14
counselor, educator, and homeschooled parent. Uh today we're going to be learning a bit more about how she helps
0:19
families with um figuring out what their kids want to do after college. Um thinking about the path to college, uh
0:26
as well. Um really excited to hear from Allison. um and learn more about her background.
0:32
Thanks so much, Robert. Um I'm so excited to be here. I've actually been a fan of Smart Path from like the very
0:38
beginning. Um so, I'm just super grateful to get to meet with you and
0:43
yeah, talk about what um college counseling looks like in in the homeschool space. I um I started my
0:51
career as a teacher in private education and just kind of out of this like
0:56
natural organic situation like students coming in and asking for help with personal statements and applications. I
1:03
all of a sudden had this audience of you know lunchtime friends that were going
1:09
through this process together. And so I did two years of that and then eventually the high school that I worked
1:15
at was like hey Ally will you come and you know fill this space for us and so I
1:20
ended up doing that. I am a mom of two and so eventually I was like man I
1:26
really started having to face some of those questions of like what do we want education to look like in our own home
1:32
and we decided to homeschool. And so at the same time that we were we were homeschooling, I was also pivoting into
1:39
this um you know space of working for myself and and just doing more college
1:44
counseling and um partnering with edtech companies to provide counseling services
1:50
kind of across the nation. It was at that time um when everything kind of like the boom of remote work was was
1:58
happening. And so, yeah, so I I basically just transitioned in that space at the same time as homeschooling
2:04
and and have balanced both ever since. Cool. Yeah, it seems like especially in
2:09
this new kind of remote work world, parents are finding that they have the option to do homeschooling when maybe it
2:14
wasn't an option before where both parents are going into an office every day. Um, yeah, it's definitely an
2:20
interesting uh way that technology is enabling people to, you know, try this additional form of education for their
2:25
kids. Yeah, I'm really grateful for the opportunity and it and it's been it's
2:30
just been a really big blessing for our family being able to guide our children. Our son went to a little bit of um I
2:37
would say like inerson education, but our daughter's been homeschooled the whole time and so we've really enjoyed it as a family. It's been a really good
2:43
fit for us and and honestly it's given me a really unique insight in my career. Right. Most of the time I think um
2:50
college counselors really work with a lot of students that are in more of a you know compulsory education type of
2:56
situation where they're going to school every day or they're in private school. But we know um and your audience knows
3:01
that there's just so many options about how we want that to look and and so much flexibility. And so it's been great for
3:08
me personally um as a counselor to say, "Hey, okay, we're aware of all of these options that we have. How do we
3:13
integrate them to build a really strong either college application or even um
3:19
just a really strong resume to say, "Hey, this is what my student wants to do so that we can launch them into life successfully."
3:26
Yeah. Can you can you talk me through a little bit kind of how you think about uh or how you talk to families about
3:33
what path their kid wants to go down? You know, do they want to maybe go the trades route? Do they want to go to college? Um how does that conversation
3:40
kind of start? Right. I think that's that's definitely what a lot of parents are thinking about is, you know, they just they want to give their kid the
3:46
right advice basically and they want to make sure their kid is happy with what they uh with what they end up doing. Um
3:52
and so, you know, how do you kind of start that conversation? What are kind of the key things to think about as
3:58
parents talk about that with their kids or talk with you specifically? Um yeah, how how do you kind of start that
4:03
conversation and and how do you evaluate? Well, I think that as parents, we know that we are um we know our children
4:11
really well, right? Like I would even argue that we know our children better than they know themselves at certain
4:16
times in their life. And so being really honest with ourselves as parents and going, "Okay, what are my child's
4:22
strengths and weaknesses?" And having that conversation, not just, you know, as a parent, but also with your child.
4:28
Hey, what do you what do you think you're good at? What are you naturally good at? What are what are your passions? What do you love doing? what
4:34
could you just waste the day away doing? Um, and really try to lean into um their
4:40
passions, their gifts, their talents, their interests, and then go from there. Okay. Not everyone did I know at 13 that
4:47
I was going to be a college counselor? No, I didn't. But I did know at 13 that I loved people and that I wanted to help
4:53
people and that I wanted to be in a space where I was not working by myself,
4:59
where I was in a collaborative environment. Um, I played competitive sports as a kid and so I think that I
5:05
really thrived in that. So there are things that we know about our children kind of naturally, right? Like
5:11
personality types, interests and passions. I'm a fan I'm going to say this with a
5:18
without with some hesitation, but I am a fan of some personality inventories. And I think that like 16 personality
5:23
inventories is a great way to just hey sit down with your your student. If you if your child is a junior or senior, I
5:29
would say let them loose. Take that by themselves. See what comes back. Um if you have a freshman or sophomore, even
5:36
an eighth grader, I would say go ahead and sit down with them and and make sure
5:41
that they're just not like totally, you know, unself-aware. Like they're answering these questions,
5:46
but really you're like, "Huh, that doesn't seem true to you." Um and so guiding them through some of that. I'm
5:53
also a big believer in exposure. Like the more that we expose them to what
5:59
people do and what future careers can look like, the more empowered that they're going to feel to make a
6:04
decision. And so what I talk about with my clients a lot and um kind of the culture of my practice is like let's
6:11
have just like a lot of curiosity everywhere that you go in all of your interactions in life. Asking people,
6:19
hey, what do you do for work? Or do you like your career? what does this look like? You know, you're at the doctor's office and instead of just like, oh
6:26
gosh, okay, I'm going through the motions, like really looking around, paying attention to, you know, what does
6:31
your doctor do all day? Really, right? I know I know what Grey's Anatomy says your doctor does all day, but like what
6:37
does your doctor actually do all day? Um, and so really trying to encourage um
6:43
young people to be curious about their surroundings and and where they feel like they fit in that.
6:49
Absolutely. And it and it seems like within homeschooling there's pro there's more flexibility to kind of pursue that,
6:55
right? I think it's kind of built in the way that homeschooling is very self-led in many cases. Um and also there's still
7:02
a lot more flexibility, right? You know, it's not one curriculum that you're working off of. Whereas in a public or
7:07
private school, they have a set curriculum. So for homeschool families, it seems a little bit more straightforward to do that exploratory
7:14
curiositydriven path that you're talking about. um what are some tips that you give to to maybe public uh kids in
7:20
public or private school? So, how do you what are some specific tips for them to kind of find that flexibility or find
7:26
those opportunities? Um you are there is it shadowing? Uh I know internships are
7:31
very popular um especially these days. Um so yeah, I'd love to hear more your
7:36
thoughts on that. Yeah, I think that both spaces have um have their pros and cons. So for
7:43
homeschoolers, definitely there's more space for this kind of um exploration.
7:48
And then for kids that are in public and private schools, they have um access to more clubs, right? So they're going to
7:55
be able to join clubs at school. Hey, I'm interested in healthcare. Great. Join HOSA. Um one of the things that I
8:02
encourage students to do is kind of to fill three separate buckets. There's leadership, there's service, and there's
8:09
demonstrated interest. And so leadership kind of self-explanatory. What are you doing in your community? Um service
8:15
again same thing how you're serving others. Demonstrated interest is basically what are your interests and
8:22
how are you showcasing you know that you've demonstrated some like you're pursuing those things in some way that's
8:28
you know actually meaningful. So a lot of students will do like a pre-ol
8:34
program. They'll go to a university and experience it firsthand. I know sometimes it's a little bit challenging
8:40
because some of these things are very expensive and parents are going, "Hey, how do I how do I leverage these things?
8:46
How do I figure out what do I spend my money doing?" And um does your does your child need to do a pre-ol program to get
8:52
into college? No. Are there advantages to doing it? Yeah, they're on a college campus. They're seeing what they like
8:58
and they don't like. Um they're getting some exposure to the coursework of something that they think that they're interested in, like, "Oh, I want to be a
9:04
vet. I love my horse." Okay, great. Let's let's, you know, get you on a college campus and in a course. Oh, I
9:10
actually hated that biology class. Okay, great. Let's go back to the drawing board, right? Like having some of those
9:15
conversations of like exposure, re-evaluate, exposure, reevaluate. And we can't expect our kids to be on this
9:22
linear course because to be honest, 90% of us have not been on a linear course,
9:28
right? So, I think that we have to expect deviations and kind of allow them to go,
9:33
hey, I thought I wanted this and I don't. Okay, that that's okay. Like, let's let's just make sure that we're
9:39
continuing to do the things that we're passionate about. And something that's interesting to me that I think a lot of
9:45
um parents and even students don't think about is that what they're like, okay, my son plays piano and he'll definitely
9:53
be putting that on his college applications, right? Because he's spending a bunch of time doing it. He also does downhill mountain biking. I'm
10:00
not sure we're going to leverage that, but like he does spend a lot of time doing it. And so he could potentially put that on there as well. So as your
10:08
child is picking and choosing their interests, don't feel like
10:13
it's uh oh my gosh, I don't want them to do that because they won't be able to put that on a college application or I
10:18
don't want them to do that because how are they going to use that in a future career? Um you might be surprised at
10:23
some of the lessons that they're learning and the things that they're um they're gaining from all of these
10:29
experiences that we're exposing them to. Yeah, definitely. I think, you know, when I was going through my own college
10:35
applications way back when, um, very similar experience, right? It's what do you put on there? How do you make sure
10:41
that you're highlighting kind of the right, I don't know, experiences and background? Um, and so it sounds like
10:47
there's there's probably a lot of opportunities to highlight things that wouldn't typically come up, right?
10:53
There's there's all the, you know, if it's sports, I think typically it's like sports instruments, then clubs are what
10:59
people kind of lean into. Um, but at the same time, I mean, I we're I'm based in Santa Cruz here, and so if somebody's
11:06
surfing every day, right, well, they're learning to probably do conflict resolution, right? It's pretty packed
11:12
out at Pleasure Point all the time. Um, and so, you know, they're probably, you know, learning how to how to interact
11:17
politely with others. They're learning um, you know, how to how to navigate maybe a situation where somebody cuts in
11:24
front of them on the wave. So, they're, you know, developing some good, you know, um, self-control, I guess. Um, so
11:30
emotional regulation. Um, so there's definitely a lot of uh a lot of like small and good lessons that can be
11:36
highlighted in the applications. Yeah. And even if you even if surfing doesn't end up making the like
11:42
activities list, right, that you have other things you want to put on there with your 10 slots, you may end up writing about that in an essay, right?
11:48
Like you said, kind of like, okay, I'm not going to leverage it here, but when it, you know, how did you overcome a challenge? Great. Let's talk about that.
11:55
Downhill mountain biking, man, you're really, you're hurting yourself. there's lots of challenges. So, I think that we
12:02
have to be careful not to kind of force our kids into these like pre-prescribed
12:08
boxes, right? We really want to allow them to pursue the things they're passionate about. But on that note, we
12:15
don't want it to just be like we we don't want them to settle into
12:20
just this kind of like h yeah, I've I do this thing and I kind of do it every once in a while.
12:26
If your child has these big goals of going to a competitive university, you really need to encourage them or help
12:33
them to push those activities to the next level, right? And not every kid is going to fall on that spectrum, right?
12:39
There's a pretty small percentage of kids that are like, "Hey, Ally, I want to go to a T20 school." Okay, well, we
12:44
should probably start working together like, you know, in eighth grade essentially. Let's let's build this
12:49
profile together over the course of five years. if you're like, you know, we want our kids to get into a great state
12:56
school or a UC. Well, I don't know. The UC's are kind of a beast on their own. Um, but like we want them, we want to be
13:04
able to meet them where they're at. And I'm for the first time as a mom with an eighth grader, um, kind of stepping into
13:12
these roles simultaneously, right? I've I've helped hundreds of students build profiles and, you know, launch into
13:19
college and even careers. And now I'm looking at my own kid and I'm going, "Oh, wow. Okay, this is such a different
13:24
view of the room." Um, and I just I'm appreciating it so far and I'm excited
13:30
about it because I think it's going to give me an additional layer for my clients and for parents because that's
13:37
one of the things, right? Like we have expectations for our family and for our children. And I think that that is okay
13:42
and healthy. And so if you don't want your child to go to college um 2,000
13:48
miles away and you're the one that's paying for it, I think it's really healthy to to say, "Hey, this is these
13:56
are our boundaries. This is our expectation." Um because then it just sets it sets the
14:02
tone for the entire experience, right? Um but we are as parents, we're kind of juggling this like, okay, how much
14:08
autonomy do I give to you? How much independence do I give to you? you're not really ready for all of these decisions. Do you know what it looks
14:15
like to go into $400,000 worth of debt? Like, you know, we're we're kind of like trying to give them as much um
14:22
responsibility and choice as we can while also not really, you know, giving them too much rope that we know what
14:28
they'll, you know, eventually do with it. Yeah. No, it's definitely kind of mirroring how, you know, adults make
14:35
their own decisions and conversations, right? you know, I don't think that, for example, I don't think I would have
14:40
a conversation with my wife about moving 2,000 miles away all at once, right? And
14:46
so, you know, that's that's a gradual conversation. We probably would only bring it up if there's some alignment
14:51
beforehand to make sure that we're both open to that idea, right? And so it makes sense to start having those
14:56
conversations early so that that way um you know you're um when a student gets
15:02
to the point that they're applying to colleges, they have one view viewpoint coming in and then their parents are like oh no no no no we're not doing that
15:09
or oh no no you are doing this you know you have to go for that top 20 school when maybe the student doesn't want to.
15:14
Right. Yeah. So definitely, you know, I think that's some great advice starting those conversations early so that way you're
15:20
on the same page and it's more of like a gradual journey together and then again, you know, getting to the point where I
15:26
if if your child want is motivated to go to a top 20 school, well, there's a lot of work to get there, right?
15:32
And it's it's a little too late if you're if you're, you know, two months out from college applications and then they say, "Oh, well, I haven't we
15:38
haven't done any of the ground work for that." Right? So, I think starting early is is is a really great piece of advice. Um,
15:44
and that doesn't mean like a monthly meeting in eighth grade, right? Like I think that sometimes it can feel intimidating as parents to go, oh my
15:50
gosh, okay, what does starting early even look like? And so it's like, okay, let's have an initial meeting. Um,
15:57
maybe, you know, it's second semester of 8th grade and you say like, what high school are you going to? What's your GPA
16:03
been so far? Right? And we're just kind of we're building this um what I call like a master plan. And on there, it's
16:09
going to track courses. Hey, I think eventually I want to go to business into business school. Great. You're going to
16:14
have to have calculus. How many, you know, how many math courses do you have to take to get there? Right? Like all of this information that I just think like
16:22
as a parent outside of this space. Like I would have no idea. Nobody's sitting us down and going, "Okay, these are like
16:28
the prerequisites. You have to have a fine arts credit. You have to have two consecutive years of the same language."
16:35
So, it's I mean there's definitely a lot of moving parts and pieces and I I think
16:41
that it is really really it's a travesty when students get to the end of their high school and they realize, oh, my
16:47
high school has prepared me to graduate high school and has not prepared me to metriculate into college. And so, we h
16:54
we have to be proactive, right? And and what would you say? So for homeschool parents, what would you say are kind of
17:00
the most overlooked kind of prep work that they should be talking to their kids about to, you know, make sure that
17:06
they're ready? I mean, there's there's more flexibility, right? But then with more flexibility, there's more room for
17:11
not being prepared when you want to get there as well. Um, so I think you definitely have to be a bit more intentional about it.
17:17
Yeah. Um because, you know, there's not a school guidance counselor that's saying, "Hey, by the way, college apps are in x
17:22
amount of years. You you probably should think about these things." um which is built into the public school system. So
17:28
what what kind of yeah what are the things that you you see get kind of overlooked by homeschool families?
17:34
That's a yeah that's a great question. Okay, so I think there's several. I think that testing is generally
17:40
overlooked. Um and I I'm I will be the first to say I am not like a super
17:45
proponent of standardized tests. I think it's a poor measure. I could definitely get on a soap box about that, but I
17:50
won't. I'll spare you. um it is something that is a part of our system. And so if we if they have these goals,
17:57
if they want to get scholarships, if they want to go to a competitive school or program, then we have to be able to
18:03
help them um you know, kind of prepare for standardized tests, they don't they're not just going to take a PSAT
18:09
sophomore, junior year like they would at a high school, right? So really, I think that's one of the bigger ones is
18:15
okay, do we want to leverage tests? A lot of schools are test optional and test blind for admissions, but they
18:21
still will connect um some of their scholarships to those. And so we want, you know, as homeschool parents, we want
18:27
to go, okay, um do we want our child to test? What do we want that to look like? And I think a
18:33
lot of it just depends on goals. So if you're like, I know my child's going to go into community college. That's where we're comfortable. They're going to
18:39
that's where they're going to start. Great. your journey is going to look really different compared to someone who's like, "Hey, we want our kids to
18:45
get into a competitive UC um or another competitive university. How do we get there?" Right? So, I think kind of
18:52
trying to figure out as a family for homeschool families like okay, what are our expectations? What are our child's
18:58
goals? Um what is the financial feasibility of these goals? Right? It's like that's the big elephant in the room
19:04
in college counseling is like what do we want to spend on higher education? what what are we going to require of our
19:11
child to spend or what is their skin going to be in the game? Um and really just coming up with with um some of
19:18
these goals. I think as I think as homeschool parents um we often are actually really adept to doing that
19:24
because we've done that with their education already. We're like we're the ones that are setting the goals, right? So it's the same thing. It's just a
19:31
whole it's another layer of it, right? Okay. So, we've done this with, you know, elementary, middle school, or
19:37
maybe just high school. And now, what do we want that to look like? I also um I
19:43
have a funny story. So, I had a student come to me. He's a senior in high school. And I asked him if I could share
19:50
share this. I was like, I'm going to throw you under the bus a little bit. And he's like, yeah, great. So, I was working in private education. He came to
19:56
me. I was his English teacher, and he's like, miss, this is in Hawaii. I'm never gonna use your class once I graduate
20:03
ever. Like, cool. Thank you for that. Okay, so let's talk about what what are
20:09
we trying to get what are we trying to get out here? He's like, I want to be I want to be a captain. I want to work on boats. I want to be a captain. Um I want
20:15
to get my captain's license this year, but I don't have time to get it because I'm too busy writing papers for your class.
20:21
Okay, great. So, what are we going to do about that? He's like, "Well, I'm proposing that I work on my master my my
20:28
captain's license in your class." I said, "Okay, well, what do I get out of this, you know?" And he's like, "Yeah, I
20:34
don't know." I'm like, "Okay, well, if you don't pass your captain's license, you don't pass my class." That's it,
20:41
right? Yeah, that sounds a great idea. So, then he did. He sat at my desk
20:47
during English and he brought his massive stack of books and he studied and he passed. And guess what he's
20:53
doing? He's he is a licensed captain in Hawaii and he's you know he's running big barges and he's doing fabulous. I
20:59
had um lunch with him and his beautiful family when we were there last and and so I think that we have to listen to our
21:06
kids right like they some of them know what they want to do and we have to create space for them to accomplish
21:12
those goals. Yeah. Absolutely. And especially, you know, if they if they have such a set
21:18
goal already, right? Or or yeah, if it's a kid who says, you know, I really want to do this one thing and it's very
21:24
specific. Um yeah, that's that's awesome, right? Um I had a so I had an
21:29
question from something you said. So there's definitely a lot of um standardized testing, right, that comes
21:34
kind of towards the end of of high school. So that's going to be the SAT, Act, right? um is so but there's also a
21:43
lot of um standardized testing that comes earlier um for public and and
21:48
private school students. So is that something that that homeschool families should be looking at too? I mean what options are out there just as a way to
21:55
benchmark? And then kind of a a follow- on question to that is um so with
22:01
transcript preparation um you know we've we've interviewed a ton of families here at Smart Path and one of one of the
22:08
points that gets brought up is sometimes if you're in a very low um reporting state. So for example, if you're in a
22:14
state where you just don't really need to send a transcript um to comply with state regulations. And so then they they
22:21
kind of get to the end of high school and then they need to look back and say, "Oh, wow. We actually need to go back and compile all this." So would you
22:27
recommend compiling that starting in like earlier eighth grade if you're in a if you're in a low regulatory state? You
22:32
know, what what's kind of like the way to to go about that? Yeah, those are those are both great questions. That's actually one of the
22:38
things that I do with my homeschool clients is like we build a transcript essentially, right? And we we um record
22:44
all the courses that you've taken and the grades that they've been in. And then what I do with the parents is I say, "Okay, you have to fill out this
22:51
education plan." So I have record of all the courses and the grades and then you have to tell me what that what your student did, right? Basically just like
22:57
a syllabus for each of these classes. Um and if you're using a curriculum, it's
23:03
pretty simple, right? They usually have those resources for you. If you are pulling a bunch of resources, then that
23:08
can be a pretty big lift. It can. So I definitely think um starting in eighth grade. Okay, so I'm going to back up a
23:15
little bit. There are high school qualifying courses that your child can take in middle school, both for public,
23:22
private, and homeschool families. Um, foreign language is one of those, and mathematics is one of those. Algebra 1
23:28
counts as a high school class for middle school students. So, if you're homeschooling and your child's doing algebra 1 and middle school, guess what?
23:34
They're getting high school credit for that or they can. And so we want to make sure that so if your child's a seventh
23:40
grader taking algebra 1, then that's really when that transcript and that education kind of plan needs to start.
23:46
Um so that I would say would be the beginning. In our house, my husband and I sat down and we said, "Okay, what do
23:52
we think about standardized tests? How do we how do we feel about all of this?" Um
23:59
I think where we landed I think a lot of things but where we landed was um we are going to have our
24:06
child take a standardized test twice a year um just because there is there are
24:11
very few opportunities for him and I as homeschoolers to facilitate tests for
24:17
them and we both know that if they decide to go to college that they decide that that's something they want to do
24:23
that they were they are going to have to have that skill. um to be able to sit and take a test and and get through it
24:30
and not feel overwhelmed. There's, you know, there's all of the like um the
24:35
emotional and psychological aspects of testing, right? That we're all aware of. Yes. No, it's a it's a it's like a
24:41
climbing a mountain, right? And um you know, building if you know that you need to take an SAT or an ACT at some point,
24:47
right? That those are long tests. Um yeah, definitely building those muscles a little early is super helpful
24:53
because otherwise if you walk into that blind Yeah. It's it's a that it's not going to be a very e, you know, fun
24:58
experience. And as homeschoolers, like my both of my kids starting freshman year will take a
25:05
like SAT or ACT prep course as part of their curriculum because we have the flexibility to do that. And they don't
25:12
teach that in school. They don't teach you how to read the questions or how to, you know, take your time, how to
25:17
leverage your time to answer those questions. And so a lot of it is, you know, I have these wildly brilliant
25:24
students um that are expecting to do so well on the test and the test comes back and they're like, "What happened?" And
25:30
I'm like, "Well, you've never taken this test. How do you expect to be good at something?" That's like me handing you,
25:36
you know, a flute and going, "Play for everyone. It's going to be fabulous." And then, you know, you you fail because
25:42
you've never been trained to do it, right? Yeah. Absolutely. It's like, "No, actually, it's like I played soccer. I
25:48
you I'm talented at that but I don't know how to play the flute, right? Um yeah, absolutely. So yeah, so it seems
25:55
like um you know the advice is just kind of start to prepare early, have the conversation early and then really think
26:01
about okay well if there is this end point that's in goal or that's in mind I should say. um what you know how do we
26:08
kind of get there and and then for homeschool family the nice thing is as you pointed out you can do that SAT prep
26:14
early um and you know get them prepared even before maybe public school kids
26:20
would be um yeah yeah one of the things that I do want to mention um is that students need
26:28
a lot of choices so I will tell you that every single cycle that I have at the
26:33
end of the cycle I have seniors oh I had a senior Last year she swore, I will not go to UC Davis. I will never go there.
26:40
That is not where I'm going. I do not want to go there. Guess where she is going this year? She is going to UC
26:46
Davis and she's excited and she can't wait. Right? So, we have to remember as adults that just because our child says
26:53
something even three months ago does not mean that it is true for them today. And
26:58
so, I just encourage families um you know, wherever your kids are in school, right? whether they're homeschooled or
27:04
they're in private or public school, just make sure that you're helping them
27:09
to build a profile that will take them in any direction. Right? So, at the end
27:14
of their time in high school, they have choices to go directly into the career into a career, they can go to the
27:20
military, they can, you know, they can go to community college or they can go directly into university because I mean,
27:27
we we all know that, right, from living life that things can change in an instant. And so even if your child is
27:33
saying, "I'm never going to go to college, mom. I'm never going to do it. It's not going to happen for me." Great.
27:38
I'm so Jimmy, thank you for being so honest with me. You are still applying to this community college and these three universities, and it's going to be
27:45
fine. This is just going to be a part of your education experience. And at the end of the school year, if he says, you
27:51
know, no, I still don't want to do it, great. He still has the option to pursue that if he so chooses. Right? So really,
27:59
our job and my job as a counselor is not to decide where my clients are going to go or have strong opinions about what
28:05
the outcomes are. It's really just to help them have as many options as possible. Yeah. It's like how do you prepare to
28:11
make sure that the doors open should you decide to go that direction the future, right? Yeah.
28:17
Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, yeah, it's it's a really it's a really exciting and
28:22
fun way to partner with families and students and I just every year I feel more and more gratitude to be in this
28:28
space and um yeah, it's just it's incredible what young people are doing. I know that society um throws a lot of
28:36
shade at this generation, but they're also they're they're incredible. They really are. They're so resilient.
28:42
They're doing they're doing really cool things. I have clients all over the world and I'm just I'm I'm amazed. I
28:50
can't wait to see um how they change the world because they're already doing it in, you know, in high school.
28:55
Yeah. I know in the startup scene, you know, one one thing that I've se noticed is that there's much younger founders
29:01
these days, right? Um it's almost um it's it used to be, okay, you you have
29:08
half your startups are a bunch of um Stanford dropouts, right? um and they're, you know, 19, 20, 21
29:15
maybe. Um, and that's, you know, the typical group of founders in in Silicon Valley. Um, but now it's it's even high
29:21
school students, right? And and I think what's really interesting is that they're seeing challenges that they want
29:27
to solve and then also then having the agency to go do that. That's that's really cool. Well, I think you're actually I think
29:33
you're going to talk to one of my clients shortly. uh your audience is going to hear from her and I I won't I
29:39
won't and no spoiler alerts but yeah I mean they're they're just fantastic. They're they're incredible young people
29:45
and I think that that's really the goal is like let's continue putting opportunities in front of them until something sticks and they love it and
29:52
they gravitate towards it and they run with it, right? And it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be an edtech
29:57
startup. It can be, you know, it can be a photography business. It can be going overseas. It can be a million different
30:03
things. But we have to make sure that they know that they have options, right? That's like the first step. And I I will
30:10
also encourage families that um just because your child gets into a university doesn't mean it's the best
30:17
fit for them. And so we have to be really honest about that too, right? Because ideally they're going to have
30:23
choices. They're going to apply to, you know, between 12 and 15 schools. Hopefully they get into half of those.
30:28
Um and then they sit down and they go, "Okay, do I just go to the most selective university that I got into?" because it's quote unquote the best one.
30:35
Um, that is definitely not my strategy as a practitioner. Like I I want them to
30:40
get into university and to thrive and to find their people and um and to really
30:46
be successful there. Yeah, absolutely. And I think there's so many helpful questions that parents can
30:52
also ask their kids too throughout all of this. Um, you know, the example I'll give is that you I went to to Calpy
30:58
Pomona down in Southern California. Um, I assumed that that all of Southern California was right next to the beach.
31:04
Um, and so I thought I'd be, you know, 10 minutes from the beach. Um, and um, I
31:10
didn't realize that it was more like an hour and a half. Um, and so, you know, in my mind it was like, "Oh, yeah,
31:15
Southern California School, you're next to the beach. That's awesome. It's going to be a great time." I still had a great time. I loved the school I went to. But
31:20
um at the same time, you know, my parents could have just pulled out Google Google Maps and like you do realize that, you know, if your
31:26
selection criteria is being near the beach, you're not really near the beach at that school. Are you sure you want that? Right? And I think that's Yeah,
31:31
that's where just having a good conversation with your kid can really help them understand because there's things that we as adults just think are
31:39
obvious, right? And maybe to a kid, you know, to to a student, it's not as obvious. And so just having that
31:44
conversation and getting on the same page is a great way to help them figure out what they want to do. Yeah, absolutely. The other thing is you
31:51
have no idea how much advice your student is taking from t Tik Tok, right? Like it is it is such a it's an incredible
32:00
tool, but it's also it is so frustrating sometimes because there's this world out
32:05
there that exists that's telling young people that they're not good enough, that whatever they're doing is not enough. And you know, there's these kids
32:13
and they're not meaning to, but they're basically saying like, I did all of these things and that's how I got into
32:18
this school. And then this student over here is going like, well, I'm not doing those things and so I'm never going to
32:24
measure up to this standard, right? And so we have to be really careful about
32:29
what is, you know, what's the input, right? because they what you might think is like gh my teenager is being so lazy
32:36
which they might be being lazy or they might just be really overwhelmed by all the things that they should quote
32:41
unquote be doing that they don't feel is possible for them. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. It's um it's maybe
32:49
a little bit of choice paralysis too in that sense because there are I mean there's so many different options, right? There's so many schools
32:54
everywhere. there's so many different careers to go into and um you know I know that when I was in high school I
33:00
didn't really know what I wanted to do um and and especially now I can totally
33:05
resonate with your your point about TikTok there's so much pressure geared towards um you know basically young
33:11
adults and young kids thinking about okay well how you know how do I become a millionaire at at 18 right you know
33:18
that's that's a lot of the content on there the reality is is that a lot of it's fake
33:23
and and also more important importantly is that trying to compare yourself or or think about there's like one game plan
33:28
that you have to follow because you saw it on on social media, it's not going to be very fulfilling. Um it most likely
33:34
won't be very fulfilling. Um cool. So before we wrap up, um yeah, Allison,
33:40
thank you for being on. Um Allison is going to be joining us as the first um first counselor and and adviser on our
33:47
Smart Path uh tutor advisor marketplace. So we're really excited to have you working with us there. Um, any closing
33:54
like last bit of advice uh before we we close out uh for families? Gosh, I I just like I encourage you to
34:01
to step into the space with your kids, right? Just to have the conversation. Start somewhere and don't feel like you
34:07
are doing it alone or that you're the only one feeling overwhelmed. Um because it's just everyone's there, right?
34:15
Everybody's feeling this pressure. I'm starting to feel this pressure with a, you know, as a mom with an eighth
34:20
grader, like, okay, we've gotten them this far and I don't I don't want to I
34:25
don't want to watch them fall on their face, right? So, I would just encourage you to reach out if you need help. Um,
34:31
it doesn't have to be a $25,000 package. I know a lot of people can feel really overwhelmed by the cost of college
34:37
counseling because of what it looks like online. Um, but there's really affordable, totally feasible solutions
34:44
for everyone. Um, and so I would say like really don't hesitate to reach out and and ask for help. And um, yeah, I'm
34:51
just I'm excited to be here in the space. I'm super grateful to SmartP um, for just building this kind of ecosystem
34:58
for all of us to come together and um, yeah. Yeah, thanks for having me. Yeah, thank you. It was it was an
35:03
awesome discussion. Really appreciate you being here and being a partner for Smart Path. Um, I encourage anyone who
35:09
uh is looking for advice for their kids getting ready for for what's what comes after K through 12, get in touch with
35:16
Allison. Um, we've had many conversations over the past year and a half with Smart Path Journey. Um, and
35:22
she's just been wonderful to talk to every single time. So, thank you Allison. This is Smart Path Conversations. Thanks to everybody for
35:28
listening.
