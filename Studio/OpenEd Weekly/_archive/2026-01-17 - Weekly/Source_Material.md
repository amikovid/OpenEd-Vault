## 1. DEEP DIVE: Charlotte Mason Method
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/charlotte-mason
**Published:** 2026-01-14
**Type:** Blog Post (Deep Dive)
**Summary:** Learn the Charlotte Mason method for homeschooling - living books, short lessons, nature study. Practical tips from real families plus curriculum reviews.

### Opening (for newsletter intro section):

In the late 1800s, as England built its first compulsory education system, Victorian educator Charlotte Mason gave parents a pressure valve: permission to trust themselves.

This was as radical in her time as it is in ours - perhaps more so. The message of compulsory schooling was clear: leave teaching to the professionals. Mason disagreed. Children are born persons, she said - not blank slates waiting for experts to inscribe knowledge. They're capable of engaging with real ideas from the start. And parents who know their children are capable of guiding that journey.

Mason wrote six volumes on education, founded the Parents' National Educational Union, and trained teachers at her college in Ambleside, England. But she never created a curriculum.

A Google search for "Charlotte Mason curriculum" returns millions of results - detailed book lists, year-by-year schedules, scope and sequences. Some guides get specific: "you *must* read Plutarch's *Lives*," they tell you, or, "you *have to* include this particular sequence of history." These guides can be helpful starting points. But we have to remember that they're interpretations of Mason's philosophy, not the philosophy itself.

Plutarch himself - a Greek historian and philosopher - would probably object to being made into "mandatory reading." To Plutarch the quote is often attributed that, "the mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled." The original is even better: "The correct analogy for the mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting - no more - and then it motivates one towards originality and instills the desire for truth."

That's the spirit Charlotte Mason was after. Not a checklist to complete, but a fire to tend.

## 2. DAY IN THE LIFE: Charlynn Chambers (Oregon)
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/charlynn-chambers-day-in-the-life
**Published:** 2026-01-15
**Type:** Blog Post (Podcast substitute)
**Summary:** Stop trying to be a classroom teacher. Oregon OpenEd mom Charlynn Chambers shares her flexible method for homeschooling - weekly quotas, Dad Skills, and the 9:30 AM rule that saved her sanity.

### Full Content:

**8:00 AM: The Morning Launch (and the 9:30 Rule)**

"I have four kids, ranging from preschool to middle school. If we don't start with structure, we don't start at all."

The first thing my kids do is check their Morning Lists on our Skylight calendar. Before academics, we hit all of the basic human "hygiene" responsibilities:
- Brush teeth
- Brush hair
- Make beds
- Morning chores (my 4-year-old handles silverware; the 11-year-old does the heavier lifting)

**The Rule:** We have a "Hard Stop" at 9:30 AM. Everything on that morning list needs to be done by then. If they finish at 9:00 AM? Awesome - they get 30 minutes to play before breakfast. If they drag their feet and finish at 9:29 AM? They made it, but they lost their free time.

This single rule saves my sanity. It teaches them that work comes before play - not because I said so, but because that's how time works.

**10:00 AM: The "Menu" and The Juggle**

Once breakfast is done, we open the Home Learning Profile on the Skylight.

"I don't have a rigid schedule that says '10:00 AM is Math' and '11:00 AM is History.' Instead, I have a weekly quota. I want to hit History twice a week. I want to hit Science twice a week."

**1:00 PM: "Dad Skills" and Dirty Hands**

One of the specific items on our weekly menu is "Dad Skills." My husband is handy - woodworking, resin, fixing cars. We want our kids to learn that solving problems with your hands is just as important as solving them with a pencil.

Today, we're building a shop. The kids were out there helping frame the rafters. My husband was showing them how to nail the wood together, and suddenly, they were in the middle of a geometry lesson - calculating angles and counting similar sides.

He didn't even realize he was teaching math. I walked out and said, "You guys are doing Dad Skills right now."

**The Takeaway:**
"We fit the school to the life, not the life to the school."

## 3. ED'S STABLE: A Parrot, a Man, and the Point of Algebra
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/a-parrot-a-man-and-the-point-of-algebra
**Published:** 2026-01-13
**Type:** Daily Newsletter (puzzle/fun content)
**Summary:** I used ChatGPT to solve an 8th grade algebra problem. Are our mental muscles atrophying - or did school just teach us wrong?

### The Puzzle:
A pirate stands with a parrot on his head. When the parrot stands on the pirate's head, their combined height is 200 centimeters. When they stand next to each other, the difference between their heights is 170 centimeters.

**How tall is the parrot?**

### The Solution:
- M + P = 200
- M - P = 170
- Add them: 2M = 370, so M = 185
- Therefore P = 15 cm

### Key Quote:
"Most people who 'learned' this in school don't remember it because they memorized steps for a test instead of building intuition."

Isaac Morehouse: "Algebra is about figuring out puzzles when you don't have all the pieces. I loved solving for X, as long as it was the X-Wing spacecraft."

### Facebook Comments:
- Cassandra: "He got to the answer. 15!"
- Daisy: "Parrot is 15 (inches, poor tiny man)."
- Hillary: Concerned about why the pirate looks like Matt Walsh

## 4. DAILY NEWSLETTER: Her Homeschool Has Uniforms
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/her-homeschool-has-uniforms
**Published:** 2026-01-12
**Type:** Daily Newsletter
**Summary:** An NFL player's wife homeschools 6 kids. They wear uniforms. School runs 7 to 7. Meanwhile, a quarter-million kids left New York schools.

### THOUGHT: The 7-to-7 Schoolhouse

Business Insider profiled Tamela Gill Davis, wife of New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis. Six kids, ages 1-12. Homeschools all of them.

School runs 7am to 7pm. **The kids wear uniforms Monday through Thursday.** She hired a second teacher.

Why uniforms? "It's a way of teaching professional development. It's very important to show up in the world in a way that reflects who you are."

The message to the kids: **"We're the team."**

### TREND: The 250K Question

New York state lost a quarter-million K-12 students over the past decade. Almost 90% of districts shrank. NYC alone dropped 187,000 from traditional public schools - 19% decline.

Cornell demographers blame aging population, fewer children.

But: Charter enrollment more than doubled. Homeschooling doubled. Private school ticked up.

If this were just about birth rates, all categories would shrink proportionally. They didn't.

### TOOL: Habitica
Free app that turns tasks into an RPG. Complete math? Earn gold. Finish chores? Level up. Skip responsibilities? Power level takes a hit.

Why it works for resistant kids:
- Novelty (ADHD brains crave it)
- Visible progress (XP bars)
- Social accountability (join parties)

# ✨Falling in Love with Learning: A Joyful, Rigorous Guide to the Preschool Years
Dr. Claire Honeycutt🕊️❤️ (1)

I get messages every week from parents of three- and four-year-olds who are already worried.
Should my child know letters yet?
Are we behind in math?
Do I need a curriculum—now?

Not so long ago, I felt exactly the same way. Early childhood feels high-stakes. We’re told these years matter most, but we’re rarely told how to use them wisely.

Here’s the truth I wish someone had told me sooner:

Preschool isn’t about covering content.
It’s about shaping a relationship with learning.
I’ll never forget the first time I walked into a real Montessori classroom. The room was calm—but alive. Children were deeply absorbed in their work. Serious. And yet unmistakably…. happy.

I knew instantly, this is what I wanted for my children. It also clarified something for me. We’ve been handed a false choice: either a childhood full of joy or a serious education.

But why not both?

My girls & me
Joy and rigor aren’t opposites. They belong together.
Long before children encounter assignments, grades, or expectations, they are already answering a much deeper question:

Is learning a place I belong?

The early years shape whether learning feels meaningful or burdensome, whether effort feels satisfying or threatening.

The best preschool education teaches children that learning as alive, serious, and joyful work.

What follows isn’t a checklist. It’s a way of living that helps children fall in love with learning itself.

May it bring joyful learning into your home.

✨Language: Falling in Love with Words & Books
A baby’s first love is their mother’s voice.

From birth, infants prefer their mother’s voice—and their native language—over all others. That shouldn’t surprise us. For nine months, a single rhythm of speech was their whole world. In this way, a child’s first relationship with learning is forged through language. The preschool years should work with this instinct.

Here’s how to turn a love of language into a love of literacy.

An old picture of my (then) 3 year old “reading”
Read Real Books from the Beginning
I read to my children before they could lift their heads. They turned board book pages before they could crawl (see video of my then 3 month old turning board book pages with Dad). Reading with you baby on your lap forges a special relationship with books. They will feel warm, special, and somehow also resemble love.

Reading to your children alone puts a child ahead—but if you want to build a deep and lasting relationship with language, read them classics.

Classics don’t talk down to children. They trust them with rich syntax and beautiful words. Children don’t have to understand everything to absorb the cadence of language.

This early exposure quietly builds the neural foundations for reading, vocabulary, and writing years down the road. It feels natural to learn this way because it’s aligned with typical brain development.

(My favorite read-aloud lists included below & yes Beatrix Potter will be on it!)

Read your children classics!
Let Them Memorize What They Love
Many children memorize favorite books. Some parents worry this isn’t really reading - and it’s not - but it’s doing something just as important.

Memorization trains attention, strengthens memory, and turns vocabulary into something active. When children repeat big, beautiful words aloud, those words become theirs (transforming passive vocabulary into active usage).

One of my favorite memories is waking up to my oldest “reading” to my youngest—reciting a beloved story from memory with total confidence and delight.

It’s these moments that life comes full circle. They love to read to their siblings because you read to them. Reading is such a gift.

Add Poetry Early
If you want to elevate reading and their future writing, bring poetry into your home.

Poetry trains the ear to the rhythm, cadence, and beauty of words. It teaches children that how something sounds matters. Years later, you’ll see this play out in their writing. They’ll know that how they say something matters.

It will also make Shakespeare feel like a familiar friend.

Think Beyond Fiction — Read the World
Preschoolers loves stories (who doesn’t?) — but they are also hungry for the world. Charlotte Mason style living books, especially in history and science, teach children that knowledge is connected and alive.

One of our favorites is Mossy, a sweeet story of a tortoise, that introduces children to the flora and fauna of the natural world, with gorgeous illustrations on every page (picture below).

Be sure to have a few of these vibrant books about your home - or go to your library and get a new set every few weeks! That was how we did it in our small home.

Let learning spill over into coloring pages, sketching, or observations of the world around them and you teach them that the everything is worth learning about.

Each page has beautiful illustrations around the edge themed in the natural world - this one fungi
Use Audiobooks as Apprenticeship
Car rides are not a preschooler’s best friend—but audiobooks can make them very sweet.

We listened to books constantly in the car, but not just any books. We listened to classic narrators with rich voices that modeled dramatic orations. Both of my kids picked up a wee bit of an English accent during their early years because we listened to so many great English classics.

Great orators teach children how language moves: pacing, inflection, emotion.

As an aside, audiobooks trained my children that cars and trips are places for reading. To this day, my children never go anywhere without a book—even short trips — reading becomes a natural part of your daily rhythm.

Invite Real Reading—Don’t Rush It
Every child shows interest in reading at a different moment. When that moment comes, be ready to JUMP!

Have gentle early readers that integrate phonics on hand (my favorite one pictured below & I’ll give you the resource at the end). Find some that introduce 3-4 letters at a time and then immediately put them into a story. Having a set of these around the house for that moment - and it will come - that your little says I wanna read it myself! They have to learn just 3-4 letters and boom! They are reading a REAL book!

From this early beginning, they’ll grow and blossom so fast.

Read a whole story with FOUR letters!
Early reading should feel like an invitation — don’t be surprised when your 2-3 year old shows interest — especially if their older sibling is already reading too.

PS. Don’t forget to play the “word game”. Ask kids what word am I saying? Then say the sounds slowly for a word.. Ex: the sound for the letters “c” “a” and “t” slowly. Do NOT do this in the context of reading but as a GAME! Learning to put together phonemes into words is essential to early reading.

✨Curiosity: Protecting Wonder & Encouraging Questions
Children are born curious—and then, too often, trained out of it.

Study after study shows that children ask fewer questions as they age. Your job is to protect their curiosity and keep the flame burning bright.

Children rarely say, I’d like a science lesson now.

But they often say: Why does the moon change shape?
What are clouds made of?
Why do things fall down?

Questions are the curriculum! Two key ways to encourage and build a foundation of curiosity in your home are….

Wonder Out Loud Together
When your child asks a question—whether you know the answer or not—pause and wonder with them.

That’s a great question?
I don’t know—let’s find out.
Why do you think it happens?

Model the process. Let them see how knowledge is built. By doing this, you teach that questions are not interruptions; they are the beginning of every learning journey.

Teach Them Observation
Help children learn to see — really see things. Start with the sky. Then trees. Then insects. Music. Art. Texture. Color. Shape.

Ask what they notice. Give them sketchbooks. Let them trace leaves, press flowers, draw imperfect, abstract representations of what they observe.

The ability to truly see serves children for life—in science, art, and writing.

I believe so strongly in this I wrote a whole post about it The Path to Polymath: Teach Your Kids to Think Like Renaissance Geniuses.

✨Math: Making Patterns Feel Friendly
Math is often where children first learn to fear being wrong.

It doesn’t have to be.

Your goal in the early years is to help math feel useful, playful, and satisfying to explore.

Build the Brain with Hands
To the brain, math is visual (yes, you read that right). Technically, it’s visuospatial.

Children who have a strong visuospatial working memory perform better in every domain of math.

All those hours spent building, cutting and rearranging, folding paper, solving puzzles, or learning finger crafts are quietly training the brain systems math relies on later. This work matters more than we’re often led to believe—so don’t rush past it.

(You can read more deeply on this topic in Improve Your Child’s Math — Without Doing Math. I’ve included a full activity list below & in that article.)

No old train & block photos to be found—so masks they made it is. Take pictures of these sweet moments, friends - they go fast!
Make Math Musical🎶
Songs teach pattern effortlessly.

I’ll never forget singing multiplication tables in the car with my girls. I was teaching my eight-year-old, but my five-year-old sang right along:
“4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48-leaf clovers…” I can’t even write that without singing the song in my head. Be sure to count all the things in your life along with these songs!

Sesame Street was onto something friends.

Music makes structure feel safe. Patterns feel playful. Memorization of math facts later becomes easier because the relationships are already familiar.

✨Practical Life: Real Work that Builds Confidence
Children so want to be helpful.

Nearly every veteran homeschooler I’ve interviewed on the podcast—and Maria Montessori herself—emphasized the importance of children participating in the work of a household.

Invite Them into Real Work
Children don’t want pretend chores. They want real ones.

These tasks quietly build confidence: I can bake muffins. I can sweep. I can contribute.

For a three-year-old, sweeping the floor is play. Lean into it!

And yes, it won’t actually be helpful at first - but it’s teaching them when work is real, it’s meaningful - and searching for meaningful work becomes the cadence of their future.

An old picture of my then 3 & 6 year olds “helping” me cook - with a princess crown on no less!
Protect Focused Work Time
One of the most striking features of Montessori classrooms is their alive, yet serious work periods.

I worked hard to cultivate that in my home—not perfectly, but deliberately.

Over time, it became the natural rhythm of our day. Even on vacation, I often find my children quietly doing morning “work”: reading, drawing, crafting. As I write this, it’s Saturday morning and they are listening to an audiobook while making historical paper dolls. I didn’t suggest it to them, it’s simply how they want their day to begin.

My current 9yo making historical paper dolls on Saturday morning
A three-year-old can tolerate a surprisingly long work block—two hours is not unreasonable when the work is varied and shared. Choose a consistent time of day (after breakfast works well). Build blocks, sing counting songs, read together. Include chores. Whatever you do, make it intentional.

Protected “work” time teaches children what it feels like to begin, sustain, and complete meaningful work.

✨Multiple Languages: Keeping Young Brains Flexible & Open
Young children hear the full range of human sound. But between roughly 18 months and 3 years of age, their perception begins to narrow — a natural part of learning one’s native language.

Exposure to multiple languages keeps the brain flexible. It makes future language learning easier—and richer.

If you have a native speaker at home, use it fully: talk, sing, read. If not, it’s never been easier to find songs, stories, and audiobooks online. Exposure alone shapes the brain.

To young children, this feels like play. And it is.

I’ll be writing more about this soon as it’s close to my heart.

✨Unstructured Play: Where Learning Becomes Their Own
Finally, protect what cannot be scheduled.

So far, we’ve focused on building a relationship with the work of learning, but a relationship with play matters just as much.

Decades of research show that unstructured physical and imaginative play helps children regulate their bodies, emotions, and attention.

Play must not be scripted. It should belong entirely to the child.

Here, learning becomes theirs.

Things my children made during unstructured play
✨Final Thoughts
Read the real books, welcome the questions, wonder together, sing math songs, share the real work, guard the play.

Do this, and you give your child something no curriculum can buy:
a heart in love with learning.
🌺And that love will carry them—steadily, delightfully—farther than you can imagine.

# Homeschool proposal closing exploited loophole unanimously advances - Education - The Black Chronicle (1)

![](https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/8d/a8d5ee48-3483-4f55-965e-004707bbf2f2/693083313ee72.preview.jpg)

(The Center Square) – Ending a loophole for discrimination by colleges and universities across the nation against homeschool students is a step closer to reality through a North Carolina congressman’s proposal.

The Homeschool Graduation Recognition Act has passed the Education and Workforce Committee 33-0 in the U.S. House of Representatives. House Resolution 6392, as it is also known, ensures fair treatment of prospective higher education student applications regardless of homeschool background.

The “markup of my bipartisan bill, the Homeschool Graduation Recognition Act, is an important step toward ending discrimination against homeschooled students,” Harris said in a statement. “If a homeschool graduate meets or exceeds the very same academic standards as a public-school graduate, they deserve equal treatment under the law – no exceptions, no excuses.”

Harris says many universities require excessive documentation and additional testing.

Total students being homeschooled in Harris’ native North Carolina is unclear. According to the U.S. Census, it’s 10% of nearly 4 million. According to the Non-Public Education’s division for the state, in 2024-25 it is estimated 165,243 students are being educated in 101,880 homeschools. The latter estimate is conservative in context to homeschools with students below the age of 7 by law not having to officially open as a school.

The Home School Legal Defense Association, led by President Jim Mason, favors the legislation.

He said in a statement, “The [Home School Graduation Recognition Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/6392?s=1&r=2) will eliminate ambiguity, prevent ongoing misinterpretation, and ensure equal treatment for homeschool graduates by clarifying that homeschool graduates meet the definition of high school graduates for federal student aid purposes.”

### **Hey, y’all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. What does it mean to be a “normal” kid? (Part Two)
2. Scholar’s Sources: Motivation in 2026

I hope everyone had a good first full week of 2026! Despite taking four math classes this quarter, I’ve had an extremely fun week, as I’m lucky enough to be on a dorm trip to Lake Tahoe right now. I’ve spent the past few days teaching my friends how to ski and drinking lots of hot chocolate and ignoring two problem sets I really should’ve already started working on. This new year is definitely going to test my organizational and motivational abilities (see: four math classes), so stay tuned for any learnings or updates on that :)

### What does it mean to be a “normal” kid? (Part Two)

Welcome to part two of our three-part series on Matt Bateman’s framework of child development. This time, we’re examining elementary-age children (6-12) and dismantling the myth that intellectual rigor and childhood joy are one-or-the-other opposites. The truth about children’s cognitive capacity during these years is far more complex, and far more hopeful, than current norms would have us believe.

Consider for a moment the cultural archetype of the elementary school child that Matt Bateman identifies in his presentation: Calvin, the titular character of the beloved comic strip, a perpetually daydreaming character who battles authority, despises school, and retreats into elaborate fantasy worlds rather than engaging with his classroom work. We laugh at his antics, we relate to his rebellion, and most importantly, we accept this pattern of disengagement as a normal, even inevitable, aspect of childhood development.

But when we normalize this archetype, we’re actually accepting the suppression of children’s natural intellectual appetite during the very years when their neuroplasticity is at its peak and their capacity for deep, sustained learning is perhaps greater than it will ever be again.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZCiQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe53094f-b917-4a96-aa41-64c551bb4af9_2048x1034.png)

Bateman’s research reveals something important about this developmental stage, and his insights should fundamentally alter how we conceptualize elementary education: Children between six and twelve exist in what he terms “the age of explanations and reasons,” a period characterized not by simple curiosity but by an intense, almost compulsive drive to construct comprehensive mental models of reality that explain not just isolated facts but entire systems of interconnected phenomena.

The tragedy that unfolds daily in classrooms across America is that we respond to children’s magnificent cognitive hunger with fragmented, time-boxed lessons that actively prevent the very type of deep, systematic understanding that children’s brains are primed to achieve during these crucial years.

Perhaps the most striking claim in Matt’s presentation, one that should stop every parent and educator in their tracks, is that elementary children naturally engage in rigorous scholarly work when their development proceeds normally.

Not that they “can be taught to” engage in such work. Not that they are “capable of” such engagement, but that they *default* *to* asking questions, constructing mental models, and absorbing concepts with dedication and joy when adults don’t actively interfere with this natural process.

Consider the child who memorizes not just the names of Pokemon but the types, evolution chains, statistical attributes, and battle strategies of hundreds of characters, maintaining and constantly updating a complex mental database that requires sophisticated categorical thinking, pattern recognition, and information management skills that rival anything we attempt to teach in our most ambitious elementary curricula.

Matt’s description of the normal elementary student reframes how we think of intellectual development: The healthy elementary-age child doesn’t have fleeting interests that shift with each passing week, but rather develops what can only be described as research agendas that span months or even years. When a student studies horses, she’s not just learning “facts.” She’s constructing a multidisciplinary understanding that spans evolutionary biology, anatomy, physics (the biomechanics of gait), history (the role of cavalry in warfare), and ethics (contemporary debates about training methods). She reads primary sources. She evaluates conflicting theories. She generates original hypotheses.

This is scholarly work. The content may be horses or Pokemon rather than postcolonial theory, but the cognitive processes are identical.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z1OV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c0de7a-7166-402f-9fdd-e6d016dd9408_1036x942.png)

One of Matt’s most counterintuitive claims concerns executive function. Elementary children, he argues, can and should be planning their own time. Not following schedules, but creating them.

The normal elementary child, with minimal scaffolding, develops sophisticated project management skills. She thinks in weeks, not hours. She allocates resources. She anticipates obstacles. She adjusts when reality doesn’t match her projections.

I’ve observed this phenomenon at Alpha School: Eight-year-olds maintaining complex schedules they’ve designed themselves, making strategic decisions about when to tackle difficult content (first thing in the morning, when cognitive resources are fresh) versus writing and reading (before lunch, when their imagination is already working).

Yet most elementary students never experience genuine agency over their own time. Every minute is scheduled by adults. Every transition is managed externally. Then we pathologize their inability to self-regulate as teenagers, never recognizing that we systematically prevented them from developing these capabilities when their brains were the most plastic.

I laid out some play doh, a treasure box, and gem stamps expecting my little to make jewelry and treasure while I cleaned. The youngling surprised me by rolling and cutting out coins to fill their treasure box. The coins were different colors and sizes and some had holes in the center. We ended up pulling out a book and discussing the value of coins and ancient coins. The little started noticing the different designs on coins around the world and was inspired to pull out a pencil and draw on their own play doh coins. We talked about minting and watched a brief video about how coins are made. Kiddo went back to playing with their coins, decided their value, and then we had a game of math and toy shopping.

# Homeschool mom of two older kids, trying to share some wisdom : r/homeschool (1)

I just wanted to add another voice of encouragement here. Homeschooling can and will be messy at times but stick it through and your kids will thank you for it (I hope). I can break down the things that need to be maintained while homeschooling your kids:
- Set a schedule that leaves room for flexibility but resembles a school day
- Set goals/expectations, grade fairly and make sure these are sustainable for your kid to keep working hard and achieving
- Carve out time within the schedule to let your kid explore the subjects they are more interested in (do some more hands on projects/learning on their own)
- Find community - make sure your kids aren't struggling socially and are maintaining friendships and meeting new people (that are their age!) constantly.

I hope this helps and I'll try my best to answer any other questions here!

# How decision fatigue is wearing down your homeschool (1)

![](https://simplehomeschool.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/decisionfatiguepicmo.jpg)

*How decision fatigue is wearing down your homeschool*
*~ Written by [**Sarah Mackenzie**](https://simplehomeschool.net/author/sarahm/) of [**Read-Aloud Revival**](https://readaloudrevival.com/start-here/)*

![](https://simplehomeschool.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-31-at-5.59.02-PM.png)

It’s 11am. The twins are emptying the tea cupboard onto the floor, the 2 year-old is fussing, and I’m standing at the fridge, trying to decide what to make for lunch. Just then my 11 year-old walks into the room. **“What should I be doing right now?”**

As the volume of the din steadily rises, the 9 year-old whizzes past me, flinging his math book onto the kitchen counter and tossing a comment about making a break for the basement. Somebody pulls on my pant leg and I rub my head.

“Mom? What am I supposed to be do
ing?” She’s getting more persistent.

“I… don’t know,” I sigh, exasperated, “Just… we’ll figure it out later.”

Sound familiar? **It’s a classic case of homeschooling mama decision fatigue, and I can predict it’s arrival in my house (and yours!) like clockwork every day of the week.**

## How decision fatigue is wearing down your homeschool

By now enough studies have proven that making decisions is exhausting, and **as a homeschooling mom, you’re probably making a whole lot more of them than you realize.**

My friend Pam came to this conclusion not too long ago. She was recently trying out [my spiral notebook hack](https://readaloudrevival.com/spiral-notebooks-for-homeschool/) and said that as she sat and wrote out those checklists, she made about 20 different decisions that she hadn’t at all anticipated.

“These were 20 decisions that were now already made and did not have to be made in the heat of the moment while we were doing school,” she said.

Here’s why I think those spiral notebooks work so well: They force us to make decisions ahead of time, before we’re knee-deep in a busy homeschool day, thereby reducing our in-the-moment stress and frustration. We don’t have to decide every little detail in the throes of a hot moment because most of it has already been decided. [Exhale.]

### **So how does a homeschooling mom actually combat decision fatigue?**

If we have a million decisions to make each day, how do we set ourselves up for success? I’m pretty sure I can’t avoid decision fatigue entirely, but here are a few ways I’m minimizing the number of decisions I make in the heat of a homeschool day.

![](https://simplehomeschool.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_0238-1.jpg)

### **1. Write out assignments the night before.**

I’m currently doing this using [simple spiral notebooks](https://readaloudrevival.com/spiral-notebooks-for-homeschool/), and I can’t believe how much more productive we’ve been in our little homeschool since implementing them. I’ve come to realize a hard truth about myself: when the house is loud (and it is always is) and the day is long (and it often is), I tend to default to, “That’s enough for today. Class dismissed.”

**It’s hard for me to be objective about what a reasonable amount of work is when I’m being bombarded with requests for crackers and help over a grammar lesson.**

Writing out each child’s lessons the night before has made all the difference.

![](https://simplehomeschool.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_0121-1.jpg)

**2. Make a schedule and (try to) stick with it for a set amount of time.**

Choose a length of time to make your “term,” if that’s helpful, and then just be as consistent as you can be for its duration. You aren’t committing to a whole year or even a quarter- just try 4 or 6 weeks!

**A schedule is just another way of narrowing choices,** and narrowing choices reduces decision fatigue. Once your term is over, adjust your schedule as necessary- you’ve given it a fair shot by this point, and it very well may need a little mindful tweaking.

![](https://simplehomeschool.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_0925-2.jpg)

### **3. Put ideas into a queue.**

To counteract my incredibly impulsive nature, I’ve started a discipline of recording ideas into a place I call “The Idea Shelf.”

Stop laughing, it’s a real thing. It’s just a sheet of paper in my notebook, really, but it’s a *very, very important* sheet of paper.  Here’s how it works: **Whenever I get the urge to change directions or toss one curriculum in favor of another, I write it down on my Idea Shelf page first.**

![](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/svg/1f609.svg)

I write the idea and the date it burst into my brain, and then I let it sit. If I wait a week before doing anything with it, I end up saving myself a lot of headaches (and often a lot of money, if my brilliant idea was buying something new!).

The things that really do need to change- that math curriculum that’s just not working, or the grammar book that is about to melt my 12 year old into a puddle of woe- are still a good idea a week later.

If it’s just some bright shiny curriculum I’ve seen from someone else (and must! try! right! away!), I may not feel so exuberant about it a week later and can cross it off entirely.

![](https://simplehomeschool.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_0912-11.jpg)

**4. Encourage your kids to eat their frogs first thing.**

There’s an old saying that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a frog, it’s probably the worst thing you’ll do all day.

Basically, it tells us that **tackling the most challenging task of the day can free up a lot of mental space and energy and help us get more done.**

Your kids are at just as much risk for decision fatigue as you are. I tend to let my kids choose which order to tackle their daily assignments, but I encourage them to choose the hardest/most loathsome task first (math, anyone?).

It can be so freeing to know that your hardest task is already done for the day by 9 or 10 am, and you may find your kids making better (more cheerful) decisions if they get their frog swallowed bright and early.

**What have you done to reduce decision fatigue in your homeschool?**

# From Marksmanship to Baking, Homeschooling Helps Brothers Hone Skills (1)

![](https://hslda.org/images/librariesprovider2/images/articles/lee-brothers-state-capitol-resized.jpg?sfvrsn=a7afbbd1_2)

**News**

January 13, 2026

If you’ve ever questioned whether homeschooling empowers students to explore a wide range of opportunities and engage with people outside their families, a visit to the Lee family home in North Dakota would quickly change your mind.

Assuming the four older Lee boys aren’t busy honing their air rifle marksmanship or baking prize-winning cakes, they would be happy to display the medals they’ve earned pursuing these and many other exploits. They’ll also regale you with stories of the individuals they’ve met in competitions and other excursions that have taken them across the state and beyond.

“We still get people who assume that because our kids are homeschooled that they are isolated,” Sarah Peterson-Lee said. “We try very hard to stay connected to the community.”

Sarah and her husband have homeschooled Nolan, 13, Tanner, 11, Zane, 10, Xavier, 8, and Thaddeus, 7, since preschool. Even before they had children, Sarah added, she and her husband were convinced homeschooling was the right choice for them.

“We believe parents are the ones best suited to teach their children,” she said.

To secure hands-on opportunities as a way to augment her sons’ core academics, Sarah has sometimes had to take the lead herself.

She recalled, for example, “I wanted to give the kids access to STEM and robotics.” When nothing suitable turned up for homeschooled students, Sarah launched a LEGO robotics club. “I was the coach even though I don’t know a lick about robotics,” Sarah quipped.

![](https://hslda.org/images/librariesprovider2/images/articles/nolan-and-tanner-robotics-team.jpg?sfvrsn=f1afbbd1_1)

Nolan and Tanner pose with teammates after winning the state Lego robotics regional qualifier.

The club entered competitions to build and program robots to perform certain functions within a set amount of time. A team consisting of Nolan, Tanner, and two other homeschooled students ended up winning their regional tournament with one of the highest point totals in the state. And the entire experience counted as a homeschool science project!

## Teaming up with others

Though the robotics team she helped launch succeeded beyond her expectations, Sarah added that it’s beneficial to work with existing organizations when possible.

![](https://hslda.org/images/librariesprovider2/images/articles/tanner-5k-run.jpg?sfvrsn=8aebbd1_2)

Tanner celebrates after winning a 5k run.

For example, when her son Xavier expressed an interest in running track, Sarah connected him with USA Track and Field (USATF). This organization schedules meets nationwide with the goal of identifying athletes who can represent the US in international competition, including the Olympics. The structured environment has helped Xavier excel. At a recent regional USATF event he qualified for the youth national meet (9–10-year-olds) in the 400m run. He also had the chance to meet an American Master’s Record Holder in the 10,000m, April Lund.

The Lees have also tapped into 4-H for a number of activities. Nolan, Tanner, and Zane won state championships as part of two separate 4-H air rifle teams. In addition, Tanner and Zane qualified for the state finals in communications arts for their dramatic reading of one of the *Frog and Toad* children’s books by Arnold Lobel. Nolan tasted victory again when his red velvet cake earned grand champion honors at the state fair. Tanner’s homemade angel food cake garnered a blue honor. Nolan also garnered Best of Division in the State Fair Open Class for his black currants berry submission.

![](https://hslda.org/images/librariesprovider2/images/articles/zane-and-xavier-horses.jpg?sfvrsn=10aebbd1_1)

Zane and Xavier ride horses as part of a 4-H project.

The family’s small hobby farm also inspires some of the brothers’ other extracurricular pursuits. Nolan was named 4-H reserve champion in poultry showmanship, an accomplishment in keeping with the Lees’ raising chickens and other domestic fowl. Zane received Reserve Champion in his equivalent of the County Fair for Rabbit Showmanship, and Tanner, who has hatched some heritage turkeys of his own, received Grand Champion in the Turkey division for his broad-breasted turkey.

Zane has also shown an aptitude for tending livestock. Recently he intervened when one of the ewes in the family’s small flock was struggling to give birth. Zane helped reposition the lamb while it was still in utero. The ewe delivered safely, and Zane was so elated by the outcome that he insisted on sleeping with the newborn two nights in a row.

Soon afterward, Zane applied for a grant program with the North Dakota Lamb and Wool Producers Association. Based on his answers to a brief application, Zane qualified for a loan and 10 sheep of his own.

Nolan poses with his ribbon and prize-winning bird.

## Pleased to meet you

Sarah said another reason she strives to keep her sons involved in extracurriculars is the opportunity they provide to meet other people. For example, this year she took her sons to the State Capitol for a homeschool rally day. There they were introduced to Gov. Kelly Armstrong. They also participated in the TeenPact leadership camp where they created a bill and worked on honing public speaking skills while praying for those making decisions.

Thanks to the skills of a local artist who put on an art camp for the boys to supplement their coursework, Thaddeus, then 5, entered his painting of an Arizona landscape and came home with Best of Show at a recent homeschooling convention.

Thanks to another youth program, the Lee boys put their hands to curling with an athlete who has earned Olympic medals competing in the winter sport.

“At the end of our first lesson,” Sarah recalled, “he asked if the boys had curled before. He told them they curl like pros!”

Not all their activities are this novel. This fall, Sarah said, for general physical fitness they’ve decided to simply bowl as a family.

“We found something that works for us and is flexible,” she explained. When it comes to selecting the right events to augment homeschooling, Sarah added, “you always have to pick and choose and realize some things are for a season.”

For homeschooling families who are looking to expand opportunities for their kids, Sarah said the important thing is to make connections and get creative.

“It’s easy to just do things that are in your wheelhouse,” she noted. “But don’t be afraid to ask questions and reach out. You may even need to find people who can think outside the box.”

Ultimately, she concluded, parents should remember that any skills they and their children acquire through new experiences don’t just benefit themselves—they enrich the community.

# **Why fewer toys can mean calmer kids** (1)

Coach Meg Thomas by Meg Thomas / Jan 9, 2026 at 4:12 PM

Logo
Dear Charlie Deist,

Can I talk about something that so many families struggle with — but don't always feel comfortable admitting?

Toy clutter.

Not just the mess… but the overstimulation, the scattered play, the constant cleanup, and the feeling that your home never quite settles.
In today's podcast episode, I answer a thoughtful question from a mom who shared that her family does best with much less clutter — especially toys — but struggles with:

- constant gifted toys
• toy rotation that never quite sticks
• explaining “less” to young children
• communicating boundaries with family
• and the guilt that comes with letting toys go

This conversation is deeply inspired by the book Simplicity Parenting by Kim John Payne and the idea that a child's environment has a powerful effect on their nervous system, attention, and emotional regulation.

Here's the heart of the episode:
✨ Fewer toys don't deprive children — they support them.
✨ Calm environments help children play more deeply and regulate more easily.
✨ Parents are allowed to lead their homes with clarity and confidence.

If clutter has been weighing on you — even if it feels like a “small” issue — this episode will help you:
• understand why less matters
• decide which toys to keep and which to release
• communicate boundaries around gifts
• guide young children through letting toys go
• create an environment that supports peace, not chaos

You're not failing because your home feels overwhelmed.
You're noticing what your family needs — and that's leadership.

# Why Boredom is Good And How to Encourage It (1)

The words, “I’m bored” can lead to guilt in even the most attentive parent. Given all of the scheduled activities, enrichment tutors, and a desire to give our children endless attention, a moment of downtime can feel like a missed opportunity, or worse, a sign that we’re not connecting enough. Let’s reframe, “I’m bored” into a sign you are doing something right.

[In the latest episode of the Raising Good Humans Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/independent-play-play-pockets-and-what-to-do-when/id1473072044?i=1000743489430), I’m joined by education expert, Lizzie Assa, founder of [The Workspace for Children](https://www.instagram.com/theworkspaceforchildren/?hl=en) who offers practical, concrete ways for parents to foster this essential life skill. Soon you are going to start to feel a little thrill when you hear the words “I’m bored”!

When a child announces they are bored, the first instinct many parents have is to jump in to entertain or offer up suggestions. We can also accidentally shame kids by calling out their boredom, and then threatening them with chores or throwing all of their toys out the window. Instead, let’s reframe this moment entirely. While this moment often triggers the insecurity of, “*Am I not doing enough,”* Lizzie explains that, “I’m bored” is typically a bid for connection, not a request for a cruise ship director. If we can step back from that defensive feeling, we can guide our child without taking over their play.

Instead of snapping an instinctual retort, follow this sequence:

1. Check basic needs

At any age, the basics still matter. Taking a moment to check-in means you’re not likely to overreact to circumstances that a granola bar could have solved.

- Are they hungry?
- Are they overtired?
- Have we had even just a few minutes of connection today?

2. Validate and co-regulate

If basic needs are met, your next step is validation and co-regulation. Instead of getting anxious about their boredom, your job is to stay calm and help them feel comfortable with the feeling.

- Validate by saying something like, “Boredom is a good thing. I don’t think you really want me to tell you what to do, but I can help you think of what to do.”
- Co-regulate by keeping your anxiety in check. If you can be calm about their boredom, it helps calm them. Avoid feeding them a list of ideas as this will likely result in a string of “No”s.

3. Scaffold the thinking

Once they’re calm, gently guide them toward their own ideas. Lizzie emphasizes “keeping the ball in their court” by scaffolding their thinking based on their known interests or recent activities. The goal is to bridge the gap between “I’m bored” and an idea that originates from them, not you. This builds confidence around play.

- Remind them of something they were working on before that was interrupted, or something they were loving but had to leave behind. For instance, “I remember you were building that incredible magnetic tile castle yesterday, and you were so disappointed you had to stop for soccer. Do you think that’s something you might want to do right now?”
- Use a current interest to inspire play. “You were telling me about that Bluey episode in the car today. I wonder if you want to get your Bluey toys and play about that episode?

There are so many benefits of play for a child’s growth and development (you can listen to some episodes [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/einstein-never-used-flash-cards-how-our-children-really/id1473072044?i=1000740970030) and [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-play-is-so-crucial-for-development-the-science/id1473072044?i=1000705811664), and [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s2-ep-20-unleashing-the-power-of-play-with/id1473072044?i=1000537948743)!). I love the way Lizzie describes how play also offers the goals parents are actually striving for when they over-schedule. These are things like executive function skills, confidence, resilience, and persistence. When children are constantly being told what to do and when, they miss opportunities to develop these skills. Independent play, where the idea is truly led by the child, gives them the practice they need for the future.

[Share](https://dralizapressman.substack.com/p/why-boredom-is-good-and-how-to-encourage?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNjc4NTkyNDcsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE4MTg0MDcwNywiaWF0IjoxNzY4MzQyNTIxLCJleHAiOjE3NzA5MzQ1MjEsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMjMwMTg3Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.43UDAN2xWt50AdU_OyUQNsYLvH8VYXywF1vNBxxl-sE)

To support this kind of play, parents have to shift from trying to be the leader to becoming the observer.

- Step back and observe what the child is already noticing, whether it’s a shadow on the wall or the rolling of a rattle. Your role is to reflect, not interrupt: “Oh, you see how that rattle is rolling?” You want your child to run the show.
- Mirror them by trying to see yourself as an extra, supporting the lead actor. This helps children to build their own skills so that you can slowly start to step back.
- Schedule downtime with the same fierceness that you would for that soccer game. Having enough downtime is essential to facilitate play AND an important way for children to get used to, and comfortable with, being in their own skin and being bored.

One way that Lizzie suggests parents facilitate independent play is by creating “play pockets.” A Play Pocket is where you place a small, intentional collection of simple, well-loved toys in the spots where you need your child to be independent.

- Example 1: The Bathroom Cabinet. During bath time, when you have other children who need to be occupied, a low bathroom cabinet can be stocked with small cars, mini blocks, and figurines instead of towels.
- Example 2: The Kitchen Drawer. A kitchen drawer can be filled with a few simple, safe toys, encouraging your children to play at your feet while you cook or clean.
- Example 3: The Laundry Room. Clearing a bottom shelf in the laundry room for a few books, magnetic tiles, and even a bin of rags, so the child can fold alongside you, may be a game changer for your ability to get things done!

It’s also helpful to think about removing barriers to independent play in your home. Keeping art supplies in a high cabinet, or games under the couch, can make it hard for your child to get started with play. Leaving them out in certain locations, or making sure they are easily available, can be a game changer for families with young children. There is always something to play with!

By changing our perspective on boredom and making small, intentional shifts in our home and our playtime role, we can build the play confidence our children need, and in the process, independent play can change the culture of your family, and offer some much needed relief for you.

# As School Choice Programs Grow, Parents Are Demanding Better Customer Service (1)

![](https://www.the74million.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tennessee-ESA-825x494.png?cb=1026324)

As states continue to launch and expand [private school choice programs](https://www.the74million.org/tag/education-savings-accounts/), one of their biggest challenges is building online platforms that meet the overwhelming demand. 

Tennessee families experienced a bottleneck earlier this year as they waited [hours online](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/more-than-30k-applications-submitted-on-first-day-of-tennessee-school-voucher-launch) to submit applications for the state’s new [Education Freedom Scholarship](https://www.tn.gov/education/efs.html) program. In July, [the state told](https://fox17.com/news/local/parents-in-tennessee-frustrated-as-state-funded-scholarships-revoked-due-to-error-bill-lee-vouchers-private-school-tuition) 166 parents that they had received a scholarship, only to alert them a few days later that the notification was a mistake. 

“It wasn’t the most ideal user experience,” said Heide Nesset, a senior fellow for the Beacon Center of Tennessee, a right-leaning think tank. But there was a “tight runway,” about three months, to get the program off the ground. 

With state leaders hoping to serve up to 70,000 students next year, they’re now [searching for a new vendor](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/generalservices/documents/cpo/rfp-updates/33101-26013FAS5/RFP_School%20Choice%20Program%20Management%20System%20(FY26-FY31)_FINAL.pdf). Proposals are due Friday.

But the rough start in Tennessee wasn’t an anomaly. All states with [education savings accounts](https://www.the74million.org/tag/education-savings-accounts/) have struggled to some extent with ensuring smooth transactions for families, whether that’s paying a school on time or ordering a homeschool curriculum. Some say the solution lies in picking more than one company to handle the increasing demand and improve customer service.

“If it’s one contract, I think the vendor is inherently trying to ensure that the state department has a really fantastic experience,” said Nesset, who is also the vice president of

implementation at the Yes. Every Kid. Foundation, a school choice advocacy organization. “If you have more than one [vendor], then they start competing, and families have the opportunity to make choices.”

Tennessee’s current vendor is Student First Technologies, which won [a contract in 2023](https://www.chalkbeat.org/tennessee/2023/8/10/23826610/tennessee-voucher-vendor-esa-student-first-technologies-classwallet-bill-lee/) to run a smaller ESA program in three counties. Earlier this year, the state [expanded the contract](https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Archives/Joint/committees/fiscal-review/contracts/2025/03-27-25/10.%20Education%20(SID3CAR%20CO%20dba%20Student%20First%20Technologies)%20Amend%202%20Redacted.pdf) with the Indiana-based company to manage the new statewide program, despite its problems in other states. 

In West Virginia, where Student First still operates the Hope Scholarship program, an ESA, homeschool families complain that they can’t access the platform on their phones and that approvals and denials for purchases are inconsistent. Arkansas canceled its contract with Student First last fall after it failed to deliver a “fully operational” system on time. The company paid the state [a $300,000 fine](https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2025/08/11/arkansas-department-of-education-claws-back-300k-in-damages-from-terminated-school-voucher-contract). 

### [Despite Breakdowns in Two States, ESA Provider Student First Seeks to Expand](https://www.the74million.org/article/despite-breakdowns-in-two-states-esa-provider-student-first-seeks-to-expand/)

### ‘Get what they need’

Eighteen states now have at least one ESA program. With a new federal tax credit scholarship system beginning in 2027, the demand for organizations to manage them will surely grow. The trick is delivering a system that runs smoothly for families while ensuring that they’re using the money the way the state intended. 

In a [recent interview](https://x.com/michaelbhorn/status/1992996754464162158?s=20), Michael Horn, cofounder of the Clayton Christensen Institute, a think tank, talked with Jamie Rosenberg, the founder of ClassWallet. Still the biggest player in the market, the Florida-based company manages nine ESA programs. 

Prior to platforms like his, states had two options, he explained. They either issued debit cards, which made it hard to ensure parents spent the money on allowable purchases, or expected them to pay up front and request reimbursement — a significant obstacle for families on a tight budget.

ESA vendors, he said, give families the “agency to get what they need but also the ease of knowing that what they’re doing and what they’re buying [complies with] program rules.”

Adding more than one vendor to the mix could make the companies work harder to reach lower-income and minority families who are less likely to use the programs, said Lisa Snell, a senior fellow at Stand Together Trust, which funds school choice initiatives.

“Family outreach and satisfaction become the goal rather than the government as the customer to one vendor,” she said.

### [In Arizona, the Typical ESA Recipient Already Attends Private School, Study Finds](https://www.the74million.org/article/in-arizona-the-typical-esa-recipient-already-attends-private-school-study-finds/)

Texas had the option to choose multiple vendors for its new ESA program, which launches next fall. [The law](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/pdf/SB00002E.pdf) allows the comptroller’s office to contract with up to five companies. But officials opted against it and awarded a two-year, $26 million contract to New York-based Odyssey, which currently runs programs in four other states. 

Joe Connor, Odyssey’s CEO declined to comment on the state’s decision and referred The 74 to the state comptroller’s office. The office did not respond, but Amar Kumar, CEO of KaiPod Learning, a large national network of microschools, said the state likely felt multiple vendors would further complicate the process.

“There was this huge question of the complexity of doing that,” he said. “How do you tell families which portal to go to or how will they decide who manages which part of the program?”

### ‘Send a quarterly check’

The vendor platforms include built-in tools to prevent misuse. Student First Technologies has an AI feature, [called QuinnIQ](https://www.studentfirsttech.com/quinniq#how-it-works), that reviews each expense, “assigns a confidence score” and flags anything that’s new or that the state hasn’t approved in the past. 

But Katie Switzer, a West Virginia parent using the state’s Hope Scholarship to homeschool her children, said it’s unreliable, sometimes approving purchases for some families and rejecting the same items for others. She thinks states should focus more on monitoring students’ academic progress than tracking every purchase. 

“It’s stupid in my opinion to micromanage down to like the $20 workbook level,” she said. “Honestly, I think it would be more cost effective to send a quarterly check to families.”

That’s unlikely with such programs constantly under the microscope, and critics, especially in Arizona, pointing to high-end purchases, like [diamonds and plane tickets](https://www.12news.com/article/news/investigations/i-team/education-impact/i-team-empowerment-scholarship-accounts-parents-bought-diamond-rings-luxury-clothing-kenmore-appliances-education-tax-dollars/75-dff40d1f-3a34-435c-9edc-af4150352445), as examples of misuse. The state education department says it takes steps to prevent fraud and has [referred cases](https://www.azed.gov/communications/esa-fraud-case-discovered-supt-horne%E2%80%99s-office-results-conviction) to the attorney general’s office that have [led to convictions](https://www.kvoa.com/news/man-sentenced-to-prison-for-defrauding-arizonas-esa-program/article_f77915e9-43ba-4ee1-93aa-cd31f5bdab36.html). 

West Virginia officials said they’re pleased with Student First’s progress since October, when [parents complained](https://wvmetronews.com/2025/10/12/purchasing-system-for-hope-scholarships-homeschool-families-again-churns-frustration/) that delayed orders caused students to fall behind on lessons. Orders are now “generally” processed within two business days, said Assistant Treasurer Carrie Hodousek, and the company has added and trained staff to prepare for peak order times.

Providers like Kaipod have their own concerns. School founders in the network have sometimes gone to the brink of eviction from their leased space because of late tuition payments, said CEO Kumar. 

“There should be a predictable schedule, but sometimes it can take weeks extra to get paid,” he said. “If you’re running a small business and you owe rent, you owe payroll and your state payment is delayed, that creates a huge amount of stress for founders.”

For now, rebidding contracts for vendors is the strongest form of accountability, he said.

“They ought to not feel safe once they’ve won a contract,” he said.

# The “à la carte education” accountability conundrum (1)

![](https://fordhaminstitute.org/sites/default/files/styles/featured_image_size/public/2024-09/mp-9-25-24.jpg?itok=Rt3ikVrw)

Of the school choice options available to many U.S. families today, few embody the spirit of “power to the parents” quite like education savings accounts (ESAs). ESAs allow parents who opt out of public schools to use taxpayer funds to purchase the educational resources of their choice for their children, ranging from private school tuition to homeschooling supplies to after-school tutoring and beyond. Advocates insist that ESAs represent a “[new frontier in education](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/education-savings-accounts-explained/2023/03),” where parents can handcraft their child’s academic journey à la carte, without navigating the constraints of the public school system—opening the door to hybrid homeschooling, microschools, and other versions of “unbundled learning.”

It sounds promising in theory, but there’s a big hitch: It is impossible to tie à la carte services to whether kids are actually learning anything. Some may try to deem this a non-issue issue, contending that “accountability to parents” is enough. But when taxpayer funds are involved, that can’t be the only answer. The reason we pitch in to pay for public education is that all of us benefit when all children—not just our own kids—are well-schooled and can access the knowledge needed to make their way successfully through life, ultimately ensuring the prosperity and security of the larger society.

To be clear, it’s quite possible, and in our view essential, to hold private schools accountable when parents use ESAs to pay tuition (which so far is how most of the money is, in fact, used). In a future post, we will tackle how such accountability can and should work for these schools. State lawmakers can also insist on an evaluation of an ESA program as a whole—which should include testing a sample of participating students and comparing their progress with similar peers.

But what sorts of quality control measures might prove feasible for à la carte services—in other words, everything ESAs can fund besides private school tuition? To begin to address this question, let’s examine the regulatory measures that some of these programs use to ensure basic accountability, such as protecting against waste, fraud, and abuse.

**A look at financial protections**

Like any taxpayer-funded initiative, ESAs can’t operate successfully without some guardrails. Of course, any facility serving children must ensure their physical safety, adhering to fire and health codes. But programs must also take steps to prevent vendors from defrauding families or wasting public money on services with no educational value—and they must ensure that parents can’t [misuse](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/cosmetics-and-clothes-parents-misspent-700-000-in-arizonas-school-choice-program/2018/11) their allotted funding.

Receipt submissions

States can help prevent fraud by designating an office to which participating families must submit receipts for their ESA purchases. This can take two forms: The state can ask parents to pay for their educational expenditures upfront, then provide reimbursements—or the state can distribute prepaid debit cards for families to use. Both have pluses and minuses. For example, asking parents to front the costs for their ESA purchases discourages wasteful spending, but it may also inhibit families with minimal disposable income from fully participating in the program.

In practice, however, this oversight system has led to major problems. One such example can be found in [Arizona](https://www.educationnext.org/many-more-states-enact-education-savings-accounts-implementation-challenges-abound-esas-choice-permitted-expenses/), where the department reviewing these receipts became so severely backlogged that wasted funds went unnoticed for months.

Limits on prepaid debit cards

Along with a requirement to submit receipts, [Arizona](https://educationforwardarizona.org/school-vouchers-explained/) and other states have tried restricting families’ prepaid debit cards so they can only be used with certain vendors or on particular products. (This is akin to health savings account cards that only work at pharmacies or similar establishments.) These limits help prevent parents from spending ESA money on non-educational expenses, which might otherwise remain undetected for months.

Yet this version, too, has shortcomings. Parents may find the list of vendors too restrictive, ESA offices may struggle to keep the provider list up-to-date, and vendors may inflate their prices knowing that families are limited in the sellers from which they can choose.

Online marketplaces

The most popular method to promote accountability in ESA programs is maintaining Amazon-style platforms to connect parents with vendors. Approved providers can list their goods and services on these online marketplaces, and families can peruse and purchase the products of their choice. Typically, these platforms are developed and managed by third parties, like [ClassWallet](https://classwallet.com/n-h-s-education-freedom-accounts-program-partners-with-national-firm-to-administer-money/) in New Hampshire or [MyScholarShop](https://www.stepupforstudents.org/scholarships/myscholarshop/) in Florida.

This approach offers distinct benefits. It eliminates the need for state staff to manually review receipts, and because parents can leave reviews of the products they have purchased, these platforms offer another layer of transparency for families.

**But what about results?**

These measures help to prevent waste and fraud, but they don’t really get to the heart of the matter: holding providers accountable for improving student learning and other important outcomes_._ So far, unfortunately, it appears that this form of accountability may simply be out of reach for à la carte services.

That’s because of what we might call the “à la carte accountability conundrum.” It is all but impossible to measure the true effectiveness of products from ESA vendors (again, save for private schools) because of the varied and fragmented nature of these offerings. With every child using a unique set of tools, it’s extraordinarily difficult to determine which specific services directly impact students’ academic performance—and how effective they are. Variations in the quality, duration, and frequency of these services make attributing academic gains to any single factor even harder. As a result, trying to draw clear connections between specific ESA purchases and measurable outcomes like test scores feels like an exercise in futility.

We learned this lesson two decades ago, when the federal government’s No Child Left Behind Act included a [Supplemental Educational Services](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/case-studies-supplemental-services-under-no-child-left-behind-act-findings-2003) initiative, affording parents voucher-style choices among tutoring programs. Though that program was limited to tutoring in reading and math, [evaluators](https://fordhaminstitute.org/ohio/commentary/tightening-title-i-implementation-and-effectiveness-supplemental-education-services) [struggled](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20124053/) to identify the impact of a few dozen hours of instruction from different vendors on students’ test scores. Now expand that problem to the ever-growing universe of expenses funded by ESAs, and results-based accountability becomes even tougher to gauge and harder to do anything about.

Is there a solution? Today, probably not. But there might be alternatives. One option is to consider offering low-income and working-class families [enrichment savings accounts](https://www.the74million.org/article/petrilli-when-only-some-kids-can-afford-summer-camp-why-we-must-close-the-enrichment-gap/#:~:text=My%20own%20preference%20is%20to,Girl%20Scouts%2C%20swim%20team%2C%20and) instead of education savings accounts. These funds would not be designed to replace schools but to supplement them—helping children take part in sports, the arts, summer camps, and more. Such a program wouldn’t be paid for from existing education budgets but could be a brand-new expense, perhaps funded at the federal level. These accounts might be kept small, maybe $500 or $1,000 per child. There would be no expectation that the funds would boost academic learning because their purpose would be to close the “enrichment gap,” not address core educational challenges. All low-income and working-class families would be eligible to receive this type of ESA, not just those opting out of their public schools.

The idea of à la carte education, supercharged by education savings accounts, has captured the imagination of school choice advocates far and wide. No doubt families (especially those already homeschooling) welcome the “free money,” and elected officials are happy to reap the electoral rewards. But as a sustainable strategy to promote choice and innovation, publicly funded “unbundled learning” is hard to justify. Especially if we’re talking about large ESAs, directing tens of thousands of dollars a year to families with two or three children, taxpayers will sooner or later demand to know what they are getting for the investment. The answer will inevitably be “we don’t know.” That’s just not good enough.
