# OpenEd Weekly - January 31, 2026

## OPENING LETTER

Happy Friday!

This Sunday is Groundhog Day, which got me thinking: what would you stop doing if you could see your homeschool shadow?

In this edition, we've got a Reddit thread where dozens of parents share the things they *eliminated* that actually made everything better.

The philosophers have a word for this: *via negativa* - the art of what NOT to do. In this week's podcast, Joshua Fields Millburn of The Minimalists calls it the "apophatic approach." Remove what's not working until all that's left is what's right for your child. Joshua is behind three bestselling books, a Netflix documentary, and a wildly successful podcast. Stick around to the end to learn what he means when he says "there are no shoulds in education" – it might relieve some of the stress around decisions about curriculum and extracurricular activities.

We've also got a deep dive into project-based learning (a treehouse story that's been stuck in my head all week), and the surprising research on what reading aloud actually does for kids.

Now let's dive in.

## DEEP DIVE: Project-Based Learning Actually Works

"The experiment took 25 seconds. The writeup took 30 minutes. And that's when my interest in science was totally destroyed."

Jack Casdorph remembers the day clearly. His class magnetized a needle, floated it on a foam packing peanut, and watched it swing north. They were making a homemade compass - the kind of thing that should spark wonder.

Instead, the teacher handed out worksheets.

Years later, Jack's father refused to build him a treehouse. Not because he couldn't - because he wanted Jack to build it himself. What followed took months: climbing lessons, drilling practice, design planning, construction. By the end, Jack understood carpentry, basic engineering, planning, and persistence - none of which appeared on a worksheet. The treehouse still stands twenty years later.

That experience shaped Jack's entire approach to education. He now runs Clean Your Craft, building hands-on STEM kits that teach science through action. His favorite version of the scientific method comes from Sesame Street: "I wonder, what if, let's try."

The research backs him up. Mark Rober's viral experiment with 50,000 people found that removing penalties for failure made participants try 2.5x more often - and succeed 68% of the time vs. 27%. He calls it the "Super Mario Effect."

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: Joshua Fields Millburn - A Minimalist's Guide to Education

Joshua Fields Millburn spent decades helping millions of people declutter their lives. Then his daughter started coming home from school with stomach aches every morning.

Ella was in first grade at a Spanish immersion school in Montana - athletic, easygoing, social. By most measures, a good school. But something was off. Whenever she was told to sit down and focus, to try to read, it fell apart.

Then came the dyslexia tests. Ella took them. And Joshua - about 40 years old at the time - took them alongside her.

"I didn't realize until I had a daughter that I was dyslexic. I mean, she was struggling to read. I'm like, well, yeah, reading is just really hard, right? And they're like, no."

For four decades, he'd walked through the world assuming his struggle with words was universal. Not knowing had given him something, though - a strange superpower with writing, piecing words together precisely because they didn't come easy.

The family found an unschool in Southern California. A husband and wife had bought an old school building and removed all the desks. Joshua describes it as "Lord of the Flies, but with a couple adults on the island." Ella, now 12, has been there for five years. She's making films - because she wanted to try it.

The stomach aches are gone.

When Isaac asked how parents should combat the fear that their kid *should* be learning to code, *should* be doing more - Joshua's answer was simple:

"There are no shoulds, there are only coulds. She can do any of those things. The question is, is she compelled by any of them?"

## ED'S STABLE: "Should My Kid Learn to Code?" Wrong Question.

This week we're featuring a clip that captures the minimalist philosophy in six minutes.

Joshua Fields Millburn breaks down why the question "should my kid learn X?" is fundamentally broken:

*"Should my daughter be enrolled in a sport? Should she learn karate? Should she dance? Should she take calculus? No, there are no shoulds with respect to education. There are only coulds."*

The real question isn't what your child should learn. It's what compels them. When you find that, time behaves differently. In a boring classroom, every minute drags. When you're immersed in something you care about, two hours disappear.
