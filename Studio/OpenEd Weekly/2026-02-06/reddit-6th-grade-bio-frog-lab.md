Oh wow. We did the frog lab today and I have to say I have such a huge pile of emotions (outside of the guilt and such around the frog herself).

When we started homeschooling in PreK (was never our plan. We moved to Hawaii last minute and there were years long wait lists so we decided to roll at home for a while) and loved it. We stuck with it and folks always gave us the side eye or the classic "what about when he gets older?"

I feel kind of proud we were able to provide this type of experience in his home environment. I worried that middle and high school would just be so hard to give him academically challenging work. We live super rurally and our local public system is severely underfunded; we *do* have a high school that does summer chemistry for anyone who wants it and I'm hoping we get that soon!

Anyways. I just wanted to share here among folks who get it.

Well done but blech -- I can smell it through the screen. Some scents you never forget x_x

I was still in public school when we did this, I skipped school that day. I'd be pissed if I couldn't skip this because I was homeschooled, lol!

Disgusting. But cool! If we ever get to that point in our homeschool, I hope I'm as brave as you haha. Your post reminded me, in highschool I dissected a sheep's eyeball. It still had eyelashes.

Frog dissection in elementary school was the reason I entered the veterinary profession. It unlocked my passion for biology. Congrats on making it through! I would have a hard time not taking over if I did it with my kids!

We were in a shop the other day (I think the big toy shop) and they had synthetic dissection kits! I think we would use that if we do dissection, I did do a frog dissection at school but couldn't handle it now.

Where did you get the frog? Was it an online purchase? Planning for next year!

Dissections were the one part of science that I absolutely hated. The smell, the dead eyes, ugh. I am happy to teach almost anything, even if I have to put in a lot of legwork to prep to do it well. But dissections are firmly on my NOPE list. I will pay whatever I need to pay in order to outsource it, lol. So well done! You are braver than I am and you did an awesome thing.
