## Summary
Julie Bogart addresses the common struggle homeschooling families face when they can't find a community where they truly belong. She argues that many homeschooling communities enforce strict philosophical or ideological standards that exclude families who deviate, and positions Brave Writer as an inclusive alternative that welcomes diverse perspectives.

## Key Points
- Contemporary homeschooling communities often maintain strict philosophical or ideological standards that can exclude families
- When families deviate from community expectations, they may face exclusion or feel uncomfortable participating
- Bogart draws from personal experience of being told she doesn't belong because of changing her mind or disagreeing
- Diverse perspectives strengthen learning: "We grow and we learn when we are exposed to a wide range of ideas and people and beliefs"
- Brave Writer was established with inclusivity as a core principle
- The post functions as both encouragement for isolated homeschoolers and a soft invitation to the Brave Learner Home community

Sometimes it feels hard to be a homeschooler. You're looking for the group where you fit in and you can't quite find one.

Contemporary homeschooling communities often maintain strict philosophical or ideological standards. When families deviate from these expectations, they may face exclusion or feel uncomfortable participating fully.

Bogart reflects from personal experience: "I've lived a version of that experience and it's not fun. It doesn't feel good to be told that you don't belong just because you don't agree or you changed your mind."

When establishing Brave Writer, Bogart prioritized inclusivity. She emphasizes that diverse perspectives strengthen learning: "We grow and we learn when we are exposed to a wide range of ideas and people and beliefs."

The article concludes with an inclusive message: "If it feels like you don't fit elsewhere, just know that you have a home with us. We see you. We want you."

The post encourages readers to join the Brave Learner Home community for additional support, resources, and connections.
