# OpenEd Weekly - February 6, 2026

---

## OPENING LETTER

Happy Friday!

This was the week John Taylor Gatto came back to life in our newsletter - and a 16-year-old filmmaker proved his point in real time.

Gatto won Teacher of the Year three times, then quit in the Wall Street Journal because he couldn't stop noticing what the system was actually teaching kids. Thirty years later, Mason Ember - who dropped out of preschool at four because he didn't want to leave his painting - is making a feature-length documentary about homeschoolers and getting published in the New York Times.

In between, we had Michael Horn take two Harvard courses on the same platform and watch one of them completely fail. Not because the tech broke. Because the design was lazy.

The thread that connects all of this week: someone was paying attention to the kid in front of them - or they weren't.

Here's the full week.

## DEEP DIVE: John Taylor Gatto Quit at the Peak - Here's Why It Matters Now

In 1991, months after being named New York State Teacher of the Year, John Taylor Gatto did something nobody expected. He published an op-ed in the *Wall Street Journal* announcing he was done: "I can't teach this way any longer. If you hear of a job where I don't have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know."

After 30 years in New York City public schools, Gatto had identified what he called the "hidden curriculum" - seven lessons that all institutional schools inevitably teach, regardless of what's written on the whiteboard. Confusion. Class position. Indifference. Emotional dependency. And three more that cut even deeper.

"Schooling is a form of adoption," he later wrote. "You give your kid away at his most plastic years to a group of strangers."

We published a short profile of Gatto last year that landed on the second page of Google. This week we went back in, rewrote it, and gave it the depth it deserved. Every few months, another wave of stories hits about homeschool kids "falling behind" - but nobody asks: compared to what? Gatto asked that question 30 years ago. The open education movement is his legacy in action.

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: Mason Ember - A 16-Year-Old Responds to the New York Times

Mason Ember is 16 years old. He's been homeschooled his entire life. He's currently making a feature-length documentary called [*Against the Grade*](https://www.againstthegrade.com/), following four teenagers with radically different approaches to education.

When the New York Times published "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right," Mason [wrote a response](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/letters/home-schooling-debate.html) that got published in their letters section. His comparison: finding a restaurant with health code violations and using it to define a city's food scene.

The moment that stuck with me was the book club scene. Ten teenagers sitting in a New York apartment reading *Madame Bovary*. No parents. No teachers. No one telling them to stay on task. One of them organized the whole thing - the books, the food, the museum trips afterward. Sometimes she makes enough dinner for everyone. Sometimes people go home hungry. She figures it out.

After a year of filming four teenagers with wildly different approaches, Mason's conclusion is five words: be pro-kid, not pro-system.

His criticisms of homeschooling are worth hearing too. It works better with money and urban density. And because you choose your community, you can end up in a bubble if you're not careful. The fact that a 16-year-old can name these structural problems - while still advocating for the model - says something about what this kind of education produces.

## TRENDS WE'RE FOLLOWING

[**A Rich DC School Just Dropped Full-Length Books from 8th Grade**](https://www.educationnext.org/readings-thin-line-between-difficult-and-boring/) - The richest public middle school in DC told parents their 8th graders won't read complete novels anymore. Short passages "better prepare them for high school." The author argues the real problem: we've confused difficult with boring, and are training kids to never wrestle with anything longer than a page. (Education Next)

[**Homeschoolers Outperform on Nearly Every Measure - But Why?**](https://nheri.org/homeschoolers-versus-conventional-students/) - NHERI's latest research roundup compares homeschooled and conventionally-schooled students across mental health, academics, and social skills. The headline stats are predictable (higher ACT, lower depression). The interesting detail: homeschooled kids get significantly more sleep. Maybe the pedagogy debate is a distraction and we should just let teenagers sleep. (NHERI)

[**Alpha School Students Finish Academics in 2 Hours**](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/the-ai-behind-alpha-school) - Michael Horn goes deep on how Alpha School uses AI-powered dashboards and personalized learning apps so students complete their core academics by 10am. The rest of the day goes to real-world projects. This is the "design over delivery" point from Wednesday's newsletter taken to its logical extreme. (Michael Horn)

[**A Neuroscientist Accidentally Made the Case for Homeschooling**](https://www.educationnext.org/science-of-memory-goes-to-school-ramirez-how-to-change-a-memory/) - BU's Steve Ramirez published a book on how memory is fluid and shaped by emotion. He wasn't writing about education. But the implication is hard to miss: a kid who associates learning with anxiety is literally wiring that in. (Education Next)

[**872 Homeschool Parents Had the Fight School Boards Can't**](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1qtx92e/rant_you_dont_homeschool_enough/) - "You don't homeschool enough." One parent ranting about co-op families who barely do 30 minutes a day. The replies are the real story - PreK parents saying 10 minutes is fine, others calling out families whose high schoolers can't read. Self-governance is messy. It's also working. (r/homeschool)

## TOOLS WE'RE BOOKMARKING

[**How to Teach Your Kid Creative Writing**](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-202-how-to-teach-your) - A Stanford freshman from Alpha School breaks down their approach to teaching creative writing: mechanical skills first, then application through real projects. Includes "Creative Insults Only" day - you can only complain using metaphors. "That math homework is a black hole sucking away my will to live." Seven exercises you can start this weekend. (Austin Scholar)

[**Living Books About the Middle Ages**](https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/middle-ages-living-books-for-family/) - A curated list of books that make medieval history come alive for the whole family - David Macaulay's *Castle* and *Cathedral*, plus lesser-known picks from the "Pageant of History" curriculum. If you're doing Charlotte Mason or just want history that doesn't read like a textbook. (Simply Charlotte Mason)

[**The Justification For Latin**](https://www.memoriapress.com/articles/justification-for-latin/) - Memoria Press makes the classic case: Latin's primary value isn't speaking a dead language. It's training English mastery through rigorous translation work. The discipline of parsing Latin sentences develops the kind of precise thinking that shows up everywhere else. (Memoria Press)

[**One More Really Big Reason to Read Stories to Children**](https://petergray.substack.com/p/102-audio-one-more-really-big-reason) - Peter Gray on reading aloud - what it does for kids beyond the obvious, and why it's not something a screen can replicate. (Play Makes Us Human)

[**Navigating School Choice Funding**](https://homeschoolboss.com/2026/02/navigating-school-choice-funding-your-homeschool-journey/) - Explainer on three types of programs that can offset homeschool costs: Education Savings Accounts, tax credits, and vouchers. Varies by state, but worth knowing what's available where you are. (Homeschool Boss)

[**Considering Online Homeschool Options with Live Classes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1qq1yxd/considering_online_homeschool_options_with_live/) - Parents share real experiences with Legacy School, Ignite Learning Academy, and other providers that balance structure with flexibility. Useful thread if you're looking for something between full DIY and full enrollment. (r/homeschool)

## ED'S STABLE: "Be Pro-Kid, Not Pro-System"

This week's through-line showed up everywhere.

Gatto said it in the Wall Street Journal: the system teaches confusion, class position, and indifference - regardless of what's on the lesson plan. Horn showed it on Harvard's platform: same technology, opposite outcomes, because one course cared about design and the other didn't. And Mason Ember, at 16, landed on the same conclusion from the other direction: stop arguing about systems and start paying attention to the kid in front of you.

Monday's newsletter showed what happens when the data says one thing and the headlines say another. Wednesday's showed what happens when two courses use the same technology and produce opposite results. Thursday traced those questions back to the teacher who first asked them three decades ago. And today, a teenager proved the answer hasn't changed.

The question was never "which system is best." It was always "is someone paying attention?"
