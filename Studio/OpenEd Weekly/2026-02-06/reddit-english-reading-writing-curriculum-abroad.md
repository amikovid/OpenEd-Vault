## Summary
A parent living in Japan with kids (ages 12 and 9) attending Japanese public school is looking for an English reading/writing curriculum to supplement at home. The children are strong readers but falling behind in writing skills -- both the physical act of writing and the thinking/organizing aspects of expressing ideas in written English.

## Key Points
- Family moved from the U.S. to Japan; kids attend public school in Japanese
- Children read and speak English at home but are falling behind in writing
- Looking for a workbook-style resource combining reading, writing in response to reading, paragraph/story writing, and critical thinking/analysis
- Community recommendations: Hearth and Story novel studies, Lightning Literature, Winning with Writing, Writing with Skill (Well-Trained Mind)

Hi! Hope it's ok to post here as someone who doesn't technically homeschool -- we moved out of our home country, the U.S., a few years ago. My kids (age 12 and 9) now attend public school in Japan and speak Japanese at school.

They read quite a bit in English at home, and we speak English at home too, but I'm concerned they're falling behind in writing skills -- both the physical act of writing English (especially my 9 year old) and the thinking/organizing aspects of clearly expressing something in written English. I want to find some kind of resource that we could use at home for English.

Ideally I would love to find a workbook or something along those lines that incorporates reading, writing in response to reading, writing paragraphs/stories/etc, and ideally some kind of critical thinking/analysis aspect as well... I don't know if something like this exists, but please let me know if you have any suggestions! They are both strong readers for their ages but probably a bit behind in writing at this point.

Hearth and Story has novel studies which could work. Just novel studies in general could be good. Lightning Literature (it has a lot of grammar work too I think) -- it's big and you likely have to source lots of books. Winning with Writing is very straight forward and open and go. Not sure how much reading comprehension it would have though. Great for step by step writing instruction. Writing with Skill from the Well-Trained Mind could be good actually. It combines reading comp and writing. I'd use YouTube to look at all of these. Sometimes their publisher will have samples available too.
