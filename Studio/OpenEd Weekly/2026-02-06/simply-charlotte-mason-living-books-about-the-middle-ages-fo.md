We’re so excited about our new history curriculum, [A Pageant of History](https://simplycharlottemason.com/store/charlotte-mason-history-curriculum/), and all of the wonderful books that your children will get to read as they work their way through the different time periods. Today I want to share with you our favorite books that they can enjoy as a whole family while studying the Middle Ages.
A Pageant of History is a 4-year history curriculum designed to give your students the joy of [living books](https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/what-a-living-book-sounds-like/). Living history books are different from textbooks. They don’t give you a dry fact dump; rather, they tell the stories of people who lived in a different time than we do. Those stories make that time period “come alive” to your students.
Living Books to Read Together
The Middle Ages are chock full of interesting stories from around the world, and from that collection, we have selected our favorites and given your students a full school year to enjoy them. I’ll cover the Family books in this post, and then share the additional books for various age groups in the following posts.
Let me explain what I mean by “Family books” first. Our curriculum is designed to teach your whole family together, with all of your students studying the same time period. We schedule certain books for you to read all together as a family and other books for the different age groups to enjoy on their own. But all of the books are centered in the selected time period; in this case, the Middle Ages.
You’ll be reading three books together as a family during your study of the Middle Ages.
A Castle with Many Rooms by Lorene Lambert
The first is [A Castle with Many Rooms: The Story of the Middle Ages](https://simplycharlottemason.com/store/castle-many-rooms/) by Lorene Lambert. This is a fabulous living book that tells the stories of people living in Europe, the Middle East, America, Asia, and Africa. Your students will peek into the lives of kings, monks, vikings, the Maya, the samurai, the Mongols, explorers, freedom fighters, and more.
This book will serve as the spine of your study. It will present a chronological stream of events and people, giving your study the structure that it needs. Then you can branch off of that spine and delve more deeply into different people and events as you go along. We’ve chosen two books like that for your family to enjoy together: Castle and Cathedral, both by David Macaulay. Both of these books have been recently updated and revised with color illustrations and are better than ever.
Castle by David Macaulay
In Castle, you get to follow the building of a castle in Wales—from choosing the site to making the plan to gathering the workers to constructing the building and walls, along with the town around it. Your student will learn about the defense strategies built into the structure and watch as those strategies are put to the test in an attack.
Cathedral by David Macaulay
Cathedral reveals the story of how one of those magnificent buildings was designed and constructed over 90 years, to finally be used by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the men who laid the foundations. And tucked into both of these stories is the fascinating explanation of how they were built—told in a living way. As the author states in his preface, “It has always been my goal to draw my readers into the process, to make them feel like participants in the creation of these structures rather than merely curious but faraway bystanders.”
Options for Grades 1–2
Now, because these books are scheduled for the whole family to read together, all the way up through high schoolers, you may find that some of them might be a bit much for your youngest students, those in grades 1 and maybe 2. That’s not a problem. You’ll find in our curriculum that we offer a couple of options for that situation. Option #1: You can set aside the Family books and just read with those youngest students the books selected for grades 1–4. (I’ll cover those next time, so stay tuned; and we’ll add a link once that post is released.) There’s no problem with skipping the Family books this time around, because, since this is a four-year cycle, your students will study this time period a total of three times during their educational years. So you can easily save the Family books for when your students are in the middle-school and high-school years, along with the other books that are scheduled for those grades. Or Option #2: you could do a mixture with your youngest students, reading some of the Family books’ chapters, perhaps at a slower pace, as well as the books selected for grades 1–4. You choose what will work best for you.
By the way, I think you’ll be happy to know that our curriculum now includes specific narration prompts for all of these books. They’re written right into the lessons, so you’ll have everything you need to enjoy these great books and encourage your students to tell what they’ve learned.
No matter when you decide to share these books with your students, you can be sure that they will make the Middle Ages come alive in their imaginations. And there are many more wonderful books that we have selected for this study. Tune in next time to hear about our favorites for grades 1–4.
