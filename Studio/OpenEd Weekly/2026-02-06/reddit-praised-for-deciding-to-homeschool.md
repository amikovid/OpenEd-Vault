Just pulled my 8 yr old out of public school. She's super smart but struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks. After some discussion with her, my husband and I decided home school was the way to go. Why force her to spend months panicking over a standardized test that isn't even necessary? Anyway, we talked to her therapist yesterday and told her about our decision to homeschool. I was REALLY expecting to met with negative feedback about it but to my pleasant surprise she was 100% on board! She said that she thought it was an amazing choice for my kiddo and would help her SO MUCH with her anxiety and panic attacks! What a weight off this mommas shoulders to have one less thing to stress about! Just wanted to share that not everyone I've come across is anti-homeschool!

Often when I am out with my kids we are stopped by kind elderly women who just like to say hi. When I tell them we homeschool, they beam with excitement and tell me how much they admire our choice. It's my favorite!

I've been shocked by the number of people who think homeschooling is a great idea. The most shocking is when they're people in the education system congratulating me on my choice.

We get that reaction a lot. People are usually happy to hear that I homeschool. I live somewhere with notoriously bad schools, so maybe that's why. But I remember even before my kids were school aged, people would ask me if I was going to homeschool them.

Homeschooling (if done right) is a great choice.

My son is also 8, and also suffering from severe anxiety and panic attacks! It has been torture. I'm seriously considering homeschool, but I fear all the pushback we'd get from people who just don't understand.

I did the same when my oldest was 8 with the same symptoms. We struggled to make it through 2nd grade but homeschooled after that. I'm so grateful we did, my husband was worried it might just give her a crutch, but she hasn't had anywhere near as much anxiety as before. She's showed anxious moments before things she doesn't know what to expect with, like an all day volleyball camp she's never done before, but pushed through and did great. It's like homeschooling solved the problem and she started to trust that her parents won't put her in unsafe situations anymore.

Homeschooling has become much more common and well-received by parents and experts these past few years and to a lesser extent, the past handful of decades.
