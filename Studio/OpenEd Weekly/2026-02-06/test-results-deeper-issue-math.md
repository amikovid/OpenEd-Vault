## Summary
American students' math struggles are not primarily caused by the pandemic or technology overreliance, but by foundational gaps in understanding that accumulate over time. The article argues that effective math instruction requires balancing procedural knowledge with conceptual understanding, and that standardized testing pressure often drives schools toward the wrong side of that balance.

## Key Points
- Difficulties with advanced math topics (like algebra) often stem from unresolved earlier gaps in fractions or number sense -- math is cumulative
- The core instructional imbalance: traditional curricula prioritize rote memorization and step-following over conceptual understanding
- Example: students memorize the triangle area formula without understanding that a triangle's area equals half a rectangle's area
- Standardized testing pressure drives "teaching to the test," emphasizing procedural accuracy for multiple-choice answers rather than deeper comprehension
- NAEP score declines intensify this pressure, creating a vicious cycle
- Solutions: intentional integration of conceptual knowledge, professional development, diagnostic assessments identifying misconceptions
- Diagnostic tools produced 2-4 months of additional learning gains annually across 3,000 students
- Core message: procedures alone are insufficient; true mathematical learning requires applying knowledge to novel problems

## Full Content

American students struggle with mathematics, and while some blame the pandemic or technology overreliance, research reveals a different culprit: foundational gaps in understanding that accumulate over time.

### The Root Problem

According to the author's research, "difficulties with advanced topics often stem from earlier gaps in understanding." Since math is cumulative, students struggling with algebra may face unresolved challenges with fractions or number sense from earlier grades. These deficiencies persist and compound.

### Conceptual vs. Procedural Knowledge

The central issue centers on instructional balance. "Effective math learning requires both" understanding procedures and knowing why they work. Many traditional curricula prioritize rote memorization and step-following over conceptual understanding, creating a disconnect that becomes problematic in later grades.

For instance, students might memorize the triangle area formula without understanding that a triangle's area equals half a rectangle's area -- a visual, conceptual insight that builds reasoning skills.

### Contributing Factors

Standardized testing pressure drives this imbalance. Schools focused on test score metrics often encourage teachers to "teach to the test," emphasizing procedural accuracy for multiple-choice answers rather than deeper comprehension. NAEP score declines intensify this pressure.

### Solutions

The author proposes intentional integration of conceptual knowledge through professional development, diagnostic assessments identifying misconceptions, and tools analyzing student work. Research shows diagnostic tools produced "two to four months of additional learning gains" annually across 3,000 students.

Procedures alone prove insufficient. True mathematical learning requires applying knowledge to novel problems.
