## Summary
A blog post arguing that homeschooling "success stories" fall into three flawed categories: distorted realities masking underlying problems, narcissistic parental dynamics where children become indoctrinated advocates, and mediocre outcomes indistinguishable from public school graduates. The author examines several people she personally knows to build the case that even non-abusive homeschooling environments fail to provide the age-appropriate independence children need.

## Key Points
- Homeschooling success narratives are categorized as: distorted realities, narcissistic parental dynamics, or mediocre outcomes
- Six case studies from the author's personal life illustrate different failure modes
- Even "loving, non-abusive" homeschooling environments are argued to deprive children of developmental independence needed starting around age 4-5
- "Lack of badness does not equal goodness" - the absence of abuse doesn't mean the approach is beneficial
- The best-case homeschooling outcomes produce adults "indistinguishable from public school graduates," which ironically undermines the case for homeschooling
- The author's position is strongly anti-homeschooling: "if homeschooling became illegal tomorrow, that would literally save lives"

**Author:** A. | **Published:** June 15, 2024 (Updated September 7, 2024)

### Core Thesis
The author contends that homeschooling success narratives are misleading and fall into three flawed categories. She argues that even positive homeschooling experiences represent missed developmental opportunities rather than genuine educational benefits.

### Case Studies

**Ginny** (author's sister): Received minimal math instruction, struggled with basic cashier skills, and married her first boyfriend due to limited social exposure - circumstances the author attributes to homeschooling isolation.

**Adam** (brother-in-law): Homeschooled K-12 by indulgent parents who encouraged superiority beliefs. As an adult, he exhibits antisocial behaviors including harassment and fraud, which the author suggests might have been prevented through objective peer feedback in traditional school.

**Amanda** (sister-in-law): "Unschooled" student who became limited to humanities study and now operates as a reclusive housewife, perpetuating the educational model with her own children.

**Peter:** A mathematically gifted student who "hated being homeschooled" despite professional success, suggesting parental pressure rather than genuine benefit.

**Katie:** Thrived once enrolled in public school, declaring she was glad to escape homeschooling despite having a supportive, non-abusive homeschool experience.

**The Parkinson Sisters:** Described as "indistinguishable from public school graduates" - the closest to success stories, yet this invisibility ironically undermines homeschooling's necessity.

### Key Arguments
The author asserts that children require age-appropriate independence from parents beginning around age four or five. Even loving, non-abusive homeschooling environments cannot satisfy this developmental need. She emphasizes that "lack of badness does not equal goodness" and that the best homeschooling outcomes merely produce unremarkable adults.

### Conclusion
The author categorizes success stories as either exaggerated accounts masking underlying problems, products of narcissistic parenting (where children became indoctrinated advocates), or entirely mediocre results. She questions why an educational approach whose optimal outcome is indistinguishability from public school education should remain legal.

**Original post text:**
"This is an interesting article I found about how even people who say they liked being homeschooled, or outwardly appear successful, can still have been harmed by homeschooling. It is just the author's anecdotal observations, but it does show that success is more complex than academic achievement or kids being content with homeschooling."

I am technically a "success story", at least career wise. Personal life is a mess though. I am a tenured professor in my field and am doing fine financially. Trauma catches up to you though, and the abuse I went through is still something I am dealing with today.

**u/lyfeTry (score: 49):**
I've posted a lot here. I am super high educated. I have a masters and a doctorate. I'm used as a "success" story from my parents. I did all this in SPITE of homeschooling. I still have imposter syndrome. But I've learned to tell myself, "I actually know more than ANYONE in this room." I had to take remedial math in community college. I barely knew basic math. I ended up taking Calculus and all the physics for my degree due to those nice people in those labs who tutored me. I worked my ass off to be different than them, and I will not homeschool my own children.

I would have considered myself a success story. I liked being homeschooled. My mom actually had her teaching license, and academically I was blessed by that. But I also developed a lot of anxiety around people, have questionable social skills, and have trouble interacting with people in normal ways. I am far too reliant on my parents and probably always will be. I thought I was lucky for a while because in person school would have been hard for me, but now I think facing that difficulty earlier and getting supports into place for my disability would have been better.

I'm a success story. I have a PhD in a sexy subject, and a stable job. My parents choose to forget that I'm queer, and tolerate my presumed atheism. I have a panic disorder, major depression, and significant mental health issues related to the feelings that I only deserve love if I'm easy and small and don't take up too much space. I carry my scars with me.

I'd be considered a homeschool success story. I went to college, got a BA and 4.0, have a successful career where I'm well respected. And all of those things are *in spite of* homeschooling, not because of it. I didn't get more than a 6th grade education. I had to fight tooth and nail to educate myself, get my GED, and get a job. I succeeded due to rage, spite, and determination.

At 15, I tested at 5th grade levels across all core subjects when I tried to take community college classes. I spent the next year studying feverishly at the library, often for 10-12 hours a day. My parents to this day brag to everyone about how they were excellent educators. My mom even has 'educator' and a list of all my degrees and academic achievements on her LinkedIn. One of my published articles is about homeschooling as a vehicle of abuse and how self-reporting warps statistics.

I said I liked being homeschooled for years... until I got into therapy lol.
