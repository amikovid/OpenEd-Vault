# OpenEd Weekly - February 6, 2026

---

## OPENING LETTER

Happy Friday!

Yesterday we published a long profile of John Taylor Gatto - the three-time Teacher of the Year who quit in the Wall Street Journal because he couldn't stop noticing what the system was actually teaching kids. That piece has already become one of our most-read articles.

But the conversation I keep thinking about this week happened the day before, when we sat down with Mason Ember.

Mason is 16 years old, homeschooled his entire life, and currently making a feature-length documentary called *Against the Grade*. When the New York Times published "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right," he wrote a response and got it published in their letters section. We released the full interview yesterday and it didn't go out on its own - so today I'm giving it the stage it deserves.

Gatto said the quiet part out loud in 1991. Thirty years later, a teenager is saying it on camera. And in between, a Reddit thread full of PhDs who succeeded "in spite of" homeschooling reminded us that no model - not school, not homeschool - works when nobody's paying attention to the kid.

That's the thread this week. Here's the full edition.

## FEATURED PODCAST: Mason Ember - A 16-Year-Old Filmmaker Spent a Year Documenting Homeschoolers

Most of what we share about open education and homeschooling is written by parents, teachers, researchers, and policy people. Today we get to hear from someone who's actually living it right now.

Mason Ember dropped out of preschool at four. He was at the Blue School in Manhattan - founded by a member of the Blue Man Group, arts-focused, as progressive as it gets. It should have been a perfect fit. It lasted two months. The way he tells it: he was at an art easel, finger painting, totally absorbed. A teacher told him it was time for group sing-along. He argued with her. He was four.

His parents pulled him out and tried homeschooling as an experiment. Year by year, they checked in. Is he learning what he needs? Is this still working? Every year, the answer was yes.

What followed was a childhood that looks incoherent from the outside and makes total sense from the inside. Mason wanted to be a stage magician. Then a chef. Then a comedian. Then a pilot. Then a filmmaker. His parents let him chase each one. His mom told him later: "I didn't really want you to become a stage magician." But she let him explore it for a year anyway.

His parents did something subtle. They didn't see "film" as his through-line. They saw *storytelling*. Whether he was making cooking shows in the basement at eight, writing jokes for a comedy show he produced, or creating a feature-length documentary at sixteen, the skill beneath the skill stayed consistent.

The moment that stuck with me was the book club scene. Ten teenagers sitting in a New York apartment reading *Madame Bovary*. No parents. No teachers. No one telling them to stay on task. One of them organized the whole thing - the books, the food, the museum trips afterward. Sometimes she makes enough dinner for everyone. Sometimes people go home hungry. She figures it out.

After a year of filming four teenagers with wildly different approaches, Mason's conclusion is five words: be pro-kid, not pro-system.

His criticisms of homeschooling are worth hearing too. It works better with money and urban density. And because you choose your community, you can end up in a bubble if you're not careful. The fact that a 16-year-old can name these structural problems - while still advocating for the model - says something about what this kind of education produces.

## DEEP DIVE: John Taylor Gatto Quit at the Peak - Here's Why It Matters Now

In 1991, months after being named New York State Teacher of the Year, John Taylor Gatto did something nobody expected. He published an op-ed in the *Wall Street Journal* announcing he was done: "I can't teach this way any longer. If you hear of a job where I don't have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know."

After 30 years in New York City public schools, Gatto had identified what he called the "hidden curriculum" - seven lessons that all institutional schools inevitably teach, regardless of what's written on the whiteboard. Confusion. Class position. Indifference. Emotional dependency. And three more that cut even deeper.

"Schooling is a form of adoption," he later wrote. "You give your kid away at his most plastic years to a group of strangers."

We published a short profile of Gatto last year that landed on the second page of Google. This week we went back in, rewrote it, and gave it the depth it deserved. Every few months, another wave of stories hits about homeschool kids "falling behind" - but nobody asks: compared to what? Gatto asked that question 30 years ago. The open education movement is his legacy in action.

## TRENDS WE'RE FOLLOWING

[**A Rich DC School Just Dropped Full-Length Books from 8th Grade**](https://www.educationnext.org/readings-thin-line-between-difficult-and-boring/) - The richest public middle school in DC told parents their 8th graders won't read complete novels anymore. Short passages "better prepare them for high school." The author argues the real problem: we've confused difficult with boring, and are training kids to never wrestle with anything longer than a page. (Education Next)

[**Test Results Reveal a Deeper Issue in Math**](https://www.the74million.org/article/test-results-reveal-a-deeper-issue-in-math-and-its-not-the-math-itself/) - American students' math struggles trace back to foundational gaps that compound year after year. Curricula that prioritize memorizing formulas over understanding why they work create a disconnect that grows with every grade level. A student who memorizes the triangle area formula without understanding it's half a rectangle isn't learning math - they're learning compliance. Diagnostic tools that catch these gaps early produced 2-4 months of additional learning gains across 3,000 students. (The 74)

[**1,100 High Schoolers Just Got Corporate Internships**](https://www.the74million.org/article/national-internship-program-grows-placing-high-schoolers-in-rare-corporate-jobs/) - Genesys Works places high school students at companies like Target, Accenture, 3M, and Medtronic - 15-20 hours a week at $14-18/hour in IT, marketing, and HR roles. The nonprofit handles all the administrative friction (payroll, insurance, mentorship) that stops companies from hiring teenagers. Students complete an 8-week summer training first. Employers report zero behavior issues and high motivation. One student went from doubting whether anyone would like her to being "stunned" by her own contributions. Operating in 8 metro areas now. (The 74)

[**Alpha School Students Finish Academics in 2 Hours**](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/the-ai-behind-alpha-school) - Michael Horn goes deep on how Alpha School uses AI-powered dashboards and personalized learning apps so students complete their core academics by 10am. The rest of the day goes to real-world projects. This is the "design over delivery" point from Wednesday's newsletter taken to its logical extreme. (Michael Horn)

[**The CHOICE Framework for Education in the AI Era**](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2026/02/05/the-choice-we-make-the-critically-human-skills-that-define-our-future/) - Getting Smart presents a fork in the road: a "Passive Culture" where humans cede thinking to algorithms, or a "Purpose Culture" where AI amplifies what's distinctly human. Their framework - Critical Thinking, Healthy Living, Originality, Inquiry, Connection, Emotional Intelligence - maps six competencies that AI can't replace. The investment imbalance is stark: AI spending dwarfs investment in the human skills required to coexist with it. (Getting Smart)

## TOOLS WE'RE BOOKMARKING

[**Performance Anxiety and Assessments: What Homeschool Parents Need to Know**](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/performance-anxiety-assessments-and-our-complex-kids/) - If your child can talk about science on a car ride but melts down with a countdown timer, this is the article. Performance anxiety triggers a threat response where the amygdala shuts down working memory. Practical accommodations: two challenging problems instead of thirty, postcards instead of essays, choice boards, oral responses, Lego models for math. The goal is evidence of knowledge, not compliance with formats that don't serve your child. (Raising Lifelong Learners)

[**How to Teach Your Kid Creative Writing**](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-202-how-to-teach-your) - A Stanford freshman from Alpha School breaks down their approach to teaching creative writing: mechanical skills first, then application through real projects. Includes "Creative Insults Only" day - you can only complain using metaphors. "That math homework is a black hole sucking away my will to live." Seven exercises you can start this weekend. (Austin Scholar)

[**Living Books About the Middle Ages**](https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/middle-ages-living-books-for-family/) - A curated list of books that make medieval history come alive for the whole family - David Macaulay's *Castle* and *Cathedral*, plus lesser-known picks from the "Pageant of History" curriculum. If you're doing Charlotte Mason or just want history that doesn't read like a textbook. (Simply Charlotte Mason)

[**The Justification For Latin**](https://www.memoriapress.com/articles/justification-for-latin/) - Memoria Press makes the classic case: Latin trains English mastery through rigorous translation work. The discipline of parsing Latin sentences develops the kind of precise thinking that shows up everywhere else. (Memoria Press)

[**One More Really Big Reason to Read Stories to Children**](https://petergray.substack.com/p/102-audio-one-more-really-big-reason) - Peter Gray on reading aloud - what it does for kids beyond the obvious, and why it's not something a screen can replicate. (Play Makes Us Human)

[**English Curriculum for Bilingual Kids Abroad**](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1qxgc04/looking_for_an_english_readingwriting_curriculum/) - A parent in Japan with kids ages 12 and 9 in Japanese public school needed to shore up English writing at home. The community delivered: Hearth and Story novel studies, Lightning Literature, Writing with Skill from the Well-Trained Mind. Useful thread if you're supplementing English internationally - or if your strong reader is a reluctant writer. (r/homeschool)

## FROM THE COMMUNITY

This week we started scanning Reddit, X, and Hacker News alongside our RSS feeds. Here's what the conversation looked like.

**"If You Don't Fit In"** - Julie Bogart of Brave Writer addresses something a lot of homeschool families feel but don't say out loud: the communities that are supposed to welcome you often maintain strict philosophical or ideological standards that exclude families who deviate. "I've lived a version of that experience. It doesn't feel good to be told that you don't belong just because you don't agree or you changed your mind." [Read more](https://blog.bravewriter.com/2026/02/06/if-you-dont-fit-in/)

**"Are You a Homeschooling Success Story?"** - One of the most striking Reddit threads we've ever read. On r/HomeschoolRecovery, people with PhDs, doctorates, and successful careers describe achieving everything *in spite of* homeschooling - carrying trauma, depression, and social deficits behind outward success. One respondent had to self-teach from 5th grade math at age 15 to eventually reach graduate school. Another's mother lists her child's degrees on LinkedIn as "educator" accomplishments. The common thread: "I said I liked being homeschooled for years... until I got into therapy." It's uncomfortable reading for anyone in the homeschool world. It's also essential. These are the stories of what happens when nobody's paying attention. [Read the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeschoolRecovery/comments/1qsb940/are_you_a_homeschooling_success_story/)

**First Day Homeschooling** - @motherpilled on X shared her first official day homeschooling her almost-5-year-old: morning basket with zebra coloring sheets and the letter Z. 2,200+ likes. The simplicity is the point.

**The Frog Lab** - A homeschool parent on r/homeschool shared the milestone of completing a frog dissection with their 6th grader. They started homeschooling unplanned in PreK after moving to Hawaii (years-long school waitlists). Now they're doing lab science at home in a rural area with a severely underfunded public system. "I feel kind of proud we were able to provide this type of experience." 41 upvotes, 35 comments of encouragement and nostalgia. [Read the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1qw88m8/6th_grade_bio_the_frog_lab/)

**"Praised for Deciding to Homeschool"** - A parent's therapist enthusiastically supported their decision to homeschool their 8-year-old with severe anxiety and panic attacks. The replies from parents who made the same call - and watched the anxiety lift - are worth reading if you're on the fence.

## ED'S STABLE: "Be Pro-Kid, Not Pro-System"

Gatto said it in the Wall Street Journal: the system teaches confusion, class position, and indifference - regardless of what's on the lesson plan. Mason Ember, at 16, landed on the same conclusion from the other direction: stop arguing about systems and start paying attention to the kid in front of you.

And on Reddit this week, a thread full of "homeschool success stories" showed what it looks like when nobody does that. People with doctorates and tenure-track careers, built on rage and spite and determination, carrying trauma from a model that was supposed to set them free. The common denominator was always whether someone was paying attention.

The question was never "which system is best." It was always "is someone paying attention?"
