Happy Friday!

Two things from this week I can't stop thinking about.

First: we sat down with Mason Ember - a 16-year-old filmmaker who's been homeschooled his entire life and just spent a year making a documentary about it. He dropped out of preschool at four because he didn't want to stop painting. Now he's filming book clubs in New York apartments and responding to the New York Times. His five-word thesis: be pro-kid, not pro-system. ([Listen to the full episode](https://opened.co/podcast/mason-ember) | [Read the write-up](https://opened.co/blog/a-16-year-old-filmmaker-spent-a-year-documenting-homeschoolers-heres-what-he-found))

Second: we rewrote our John Taylor Gatto profile from the ground up. Three-time Teacher of the Year. Quit in the Wall Street Journal. Identified seven hidden lessons that every school teaches regardless of what's on the whiteboard. It's already one of our most-read pieces this year. ([Read the deep dive](https://opened.co/blog/5369))

And in between, a Reddit thread full of PhDs who built careers on rage and spite reminded us that no model - not school, not homeschool - works when nobody's paying attention to the kid.

That's the thread this week.

# Mason Ember Dropped Out of Preschool at Four. Here's What He Built Instead.

*By Ela Richmond*

Most of what we share about open education is written by parents, teachers, researchers, and policy people. We constantly ask them what children need. We rarely ask the kids.

Mason Ember is 16. He was at the Blue School in Manhattan - founded by a member of the Blue Man Group, arts-focused, as progressive as it gets. It lasted two months. He was at an art easel, finger painting, totally absorbed. A teacher told him it was time for group sing-along. He argued with her. 

He was four.

Following that incident, his parents pulled him out and tried homeschooling as an experiment. Year by year, they checked in. Is he learning what he needs? Is this still working? Every year, the answer was yes.

What followed was a childhood that looks incoherent from the outside and makes total sense from the inside. Mason wanted to be a stage magician. Then a chef. Then a comedian. Then a pilot. Then a filmmaker. His parents let him chase each one. His mom told him later: "I didn't really want you to become a stage magician." But she let him explore it for a year anyway.

His parents did something subtle. They didn't see "film" as his through-line. They saw *storytelling*. Whether he was making cooking shows in the basement at eight, writing jokes for a comedy show he produced, or creating a feature-length documentary at sixteen, the skill beneath the skill stayed consistent.

The moment that stuck with me was the book club scene. Ten teenagers sitting in a New York apartment reading *Madame Bovary*. No parents. No teachers. No one telling them to stay on task. One of them organized the whole thing - the books, the food, the museum trips afterward. Sometimes she makes enough dinner for everyone. Sometimes people go home hungry. She figures it out.

After a year of filming four teenagers with wildly different approaches, Mason's conclusion is five words: be pro-kid, not pro-system.

But his criticisms of homeschooling are worth hearing too. It works better with money and urban density. And because you choose your community, you can end up in a bubble if you're not careful. The fact that a 16-year-old can name these structural problems - while still advocating for the model - says something about what this kind of education produces.

# John Taylor Gatto Quit at the Peak - Here's Why It Matters Now

In 1991, months after being named New York State Teacher of the Year, John Taylor Gatto published an op-ed in the *Wall Street Journal* announcing he was done: "I can't teach this way any longer. If you hear of a job where I don't have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know."

After 30 years in New York City public schools, Gatto identified what he called the "hidden curriculum" - seven lessons that all institutional schools inevitably teach, regardless of what's on the whiteboard. Confusion. Class position. Indifference. Emotional dependency. And three more that cut even deeper.

"Schooling is a form of adoption," he later wrote. "You give your kid away at his most plastic years to a group of strangers."

We published a short profile of Gatto last year that landed on the second page of Google. This week we went back in, rewrote it, and gave it the depth it deserved.

# Ed's Stable

This week we turned last week's project-based learning deep dive into a visual walkthrough: [**The OpenEd Approach to Project-Based Learning in 7 Steps**](https://www.facebook.com/openedhq/posts/pfbid02vRtoW8agnBw7xEPXcRNMRRCgALPuYBHUQfp67NZCHT4azNbqf9SgfrLHwrAGwCqJl). Seven steps from creating a Discovery Zone to presenting a finished project - designed for families who want to turn their kid's curiosity into something real. Save it, share it, try it this weekend.

Speaking of deep dives - we're planning the next few months of long-form profiles and guides, and we want to hear from you. **What topics do you want us to go deep on next?** A particular thinker? A curriculum philosophy? A question you keep running into? Reply to this email and let us know. We read every response.
