## Summary
Genesys Works, a national nonprofit founded in Houston in 2002, has placed approximately 1,100 high school students in corporate internships across 202 companies this school year. The program removes administrative barriers that discourage employers from hiring teenagers by handling recruiting, payroll, insurance, and mentorship -- making it easy for companies like Target, Accenture, 3M, and Medtronic to bring on young interns.

## Key Points
- Genesys Works operates in 8 metro areas: Chicago, Houston, Jacksonville, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York, San Francisco, Tulsa, and Washington, D.C.
- Students work 15-20 hours weekly at $14-18/hour in IT, marketing, and HR roles
- The nonprofit handles all administrative overhead (recruiting, payroll, insurance, mentor pairing, school coordination) -- companies pay roughly double the student wages for this support
- Before placement, students complete an 8-week summer training covering communication, time management, work ethic, problem-solving, collaboration, and independence
- Employers consistently report no behavior issues and high motivation from student interns
- The program builds professional confidence: student Najaax Sheikh Ali went from doubting herself to being "stunned" by her own contributions
- Former interns credit the program with developing professional skills and confidence they previously lacked

High school senior Najaax Sheikh Ali initially doubted whether she could succeed in a corporate environment. "What happens if they don't like this aspect of me?" she worried. However, after joining Genesys Works, a national internship nonprofit, her confidence grew through summer training and professional placement.

Sheikh Ali now works at SPS Commerce in Minneapolis, helping employees troubleshoot technology issues. "When I saw the fruits of my labor, I was stunned," she reflected on her experience.

### The Program's Reach

Genesys Works, founded in Houston in 2002, has placed approximately 1,100 students in internships across 202 companies during the current school year. The program operates in eight metropolitan areas: Chicago, Houston, Jacksonville, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York, San Francisco, Tulsa, and Washington, D.C.

Students work 15-20 hours weekly at $14-18 hourly rates. Major employers participating include Target, Accenture, 3M, and Medtronic, offering roles in information technology, marketing, and human resources.

### Why Companies Participate

The nonprofit removes administrative obstacles that typically discourage employers from hiring teenagers. Genesys Works handles recruiting, application review, mentor pairing, school coordination, and serves as the official employer -- managing payroll and insurance.

Companies pay roughly double students' wages for this comprehensive support. Peggy Krendl, senior managing partner at Accenture, noted: "We don't have to worry about that at all, so it's an entire infrastructure and onboarding support network."

### Pre-Internship Training

Before placement, students complete an eight-week summer program covering six skill bundles: communication, time management, work ethic, problem-solving, collaboration, and independence. Instructors evaluate students' punctuality, receptiveness to feedback, and engagement throughout.

### Real-World Results

Employers consistently report positive outcomes. Lauren Loeffler, who manages interns at SPS, stated: "I have never seen a behavior issue... They are extremely motivated to do a good job."

Land O' Lakes, which hires approximately a dozen interns yearly, observed that despite an initial adjustment period, students quickly contribute meaningfully to their teams.

Former intern Yareni Flores, now attending community college, credits the program with developing professional skills and confidence she lacked previously.
