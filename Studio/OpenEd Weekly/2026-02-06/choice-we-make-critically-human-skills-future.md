## Summary
Abel and Nate McClennen present the CHOICE framework for reimagining education in the age of AI, arguing that society faces a critical decision between a "Passive Culture" (where humans cede agency to algorithms) and a "Purpose Culture" (where AI amplifies distinctly human capabilities). The framework identifies six competencies -- Critical Thinking, Healthy Living, Originality, Inquiry, Connection, and Emotional Intelligence -- that education must prioritize.

## Key Points
- Two futures: "Passive Culture" (humans depend on AI for thinking/creativity, lose agency) vs. "Purpose Culture" (AI as tool amplifying human capabilities)
- AI investment is exponentially larger than investment in human skills necessary to co-exist with AI
- Critical challenges: declining human attention, AI-generated misinformation, replacement of human connection with AI-mediated platforms
- The CHOICE framework: Critical Thinking, Healthy Living, Originality, Inquiry, Connection, Emotional Intelligence
- These six competencies support three foundational outcomes: Agency, Compassion, and Integrity -- qualities AI cannot possess
- Education systems must shift from industrial-age models toward cultivating these critically human skills
- The goal is genuine human-AI partnership rather than human dependence

## Full Content

The authors present a framework for reimagining education in response to artificial intelligence's rapid advancement. They argue that society faces a critical choice between two futures.

### The Two Paths

The first path -- the "Passive Culture" -- represents a world where humans increasingly depend on AI for critical thinking and creativity, gradually losing agency to algorithm-driven systems. The alternative, the "Purpose Culture," envisions AI as a tool amplifying distinctly human capabilities rather than replacing them.

### Core Problem

The authors identify a dangerous imbalance: "AI Investment is exponentially larger than the investment in human skills necessary to co-exist with AI." They highlight several critical challenges, including declining human attention, AI-generated misinformation, and replacement of human connection with "AI-mediated platforms."

### The CHOICE Framework

The solution involves six competencies that remain essential regardless of AI development:

- **Critical Thinking:** analyzing information and identifying bias
- **Healthy Living:** sustaining physical, mental, and spiritual well-being
- **Originality:** generating new ideas from human experience
- **Inquiry:** maintaining curiosity and asking meaningful questions
- **Connection:** building meaningful relationships and collaboration
- **Emotional Intelligence:** understanding and managing emotions

These skills support three foundational outcomes: Agency, Compassion, and Integrity -- qualities the authors argue AI cannot possess.

### Vision

The authors conclude that education systems must urgently shift from industrial-age models toward cultivating these critically human skills, enabling genuine human-AI partnership rather than human dependence.
