## Guest Info / Relevant Context

Ela’s Notes: 


0:00: The podcast today with Gretchen Rowe was great.
0:03: She's a homeschool mom and advocate.
0:06: we kind of just went all over the place with her experience homeschooling 6 different kids, how different kids are, how she managed her family, the relationship between trust and, a family, and just like.
0:22: How that's the bedrock of a really good homeschool experience.
0:27: also the fact that some sometimes homeschoolers don't get the soft skills very much like their parents overindex on all of the hard skills, the academics.
0:37: She did that in the beginning, and then, How it's actually quite important that they get all those soft skills as well.
0:44: , I'm really intrigued by her.
0:48: This episode was good, but actually she has a ton of relationships inside of the education space, and she's kind of been one of those like education.
0:57: People that's just like always involved in something.
0:59: She's involved in tons of the conventions around the US.
1:05: She's involved in a lot of different types of things like that.
1:07: So, she actually connected me with a couple of people after this call.
1:12: some that we should totally get on the podcast, and then a couple that she just wants us to know for like what Open Et offers.
1:19: So, that'll be really interesting to dive into and then,, something else was, Yeah,

0:00: And then the last piece of this, Charlie, is that they have a podcast and a newsletter and she definitely wants to cross promote this.
0:06: So if we can just make sure that she gets every asset that we publish, and not just like final copies, but also, source material too, so that she can repost the article, link back to Opened, all this, the SEO stuff that we were talking about, she'd be prime candidate for that.

Chavilah,

I was chatting with a colleague and friend, Gretchen Roe, from Demme Learning. She hosts their podcast “The Demme Learning Show”. She would love a copy of Matt’s book and a chat about potentially having him on her podcast. Is that something you might be interested in doing?

**Chavilah: **

Hi Janna,

We'd love to send her a book! Unfortunately, Matt is taking a break from doing podcasts, but if Gretchen is interested, we'd love to have her on an episode of the OpenEd Podcast.

Let me know, and I can coordinate sending a book and a time for the podcast!

**Janna: **

Chavilah,

I’m looping Gretchen into the mix! I will let you gals handle it from here. I am so grateful for the opportunity to host Matt. Thank you for making that happen!

**Gretchen: **

Hi Chavilah! (What a beautiful name.  I would love to know the story.)

I absolutely would love to receive a copy of the book and would be honored to participate in OpenEd's podcast. I appreciate that Matt is taking a break from podcasts.  Perhaps we can talk about him doing an episode in the future, as I typically book guests six months in advance and am looking at my June 2026 calendar now.

My address is 2307 Old Kanuga Road, Hendersonville, NC 28739

I will look forward to collaborating with you.

Cordially,

**Chavilah: **
