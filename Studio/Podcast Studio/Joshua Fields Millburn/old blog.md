**When School Becomes Clutter: One Father’s Decision to Remove the Desks**

Joshua Fields Millburn didn’t know he was dyslexic until he was forty years old.

"I was in a public school system that was, I don’t know, adequate for most people," he recalls. He struggled through school, collected detentions for missing homework, tried to drop out his senior year. Standardized tests never captured what he could do. "I just assumed that reading was really difficult."

It wasn't until his daughter Ella started struggling to read that the picture came into focus. She did some dyslexia tests. He did them with her.

"And I’m like, oh."

Ella went to kindergarten and first grade at a public school in Missoula, Montana — Spanish immersion, good offerings, the kind of school that works well for most families. And yet she was miserable.

"She would come home with stomach aches," Joshua remembers. "She’d have stomach aches in the morning with the anxiety of going and being forced to try to read or try to participate in things that were more difficult for her than other kids."

The labels came: dyslexia, ADHD. Within the system, they tried several things. None of it worked.

Most parents, at this point, would accept that this is just how school is. Some kids struggle. You push through. You hope it gets better.

Joshua and his wife didn’t accept it.

"We started researching and figuring out what’s the next best path forward," he says, "because what we’re doing right now doesn’t work. And we’ve tried several things within the system and it still doesn’t work. So we need to find a new path forward."

The path they found was an unschool in Southern California — a husband and wife who had bought an old school building the town wasn’t using anymore and removed all the desks.

"Effectively it’s like going to a school place, but there is no school," Joshua explains. He often describes it as "Lord of the Flies, but with a couple of adults on the island."

"It’s highly competitive, right?" Joshua acknowledges. "But I think that type of competition is a mental illness... It’s like I’m signing a contract with myself to be discontented until I get the thing that I want. And that thing can be graduating from a prestigious kindergarten or it could be going to the quote-unquote right college."

The ancient Greeks had a word for this: *pleonexia* — greed for things that can be counted.

Think grades. Test scores. Accolades. Square footage.

"What are my accolades of things that can be counted?" Joshua asks. "And of course that discounts the things that there are no measurements for. Like I don’t have — how many square feet of joy do you have in your life? How many yards of peace have I acquired this year?"

When asked what his number one job as a parent is, Joshua’s answer is disarmingly simple.

"My number one job as a parent is to not screw my daughter up. And I know that’s really vague and nebulous, but it’s a heuristic by which I ask: is this going to screw her up?"

It’s not a prescription. It’s a question. And sometimes the answer means removing the desks.
