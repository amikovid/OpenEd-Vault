## Rough Transcript

Isaac (00:01.08)
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I am super excited to be here with Joshua Fields Milburn. He is part of the Minimalists. And if you don't know, I can't believe you don't know. If you don't know, the Minimalists are an Emmy nominated group of Netflix stars, New York Times bestselling authors, podcast hosts. It's Joshua Fields Milburn who's with us today, Ryan Nicodemus.

and my good friend who's been on the podcast before TK Coleman, and they have helped millions of people, not just eliminate clutter in the physical sense of minimalism, not having too much stuff and learning how to live with less, but really it's a much deeper philosophy of emotional clutter, getting rid of those things, a lot of things that, a lot more than you would expect. So really excited to have you here, Josh. Welcome to the podcast.

Joshua (00:54.41)
Isaac, thanks so much. You're right. The clutter thing is fascinating because you think of minimalism, you often think about decluttering, right? And it's like, okay, we got all this physical stuff. And that's the easiest clutter to see, right? The average American household has 300,000 items in it. And I'd be fine if it was all making us happier and more joyous. And it ends up being the opposite. It causes all this other clutter, the mental clutter, the emotional clutter, you mentioned relationship clutter, career clutter, education.

I'm sure we could talk about several of those things today, but thanks for thanks for having me

Isaac (01:29.326)
Yeah, you know, it's funny. So I went on your podcast a while ago and you just kind of in passing mentioned something about, you know, your daughter was in school, it wasn't working out and you made a big switch in her education. And I wanna get to that in a second. That's kind of what prompted this conversation. But as I was thinking today and preparing for it, it just hit me. You have one of your bestselling books is called...

one of the greatest titles ever. It's one of those books where if you only read the title, you already got a ton of value. Love people use things. And I know you guys say that a lot, like reminding us where things go. Love people use things. And it made me think, man, that is actually really similar to what we talk about with parents at Open Ed all the time, which is like love kids use education.

school, curricula, different pedagogical approaches, these are tools. Those are not the thing that should be doing the driving. It's your kid and what they need. Love them, focus on them, use all those things as tools. So maybe that's a cheap ripoff of your amazing phrase, but I wanna start with your own education. How were you educated? How has that impacted you? And kind of like before you had kids, cause I know for all of us, that's when we start thinking really differently about these things.

What was your sort of personal experience and approach to education?

Joshua (02:55.374)
Yeah, I grew up really poor and I was in a public school system that was, I don't know, adequate for most people. I didn't realize when I was young, I'm dyslexic. My daughter is too. And but I didn't realize until I had a daughter that I was dyslexic. I mean, she was struggling to read. I'm like, well, yeah, reading is just really hard, right? And and and they're like, no. And she did some of these dyslexia tests and I did them with her and I'm like, oh, it was so I.

I'm finding out when I'm like, you know, about 40 years old that I'm dyslexic and I'm, and maybe like there's a problem with pathologizing something like that, because I think for some of us, like I never knew that I had this disease or problem or malfunction in my brain, as I've heard it described. And, to me, I just assumed that reading was really difficult, but it actually made me love writing in a way. Cause I got to play with the words and piece them together. And so it became a strange.

sort of superpower. I did not get along well in school, though I was a fairly average student, a lot of detentions mostly for not turning in homework, not necessarily behavior, although I had a few of those two, but I didn't enjoy being there. I wasn't the type of person who wanted to wait to raise his hand and be called on. standardized testing did not work very well for me. I was relatively bright, but my test scores didn't.

show it at all. In fact, it kind of looked the opposite. There were some years I struggled to even pass a grade and there were a few subjects that worked really well for me that I enjoyed and I tended to get better grades in those subjects because that was compelled by them. And I, last year high school, I tried to drop out and my guidance counselor, Mr. Day, shout out to Mr. Day.

Uh, 1998, this was, um, as I was going into my senior year, I tried to drop out. He's like, well, you shouldn't because all you need is this one last class this year. And so how about I give you nothing but study halls and you take this one last class, uh, for the half of, uh, for one semester and this next semester, you don't even have to show up. And I was like, okay, that that'll work. And so I tried to, to, I even failed at dropping out of high school.

Isaac (05:14.698)
You

Joshua (05:16.136)
And I skipped the whole college route and just went into the corporate world thereafter just because I figured that I didn't want to spend more time doing something that I disliked. And that's not to say that it's not appropriate for other people. You just talked about that in a moment. If we're talking about a moment ago, if you're talking about education clutter here, the way that I think about clutter is anything that gets in the way. And so I was explaining this to my daughter this morning.

She was asking something about clutter and I said, is our coffee grinder clutter? And she said, well, no, of course not. You use it every day. I said, that's right. I use it in its context. If I put it in your bed before you went to sleep, all of a sudden it would be clutter because it would get in your way. so different things get in the way of different people at different times in different contexts. And I realized that school wasn't appropriate for me, but it seems to be perfectly appropriate for certain people. And so

It's not a prescription as to, think school is bad and here's a better way. Here's a better way for me. And eventually I found a better way for my daughter after she really struggled in a couple of years of public school.

Isaac (06:24.301)
You mentioned something in passing that I just can't let go by, because it's a really interesting point. You mentioned that you found out later that you were dyslexic. And you kind of said offhand, there is a downside to sort pathologizing certain things. And this is one of those really interesting things that can cut both ways. I know a lot of parents that I've talked with, realizing, my kid struggles with dyslexia or ADHD or whatever it might be. Sometimes that is like this

wonderful moment that helps you realize, okay, I have to do something different. So there's, there's an unlock that can happen with having a label or a diagnosis. But there is also a danger to your point. And sometimes it's easy, like I'll notice kids, kids are really good at weaponizing this. They'll be like, well, I have ADHD, so you can't make me do it. And you're like, what do mean by that? You just don't want to clean your room. You just don't want to sit down for a minute at the dinner table. Like you're using that label. So I'm curious.

Joshua (07:15.917)
Hmm.

Isaac (07:23.137)
in education or otherwise, because I'm sure all the people you deal with, there are probably times where they're like, yeah, I've got all this clutter, but it's because I have this disorder. Do you have any thoughts on the line between coming up with a label or a diagnosis pathologizing as a danger versus as a health?

Joshua (07:43.446)
Yeah, yeah, I tend to think of it as a label versus an identity, right? And so if my label is I'm a writer, right, and that actually applies only when I'm writing. And so everyone's a writer, we all write text messages. What do mean by I'm a writer, right? And that's not a problem. It's to describe something I'm speaking into a microphone that is a label. I saw a tree this morning. That's a label, right? It describes a thing or a set of things.

But as soon as it becomes my identity, I am a writer or I am dyslexic. So now it's actually disempowering. And so I find that any time that a label transitions into becoming identity, this is who I am. That becomes a bit of a problem. The way I teach, I teach writing class and what I teach my writing students, it's online, is that I'm much more interested in the verb than I am the noun. What do I mean by that? So

The noun is I am a writer and that sounds impressive and it's erudite and okay, what does it mean? Right? I'm much more interested in the verb, the writing, than I am the label or identity as writer because what am I writing? And is it making a difference? Is it meaningful to me? And do other people find value? And if it's adding value to their lives, great. It doesn't matter what label you throw at me.

Isaac (09:05.903)
you

Joshua (09:10.018)
What matters is I did the writing, the verb itself. And I think you can map that onto the so-called pathologies as well. I have OCD and that is a gift and a curse. It is a disease. It's a mental illness as it is labeled, right? But also, man, it is like the most amazing superpower when it is channeled. And so what am I going to do with this label that I have?

It's just like any object, right? If I have a baseball bat, is that a weapon or is it a tool? Depends on how I use it.

Isaac (09:49.252)
That OCD, by the way, I think I've seen just a glimpse of it when I came into your studio. It's so perfectly clean. Everyone takes their shoes off immediately. There's like little protocols around there that feel kind of OCD, but the result is it is this like sacred, peaceful like place. So there you go. It's a positive. Let's talk about your daughter. How old is your daughter? Okay, she's 12. And what was her...

Joshua (10:12.686)
She's 12.

Isaac (10:17.387)
early education experience, what were kind of your thoughts when she was just sort of getting started formally or informally with education.

Joshua (10:24.246)
We live in Southern California now, but at the time she was born in Missoula, Montana. And so she went to kindergarten and first grade in Missoula, Montana to a really good public school that was there was Spanish immersion and the offerings at this public school were pretty great. And yet she was miserable. mean,

she would come home with stomach ache. She'd have stomach aches in the morning with the anxiety of going and, and being forced to try to read or try to participate in things that were more difficult for her than other kids. And there are other times where she really loved that she's super athletic and, she's easygoing and there are parts that she was able to amplify through these social interactions. But anytime she was told to sit down and focus, it was really difficult. And so,

One of those other labels ADHD was thrown at her as well. And eventually we learned about this dyslexia diagnosis and those labels were useful in helping us understand why maybe that system didn't work as well for her. And so we started researching and figuring out what's the next best path forward because what we're doing right now doesn't work. And we've tried several things within the system and it still doesn't work. So we need to find a new path forward.

Is that a different school? Is it a private school? Is it tutoring? Is it homeschool? And then we learned about this thing called unschooling, which I'm sure you're familiar with at this point. And it's sort of self-directed learning. And the town that we live in here in Southern California has a great unschool program where the students are effectively homeschooled, but then they can go to this new

Unschool it's actually in an old school this husband and wife couple bought this old school that the town wasn't using anymore and removed all the desks. So effectively it's like going to a school place, but there is no school there's

Isaac (12:30.639)
It sounds kind of like Sudbury Valley School. I don't know if you're familiar with that, but that's started a long time ago in New England, but it's very similar. It's like they have a building and we have grounds and we have different resources and materials and kids can do it. But the kids, there's some chaperones, but the kids just basically do whatever they want. They're self-guided more or less. So like they have a place to go. They can be around other kids for parents who aren't able to stay home with them.

But there's no structured curriculum. They sort of set the tone themselves and the adults are there to like help them out with whatever they want help with.

Joshua (13:04.45)
Yeah, I often describe it as Lord of the Flies, but with a couple adults on the island. And it turns out that had there been some adults on the island, think that because they put up the guard rails because you know, it is, I think my number one job as a parent is to not screw my daughter up. And I know that's really vague and nebulous, but it's a heuristic by which I ask like, okay, is this going to screw her up?

And, and if so, how much it doesn't mean like, of course she's going to skin her leg and, she's going to have ouchies here and there. But I also, when she was two years old, didn't let her play in traffic because she needed to have some sort of boundaries that she was not yet cognitively able to form on her own. And I think a, a good unschool program does that. This place has no teachers, but there are mentors there. So there are adults that can help.

There's a recording studio there. There's a band instruments. There's an art room. There's a bug room. There are gardens. So she learns how to garden and farm and, there are musicals. And so it's, really is self directed. She's in, she's doing filmmaking right now, just because it's something that she's interested in, in trying out. And of course there's the at home stuff that she has to do with reading and

and writing and math and not a whole lot of that gets done in that environment, although there are opportunities for it. But I find that the self-directed learning, she's able to delight herself in a way that she was never delighted by the public school system. And so there are a ton of upsides. I haven't seen much in way of downsides yet for her specifically.

The place that she goes is like pre-K through 12th grade. You can go there. there aren't many high school students there though. There are, because school is an interesting thing. It's the only place that I'm aware of that we segregate based on age. And if you were to go to a corporate job and you're working in a cubicle on the 17th floor at XYZ corporation,

Joshua (15:25.056)
And you're 26 years old and you start today. They're not going to put you in the section with all the 26 year olds and say next year you'll be over there with the 27 year olds. It, you would look at them like they're insane. And yet we, we've just accepted it as perfectly normal. Now I understand the kids are in different stages of development, but why not then intermingle them with other kids? So Ella's 12, she's been going there since she was seven and so five.

Isaac (15:31.404)
Okay.

Joshua (15:54.19)
plus years, five and a half years at this point. And she is with six year olds and 16 year olds and they're all in the same room and she's teaching the six year old stuff and she's learning from the, 16 year olds. And by the way, she's also learning from the six year olds. You know, this is a parent, you've got four kids, right? Isaac. Yeah. So the, there's like an old adage that the, teacher ends up learning more than the student. would say that is true about parenting as well. If parenting has done well.

Isaac (16:13.773)
Yeah. Yeah.

Joshua (16:24.266)
I end up learning more from my daughter about patience and wonder and awe and curiosity. Then she learns about the rules for living from me.

Isaac (16:34.671)
You said something, I love this. I kind of ripping off a word from theology. The apophatic approach to parenting is kind of what I call it or education, which is rather than asking what is good parenting or what is a good education, just flipping that around and saying, what is not bad? Like, how do I not do? And I always tell young people with their career, don't do stuff you hate. You don't know what you love yet. As long as you don't do stuff that sucks your soul.

and keep moving forward. You'll keep adding to the list of things you hate until you end up somewhere you love. And I think with parenting, with education, it's really stressful to be like, what's the perfect approach? What do I need to do well and do right? And I love that you just said, like, how do I not screw up my child's life? How do I not make the big errors? And just like,

Put that list over there of things that are not working well, things that don't seem to be getting right outcomes, seem to be causing problems, and like, don't do those things. But then everything else, I think it's really hard. Parents get really panicked. And you know this from, I'm sure, your own experience and then talking to other parents with, if everything seems okay, nothing's terrible is happening, but like, what if they're behind? What if they're not where they're supposed to be? What if something horrible?

Joshua (17:51.116)
Hmm.

Isaac (17:54.318)
Are they supposed to be doing something that I haven't even thought? Should I be teaching them to code? I heard somewhere that coding is the future. I, like, how do you recommend for yourself and others combating that sense of panic that can jump in that says, yeah, my kid seems happy and I think they're learning and nothing horrible is happening. But like, is there something I'm missing out on that someday I'm gonna realize, my gosh, I screwed up by not teaching them this. How do you combat that panic?

Joshua (18:21.132)
There are no shoulds, there are only coulds. So should my daughter be enrolled in a sport? Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus at some point? No, there are no shoulds with respect to education. There are only coulds. She can do any of those things. The question is, is she compelled by any of them? And if so, her likelihood for success is

So much higher. So the question then is, what are you compelled by? And I know the answer is often, I don't know. I don't know what's interesting. I'm sure you do. You just can't intellectualize it in the moment, but you know it when you, when you sit there, when you do it and, and you look up at the clock and it's way later than you thought because time was just dripping by so quickly. All of a sudden it went from a subtle drip, drip, drip when she's in the classroom trying to read and being forced to raise her hand.

And then all of a sudden the time is just soaking the table because there's so much immersion when you're interested in something. We've all had that experience. Time does really strange things to us, right? Where you're in a classroom and you just keep looking up at the clock. Is this over? And feels like the clock is going backwards. It's just not moving. And there are other times where it's just like, wow.

That was already two hours. I can't believe it. And yet it's the same unit of measurement. The only thing that's different is I found something that was engaging to me, something that I was compelled by. so trying to understand what our kids are compelled by is a much better barometer for me than what is compelling according to the dictates of society.

Isaac (20:11.267)
I'm really curious about screens and technology and how you think about that with your daughter. I know you guys on The Minimalists have, you don't do a bunch of stuff. I know you've done social media fasts at various points. I know you're very much aware of the addictive nature and the problems that can come from that.

Joshua (20:14.786)
Hmm. Hmm.

Isaac (20:34.807)
And then there's also like a, I don't want to run away from the world. it's like, here we are doing a podcast. You mentioned a recording studio. Technology is a tool as long as it's a tool and it doesn't become a master. And how do you, or how does the school, the unschool that your daughter is a part of, how do you deal with that? What is, what is the thinking there? Is it like, Hey, if you want to play Roblox or Minecraft all day, go for it. Or is there some kind of strictures or guard rails there?

Joshua (20:59.778)
Would you ever give your kids fentanyl?

Isaac (21:01.647)
I love that answer.

Joshua (21:07.726)
See, I thought that too until my daughter had a surgery right and she had a surgery on her scalp She had third degree burns in her scalp when she was one year old it was a case of negligence at the place that was watching her and she rubbed her head against that mesh lining repeatedly and had a third degree burn on her head and she's had to have three surgeries on that now and During that surgery she was given fentanyl right and

Isaac (21:28.931)
Wow.

Joshua (21:36.224)
It makes sense in that context, right? And, and I think the same thing is true. TK Ryan and I just did a Ted X talk called scrolling is the new smoking. And it was about our year off of social media and what we learned about it in 2023, we had our most successful year ever in terms of reach, you know, success in terms of the things that can be measured, right?

Isaac (21:38.881)
That's a great analogy.

Joshua (22:04.032)
Ancient Greeks had a word for this, was pleonexia, which roughly translates to greed for things that can be counted.

Isaac (22:12.303)
We're going to have to put that as the word of the week in our newsletter. That's awesome.

Joshua (22:18.062)
Yeah. so it's, we always are thinking about the things that can be counted, right? What grades did I get? How much money is in the bank account? What is my square footage? what are my accolades of things that can be counted? And of course that discounts, of course the things that there are no measurements for. Like I don't have, how many square feet of joy do you have in your life? Right? How many yards of peace have I acquired this year? And so

I found that when we were really successful in social media, it became a type of consumerism in a way where it was like, how do I get more? That's the problem with consumerism. More, more, more, more. It's never enough. And so we always need more of the things or more of the acquisition, more of the craving. Consumerism is an ideology that says acquiring more will make me happy or complete.

And I think it's possible to do that with social media and it becomes even more addictive. know, know, else's addictive fentanyl is addictive, but even that has a, a purpose. so what I've learned from, took a whole year off social media after we reached half a billion people, but that was something we counted, right? That doesn't really measure anything because what most of those I know now are just like eight tenths of a second. Does that mean anything at all? No, it's just a.

It's just a metric, right? And so it doesn't measure the depth that measures the width. And so when I think about screens, I think about them in my own life. And there are two things that have that have helped me. One is I need to model the behavior for my daughter. So we have something called the entryway rule in our home. And that's where our phones go. My wife and I, my daughter does not have a phone and she won't have a phone, but until she's old enough to have one.

likely 18, but I'd be willing to talk about it at 16. And we leave our phone at the door. It's the entryway rule. So I can still use it like a home phone. I'm not deprived of the thing, but the distractions don't follow me around the house. I'm not distracted on the couch or in the kitchen or in the bedroom. mean, the bedroom is a worse place for a phone. And so because I could tell her not to use screens, but that she's just

Joshua (24:39.774)
hears that right but if she sees that we're not using screens and they have a place I can still go send a text message I can still go make a phone call if I need to but I don't need the distractions to follow me around now personally I don't I don't use social media on my phone anymore I do have social media accounts but I've just found that they're they're too tempting to have on my phone because we used to have these little interstitial zones waiting rooms or you go out for a walk and

And, you would have the space to think, to ruminate, but now every interstitial zone and every moment is filled with the potential for distraction. The tug. And it's not just social media either. can be text messages. what is, what is disrupting us? Because the things that disrupt us are often clutter. They, they get in the way.

I will tell you the other thing is putting limits on screen time for my daughter. The worst way I've ever screwed up my daughter is I got her an iPad years ago. And it is the most unfortunate thing that I've done, I think. And so we've had to find guardrails for that that are appropriate. Certain things need to be done before she can watch it. There are parental controls on it. Don't allow her to watch it for more than an hour after she's done certain things.

And of course, if we need to take it away because it's getting in the way of something else, then we will, but we won't do it punitively. Because I think that could be traumatizing to kids. We don't realize, again, I don't want to screw my daughter up by giving her an iPad. I don't want to screw her up even more by yanking out her hands and making her resent me or resent technology or resent authority just because she has an emotional response to that.

Isaac (26:29.295)
Yeah, that's a really good insight that the cure can sometimes be worse than the error. Growing up, my mom is amazing, I'm not throwing her into the bus, but she had this tendency, she is very charitable and takes everything in good faith. And she always had this feeling like she could have been doing more and better as a parent. So she would listen to some new, back in the day it was cassette tape, some new cassette tape from some person I'm parenting.

and suddenly be like, I've been doing everything wrong. We're making a complete overhaul. Everything's totally different. Everything we've been doing was bad. You know, you can't do this anymore. And then eventually we would just laugh. We wouldn't take it seriously because it was like, this isn't going to last. It was too extreme, right? It was like, that's it. I heard a podcast. I'm throwing away the iPad, but I'm with you. I mean, I'm the same with my oldest. He's 20. And so I like to give, if I'm trying to be as gracious with myself as possible and not.

really hard on myself, say, well, you I was only 21 when he was born and 20 years ago, none of us realized how addictive this stuff was. Like social media had barely been invented and whatever, but I, each kid, I feel like has gotten a better version of me as a parent. As we've gone with my four kids and my eight year old, we have a very good system of how and when screens are used and for what purposes. And I feel totally at peace about that. With my oldest, I'm like,

Son, I'm sorry. And by the way, at age 20, he has a flip phone. He switched to a flip phone on his own because he was like, I cannot control myself if I have an iPhone. I like YouTube videos, I like podcasts, and I just get sucked down. I tell myself it's productive, but I've tried everything else. None of it works. I need a phone, I need texts and phone calls, and it has GPS as well. And he just got himself a flip phone.

Joshua (28:18.68)
Hmm.

Isaac (28:20.899)
So anyway, and I partially am like, I wish you were at a spot where you didn't feel like that was the only option, but I think I didn't do a good enough job when he was young. And he's like, that's a struggle for him.

Joshua (28:26.477)
Yeah.

Joshua (28:32.588)
Yeah, I think it's something that we all struggle with is understanding how do we incorporate these technologies into our lives as adults, but then how do we incorporate into the kids life not how in terms of like, the what's the prescription, but let me understand how this is helping and how it's harming. And the truth is that unfettered

relationships, look up videos for iPad kids, just type in iPad kids into YouTube and the meltdowns. Because we use these phones as pacifiers. We use our screens as pacifiers. And I understand why we do it. I am also I also have that tug to, hey, I'd love to just have some downtime and not have to engage every moment. And so here's a screen to is really a smoke screen between me and my child.

Isaac (29:27.659)
It's a huge, huge challenge. It's funny. It's like one of the number one, it's one of the number one things that I think all parents are facing. And to me, I'm really optimistic and positive because it is so well known now that this is a struggle. And the answer again is not burn technology to the ground. It's, this is, really immature. And all of a sudden we received a handgun when we were toddlers. Now we got to figure out when and where, how do we grow into our use of it? Okay, so let's.

Joshua (29:52.524)
Mm.

Isaac (29:57.744)
Let's wrap it up with a little, give me like minimalism and education. And we've touched on this in a handful of ways, but if you were to kind of summarize how the philosophy of minimalism, how that applies to education. And I'm particularly thinking of lot of parents who listen to this, who are feeling, especially when kids get to middle school and high school, like their lives are the...

opposite of minimalist because they're like, okay, they want to do sports, they want to do this, I want to do this curriculum, I'm trying to make sure that they can do this, I'm trying to get them ready to go into college, and it's just more, more, more, more, more. And it's all good intentions. It's not necessarily more in the sense of like, I'm buying a bunch of toys I don't need, but it's like, there's no end to the amount of driving I'm doing, signing up for things, kids schedules, kids homework, kids. How does minimalism help as a starting point, people to kind of...

get free from that hedonic treadmill in the education space.

Joshua (31:00.108)
Yeah, it's highly competitive, right? But I think that type of competition is a mental illness. And I know that's not popular to say. And I mean it literally, I don't mean that it's bad. Like I have OCD, that's a mental illness. It's a label. It's not an identity, right? But competition like that is a is a mental illness, the striving. It's like I'm signing a contract with myself to be discontented until I get the thing that I want.

And that thing can be graduating from a prestigious kindergarten Or it could be going to the quote-unquote right college that I quote-unquote should go to right it can be honors it can be valedictorian and The problem with that is that's another type of consumerism. It makes you think that happiness is out there and it can be acquired we do that with our objects and then

Isaac (31:35.256)
You

Joshua (31:59.276)
Yeah, you buy the new BMW and I think there's anything wrong with a BMW. I also know that it's not going to make you happy. And, and I know that if you buy it, you feel that rush of, well, what you mistake for is happiness. It's pleasure, right? But that pleasure is fleeting, necessarily fleeting. And of course, then you feel the discontent when that first of 83 car payments shows up in the mail and it's like, no, what, what did I do? Right?

Isaac (32:24.047)
Thank

Joshua (32:27.182)
And it's because I was competing in a way I was trying to look impressive, sound impressive, be impressive. I was trying to impress people I've never even met and probably won't ever meet. And I recognize that at this point, I don't want my daughter to compete in that way. Now there's friendly fun competition too. You know, we're dribbling a basketball in the backyard. That's a different thing. That's playful.

But as soon as your happiness is tied to an outcome you lose the happiness that's in the present moment How does that tie it back into minimalism? Well, you realize with minimalism the joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered It's buried beneath the clutter and in our physical lives in our physical homes. That's often real tangible physical clutter

But our material possessions are merely a physical manifestation of what's going on inside us. So I have a lot of clutter out there. I probably have a lot of clutter in here. And I apply that to education the same way. What is getting in the way? What is clutter? And for my daughter, the public school system was a type of clutter. Standardized testing was a type of clutter. It was getting in the way of her life, of her joy, of her peace. It doesn't mean that she

Shouldn't do things that are challenging. In fact, she does things that are more challenging now than ever before it means that That struggle does not need to be the beacon for success

Isaac (34:06.927)
Yeah, the more you suffer, the better it is for you. Not necessarily the case. I talk about this all the time, too, like when I always say, as I mentioned before, don't do stuff you hate, but hate is not the same as hard. Like I'm not saying don't do stuff that's hard, you know, and you see kids, you see kids working on a Lego set or trying to beat a level in a video game and it's hard, but they're having a blast. They love it. It's a meaningful kind of challenge. Final question for you.

Joshua (34:20.977)
Hmm.

Joshua (34:31.598)
Mm-hmm.

Isaac (34:37.279)
If parents want to, not just for themselves, I know for themselves you guys have all kinds of books, resources, if they want to introduce their kids to the concept of minimalism, where's the best place to start? You have a children's book coming out?

Joshua (34:48.982)
Yeah. a thought. TK wrote one. We've been trying to get it published. It's really great. The best place to start, I know this from sort of the empirical evidence. I remember when Ryan and I first started The Minimalist before TK came along, we would go out on book tour. We had written some books and we'd often have like parents in their thirties and forties or even fifties and

They'd bring, you know, one of their kids with them, 11 year old or 15 year old with them, sort of drag their kids out and say, you kids need to hear about this. But then I remember when our first documentary hit Netflix and all of a sudden our tour stops are live events. It was a bunch of teenagers who were dragging their parents in and saying, Hey mom and dad, you've got to, you've got a lot of stuff. You need to see what these guys are, are talking about. So we have a documentary on Netflix right now called the minimalist's less is now.

Isaac (35:34.639)
You

Isaac (35:39.279)
You

Joshua (35:45.132)
And then our first documentary, got the rights back from Netflix. A couple of years ago, we put it up on YouTube. It is called Minimalism. I think either one of those are a great entry point into our work.

Isaac (35:55.087)
That's awesome. I would have been one of those kids. My mom had way too much stuff. I would have been trying to make her watch that Netflix documentary as a teenager for sure. Joshua Fields Milburn, the minimalist himself. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast and sharing a little bit of your story.

Joshua (36:03.064)
Ha ha ha.

Joshua (36:11.66)
It's my pleasure. Thanks, Isaac.
