# Joshua Fields Millburn: When "Reading Is Just Hard" Turns Out to Be Something Else

Ella was in kindergarten and first grade - athletic, easygoing, and social. But every morning before school, she had stomach aches. Every afternoon, she came home with more of them.

She was attending a Spanish immersion public school in Missoula, Montana - by most measures, a good school with great offerings. But something was wrong. Whenever she was told to sit down and focus, to try to read, to participate in ways that were harder for her than other kids, it fell apart.

Her father recognized the struggle. [Joshua Fields Millburn](https://www.theminimalists.com/) - co-founder of [The Minimalists](https://www.theminimalists.com/), Emmy-nominated filmmaker, and *New York Times* bestselling author of [*Love People, Use Things*](https://www.theminimalists.com/lput/) - had spent decades helping millions of people declutter their lives. But watching his daughter, he saw something familiar: his own childhood.

Joshua grew up poor in a public school system he describes as "adequate for most people." He wasn't the type to wait to raise his hand. Standardized testing didn't work for him. His test scores looked like they belonged to someone struggling, even though he was relatively bright.

"I got a lot of detentions, mostly for not turning in homework," he recalls. By senior year, he tried to drop out entirely. His guidance counselor, Mr. Day, worked out a deal: one last class for one semester, then he didn't even have to show up. "I even failed at dropping out of high school."

Through all of it, one thing seemed clear to Joshua: reading was just really difficult. That's how it was for everyone, right?

Labels started getting thrown around for Ella: ADHD. Dyslexia. They tried several approaches within the system. Working with the school. Different strategies. None of it worked.

Then came the dyslexia tests. Ella took them. And Joshua - now about 40 years old - took them alongside her.

"I didn't realize until I had a daughter that I was dyslexic. I mean, she was struggling to read. I'm like, well, yeah, reading is just really hard, right? And they're like, no."

Oh.

For four decades, Joshua had walked through the world assuming his experience was universal. That the struggle was normal. That everyone felt this way about words on a page.

Not knowing had given him something, though. "I just assumed that reading was really difficult, but it actually made me love writing in a way. I got to play with the words and piece them together. And so it became a strange sort of superpower."

The family moved to Southern California, where they found an unschool. A husband and wife had bought an old school building the town wasn't using anymore. The first thing they did was remove all the desks.

"So effectively it's like going to a school place, but there is no school."

Joshua describes it as "Lord of the Flies, but with a couple adults on the island." There are no teachers - but there are mentors. There's a recording studio. Band instruments. An art room. A bug room. Gardens where she learns to farm. Kids ages 6 to 16 all in the same space, teaching each other. Ella, now 12, has been there for five years. She's making films - just because she's interested in trying it out.

When [Isaac Morehouse](https://isaacmorehouse.com/) asked Joshua on the [Open Ed podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@OpenEd_HQ) how parents should combat the panic - the fear that they're missing something, that their kid should be learning to code, should be doing more - his answer was simple:

"There are no shoulds, there are only coulds. Should my daughter be enrolled in a sport? Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus at some point? No, there are no shoulds with respect to education. There are only coulds."

The question isn't what society dictates. It's what compels her.

When you find what compels you, Joshua says, time behaves differently. In a classroom being forced to read, every minute drags - it feels like the clock is going backwards. But when you're immersed in something you care about, two hours disappear before you notice.

"For my daughter, the public school system was a type of clutter. Standardized testing was a type of clutter. It was getting in the way of her life, of her joy, of her peace."

The stomach aches are gone.

"Joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered. It's buried beneath the clutter."
