Re “[The Ominous Isolation of the Home-Schooled Child,](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)” by Stefan Merrill Block (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 21):

As a 16-year-old lifelong home-schooler, I can confirm that Mr. Block includes accurate depictions of home-schooling gone wrong, but these examples should not be used to define home-schooling in principle.

To home-school correctly is to empower children to design their own education, and for their parents to structure that curriculum. I’ve examined the home-school world for over a year while filming and editing [“Against the Grade,”](https://www.againstthegrade.com/) a feature-length documentary that offers a look into the lives of home-schooled teenagers like myself. What I’ve concluded is that in education we should be pro-child, not always pro-home-schooling, but certainly against “one size fits all” institutionalism.

Anyone can create an institution around his or her beliefs, and dogma can come from anywhere: public schools, private schools and parents, too. Vast majorities of people in all these organizations and roles are well meaning, trying to accommodate children’s needs in a rapidly evolving world. What we need to avoid is dogma, in both education and civic discourse.

## Ela’s notes:

0:00: Hey y'all, I just finished recording with Mason Ember.
0:03: He was one of the most articulate young kids I have ever met in my entire life, and I was just absolutely blown away.
0:11: I would love to do more with him in the future if we can and just include him in, in different things.
0:18: He is.
0:19: Very, very intelligent.
0:21: He's really good at explaining different either feelings or different things that he is thinking.
0:28: He's very good at thinking through a lot of, he's like basically put together 6 kids or more experience of homeschooling, very different experiences, and he chose them to be very different on purpose.
0:42: And he's kind of parsing through like, what can homeschool look like?
0:46: What are the benefits of homeschool.
0:49: Most families are afraid of the risks associated with homeschool, and he's like the perfect person to speak to that because, you know, most of the people that are telling you how you should homeschool, how you should educate your kids, how you should, how you should parent, they're experts, right?
1:07: They're like, researchers, they're parents, they're, they're, they're different adults.
1:14: And that's not bad.
1:15: Like that's, that's a good thing, right?
1:16: That they've researched, they've looked into this, but From the perspective of a kid, actually, he goes into why homeschoolers love learning, how their pursuit of different skills at different times actually helps them to become more confident adults in the future and how His education is very largely the reason why he believes that he will be such a capable adult, and not only capable but happy.
1:49: He was saying that like the goal of of all of this is how can we help.
1:54: Kids be happy, healthy, just strong individuals.
1:58: And he was saying that through his experience himself homeschooling and now watching through, you know, this documentary and just like really seeing in depth into the lives of the kids that he was following, just how much direction and confidence homeschooling can give a kid.
2:16: So, this was an awesome conversation.
2:18: I think a lot of our parents will like it, especially because You know, they're all insecure.
2:24: Not all of them, but a lot of them are insecure about the question, like, will my kid be OK?
2:28: What are they going to be like in the future?
2:29: What is the right thing to do here?
2:30: And I think as a kid who is very promising and very capable, like, and also happy, he is what they all want their kids to be.
2:41: And he's just telling them that like, hey guys, it's OK to homeschool.
2:44: It's really, really good.
2:46: , you're protecting certain things inside of your kids, and you have this opportunity to build something absolutely amazing.
2:53: So look for those opportunities.
2:55: And he gave a couple of resources that he likes.
2:57: It was more philosophical than very specific.
3:00: So I hope Charlie's not upset about that.
3:02: Sorry, about that, but he was also down to come back on.
3:05: So if you want anything a little bit more tactical, I also didn't want to get into all the tactical because he is going to release the documentary and he doesn't want to spoil it all.
3:12: So,, I mentioned that we'll do something else with him when that goes live.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Bass (00:00.917)
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ella, and today we are joined by Mason Ember. So we actually learned about Mason because he responded to the New York Times post. They had an article about homeschooling and it was kind of a really harsh look at homeschooling. Somebody had had a really difficult experience with it. And Mason came back with a note saying, hey, this is not everyone's experience with homeschooling. So we looked into him a little bit and we were really curious, like,

What is a 16 year old, you know, who is just really interested in homeschooling have to say about this? And it turns out that he's also a filmmaker who's doing a documentary on homeschooling on the different lives of his friends in New York City. So welcome to the podcast.

Mason Ember (00:45.143)
Thanks for having me.

Ela Bass (00:47.019)
So I wanted to start with a question. I was kind of perusing through your Instagram and everybody definitely go follow him on Instagram. And you said that it was actually surprising to you when you started diving into what was happening inside of homeschooling. What surprised you about homeschooling and the way that people were kind of doing it differently than you might have thought?

Mason Ember (01:07.925)
Yeah, that's a really good question. Thanks again for having me on. For me, so I've been homeschooled almost my entire life. I went to preschool briefly, but then I became a preschool dropout. I've been homeschooled, but sort of in and out of the homeschool community because sometimes it's fit my lifestyle and other times it's not. There are co-ops, there are field trips for all ages, right? But sometimes I'm doing more of those.

Ela Bass (01:19.552)
haha

Mason Ember (01:36.365)
and sometimes I'm doing less. But for the most part, it's sort of just been me and my parents, and most of the friends I've had were actually public schoolers for most of my life. I was a big debate kid, so I knew a lot of people through that and other programs. And I kind of always had a mixed feeling about homeschooling. I knew that I liked what we did with it, but my experience, particularly in Connecticut, was just...

that the community wasn't that strong in terms of kind of the connective tissue. Like it was hard to meet people, it was hard to stay friends with people. You would kind of see somebody someplace and then maybe not see them again for a while. I kind of just didn't really think about it much. But then when I started working on the project, I was really struck by, particularly in New York City and with teenagers, just how deep the community runs and

how much of it is run by the teens themselves. There's something amazing to me about this visual of all these teenagers, like 10, sitting in this one girl's apartment and they're doing a book club. But there are no parents, there are no, like there's no supervision, there's no chaperone, it's just these 10 kids.

and they're reading like these classic books, like this month they're reading Madame Bovary, you know, like the books that you would be reading in a school English class. But this is totally kid run. There's no parent in the corner saying, hey, you gotta do this, you know, and it can get rowdy, it can get fun, but for the most part, everyone is really, takes it very seriously. And that's what surprised me about the homeschool community, particularly for teenagers. You my impression was always,

Ela Bass (03:06.817)
Mm-hmm.

Mason Ember (03:27.584)
There are lot of families who homeschool their kids when they're younger. And then a lot of the more mainstream homeschoolers end up switching to high school when they get older because they're worried about socialization. And so experiencing that teenage homeschoolers not only are out there, but can really thrive in that environment was really surprising to me. Yeah.

Ela Bass (03:54.515)
That is very fascinating. I'm curious why you defined it like this. You said that homeschooling fit your lifestyle in different ways, in different points, right? And like that was how you built it. Can you go into that a little bit? like, did you have a defined-ish approach? Was it just kind of like sort of guidelines? Did you direct a lot of your own education? What did it kind of look like growing up?

Mason Ember (04:22.688)
That's a good question. I do think it stems back to what I didn't like about school. It's always felt really silly to like complain about school within the context of preschool because for most people they're gonna hear that and really it's preschool, you know? But I do think it was a window into how I would have felt had I continued in a conventional school. So I went to a preschool called the Blue School in the city, which was run by one of the members of the Blue Man Group.

Ela Bass (04:35.158)
Mm-hmm.

Mason Ember (04:51.243)
Do know the Blue Man Group? It's like a, it's this really weird performance group. They like, they paint themselves blue and it's like, they drum, they do like performance. It's like a Broadway thing. Anyway, that's kind of an aside, but one of those guys started a school. It was obviously very creative, arts-focused, and even as a preschool. So it should have been a great fit for me, because I was always a creative kid and very curious. But I spent about two months there and what I found was that

Ela Bass (04:52.565)
I do not, no.

Ela Bass (05:00.311)
my gosh.

Mason Ember (05:21.299)
I just, I really wanted to invest a lot of time in certain things and I kind of knew what I was really passionate about and that passion could keep me somewhere for a really long time. And I didn't like being shuffled around and sort of spending an equal amount of time with everything. So I'll give you an example of like, I remember being at an art easel in like preschool, I was very, very little. And I was like finger painting or something and I was there for about five or 10 minutes.

And then the teacher said, all right, Mason, it's, you know, I know you're having fun with this, but it's time to go and do like sing along time in a group. And I remember being really mad because I just thought I'm having a good time with this. And I think I even argued with her. I probably wasn't very, you know, articulate, but I, remember being frustrated and then thinking like, I just want to spend the time I want to spend with this. and so then when my parents pulled me out of that school and decided to try homeschooling,

Ela Bass (06:07.447)
you

Mason Ember (06:20.619)
It wasn't even necessarily, they didn't know that this was gonna be the thing that I would do for my entire, you know, elementary, middle, high school. It was kind of year by year. And when I talk about my lifestyle and it fitting my lifestyle, it was sort of my parents evaluating how much the city and being in the city could teach me. And was I missing out on anything?

with school because ideally for me, I would always be self-directed. I would decide what I wanna do, how long I wanna spend with it, and then my parents would kind of fill in the blanks and make sure that I'm getting all the information I need to know. And it just worked out that every year they would check in and they would say, yeah, he's learning everything he needs to and he's getting the benefits of...

you know, my education was very much arts focused, not just in creation, but in experiencing art, you know, going to galleries and museums and seeing film screenings. And so your other question was about sort of the, maybe the through line. And I would say that that through line in my education was storytelling. You know, like I was always, I don't think I've ever stopped telling stories. Maybe it was one of the first,

Ela Bass (07:38.183)
Very fascinating.

Mason Ember (07:47.518)
things that really hooked me, I'd tell stories with my stuffed animals and then when I was older I would, I discovered that you could film your stories and make a profit. No, I wasn't thinking about that, but, so I started doing film making and you know, just playing around with stuff and I think that that was a really valuable way that I was taught about the world because I would make.

like little cooking shows and science shows. And I did like a news show at one point. It was just, you my iPhone. No way, seriously? Yes. yeah, that's great. Good, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's like stuff like that, you know, like little, like in our basement. It's fun, it's a lot of fun. And for me, it was the perfect way of like, you know, with that show, like makes a number weekly, right? It's like a.

Ela Bass (08:22.519)
I found that. I did find that on on YouTube.

Ela Bass (08:36.788)
It's awesome.

Ela Bass (08:44.491)
Mm-hmm.

Mason Ember (08:45.033)
It was like a late night comedy show. But in doing the research for that, you know, I was writing all the jokes. So I was reading the news every day and seeing what's going on, what's funny. You know, I would talk, I would interview my friends sometimes. So it's, I think that there's a real education to be had when you're passionate about something. And from the time that I was two years old and I had that passion about a painting or whatever it was to now when I'm passionate about making.

films, that's the thing that's always motivated me to like get out of bed and start learning, so to speak.

Ela Bass (09:22.197)
love this and really quickly, I kind of want to dive into your curiosity and your natural passion before I go into the film. Mostly because the parents that we that we work with all the time and most of parents that I've talked to, they want their kids to have a natural love of learning. They don't want to stamp out their natural curiosity. And it sounds like your parents did an amazing job with that. It sounds like I don't know how, but like they

found your passions very, very early. They nurtured them all the way through. They helped you to kind of lean into different projects that you could do. And it was really cool actually for me to stumble upon your show because it is your proof of work throughout the years. You have been pouring so much into becoming what is now a filmmaker. like,

other people might see your documentary and be like, wow, like this guy just came out of nowhere. but it's so cool to be able to go back and to actually see like all of the different things that you've done prior. And I think a lot of parents when they're on their journey, they're pouring into their kids and they're helping their kids like try and figure out the different projects to do, but no one can tell the future. And it's that, it's that fear that like, okay, right now he's doing these videos or right now he's very passionate about this thing. Like where is it going to take him?

And like the uncertainty and insecurity of that path, right? Like there is security in doing the path that everyone else does, right? And so it's quite fascinating because now, know, years later, we can see that there actually was a path moving forward, right? Like you were going somewhere, you weren't there yet, but like it seems like your parents have done an amazing job and probably you've done an amazing job in just committing to that journey and where you're going.

Mason Ember (11:17.351)
Yeah, I appreciate that first of all. And I would say, I think for parents, like, my experience is that you can just kind of follow a kid's passions and not really worry about where it's gonna take them. mean, because the amount of things I did that I haven't carried through to today, you know, there was a time when I thought like, you know, I'm gonna be a stage magician, you know? There was a time when I thought I'm gonna be a...

a chef, I'm gonna be a comedian, I'm gonna be a pilot, I'm gonna be whatever, you know? And we explored all of those things to different degrees. And yeah, at a certain point, I think my parents got this sort of overview and they thought storytelling. And so even today, when we're talking about, you know, what classes I wanna do or what the future looks like, they're not even talking about film necessarily, they're talking about stories. Because who knows what could happen, right?

Ela Bass (12:13.76)
Mm.

Mason Ember (12:16.408)
I could do this documentary and I could say, all right, I'm burnt out, you know? So then what? You know, like, and I think that yes, the conventional path that school offers is safe where you're just doing the same subjects, but especially in the modern era, there's risk with that too, you know? Like there's risk in not knowing what excites you and maybe it's not consistent.

but when people go to college and stuff, a lot of them are sort of like disoriented because they've never really explored what gets them really excited about the world. And so for me, think what my parents did, I think they did very well, was, you're right, sort of following my passions, letting me try weird things. My mom always said, I didn't really want you to become a stage magician.

Ela Bass (12:58.935)
Mm.

Mason Ember (13:15.046)
But the fact that I got to explore that for a year really taught me a lot about myself. And if I was just sort of being shuffled along with the standard curriculum, as it were, I don't think I would have ended up where I am, you know.

Ela Bass (13:30.475)
That's interesting. Side question, how much free time did you have growing up?

Mason Ember (13:36.259)
that's a good question. I guess I'll give a little bit of an annoying answer and say that for me, the line between what was free time and what was school time was almost non-existent. There was never a feeling of, school is in session, school is out of session. Every single thing I did was an opportunity to learn something.

I think a lot of people outside the homeschool world hear homeschooling and they think mom or dad is sitting around the kitchen table, you know, with a workbook with their kids. And for some people that's true, for more than others. For me, it was always like, I am going through the world. My parents were very proactive about always giving me activities, especially when I was younger, it was always like, let's go here, let's go here. you see this? Let's, you know, stay and watch this.

concert in the park or whatever. So it never felt like free time or not free time. Especially because my parents were also very proactive about saying, know, watching movies, reading books is part of your education, right? The amount of things I've learned from the movies I watched, the books I read, the TV shows, I think it's so much and

You don't want to have too much free time, too much time of just consumption, I think. But thoughtful and mindful consumption can be really powerful, especially because as young people, we have access to so much information these days. It's really good to get the experience of finding media that you enjoy, that excites you, that inspires you. So I don't know, I would answer that question by saying...

I can't really say how much free time I had. It was all sort of school.

Ela Bass (15:37.141)
That's quite fascinating. mean, I'm always intrigued by the amount of free time, especially with somebody that's quite, quite creative because especially in the way that we are so, you know, like geared to look at school, it's like a block, right? This is when you do your schoolwork, this is all your other time. And I find it really fascinating how homeschoolers, especially the type of homeschooler that you were, just see it differently. Like they didn't even experience it that way.

So yeah, thank you for going into that a little bit. I want to kind of move us along into your note to the editor. So when did you read this New York Times article and why did you decide to write something back to the editor?

Mason Ember (16:22.47)
I wish I could say it was me reading it and instantly thinking I have to speak my mind straight to the New York Times. It was actually my grandmother who sent me an email with the article and she said, I read this and I really think that your documentary provides a contrast to this sort of sweeping criticism of the homeschool world and you should consider writing a letter to the editor. So I read the article.

I was struck by, I mean, this guy obviously had a very difficult upbringing. His mom was crazy, you know, and the New York Times had given the title to this article and it was the homeschooled kids are not all right. And I thought that that was like finding a restaurant with health code violations, you know, and using it to define an entire city's food scene.

Ela Bass (17:20.822)
Mm-hmm.

Mason Ember (17:21.412)
You know, and they would never do that, right? Their food writer would never do that. And I thought, you know, that's just... Anyway, so I started writing the letter. I sent it in. I heard back in like two days. And it was great because, you know, it doubled as promotion for the film. But mostly I just really wanted to convey this idea of, you know, anybody can mess up education, you know, school messes it up.

Homeschoolers mess it up. The problem is not listening to the kids, you know, it's about the kids if they're not motivated by Testing then they shouldn't be tested as much If they are motivated by testing, they probably wouldn't do well with my life, which was very, you know exploratory and You know self self-guided right? So listen to the kid and put aside your own biases

as a parent, as an educator, and just focus on what the kid needs at whatever stage of their life. So that was sort of the idea with the letter.

Ela Bass (18:30.057)
What's fascinating to me is actually that like your perspective on this and this documentary, I'm like beyond excited to watch it. It offers a very unique perspective into homeschool because and not even just homeschool, but like the philosophy around, you know, what is our relationship to kids at this moment has, you know, as parents, what is our role? What is our responsibility from a kid? Because like

Mason Ember (18:39.374)
Thank you.

Ela Bass (18:58.601)
very fascinatingly, all of the, or all of at least the, the stuff that I've ever read is all written by parents is all written by, you know, very old adults that are like, you know, doing a lot of research and that's not a bad thing. but I find it very fascinating that like, you get to come in with a really, really fresh perspective and you get to say as a child, you know, as somebody that like people would look at and be like, okay, you know, like I,

I don't know if I'd necessarily, I think the, yeah, it's just very fascinating that like you get to come in with a really different perspective. The question that I have around that though is, as you've been exploring these different ways that people homeschool, are you finding differences in personality? like, you know, some parents will say like, okay, but my kid doesn't have this natural curiosity or like my kid isn't necessarily like this.

overt, they don't necessarily speak up all the time. And I'm curious what you'd say to that because like your, yeah, your viewpoint is so, so strikingly different.

Mason Ember (20:08.483)
Totally. I would say, so one of the movies that weirdly I sort of took inspiration from was The Breakfast Club. Have you seen The Breakfast Club? Yeah. You know, and I was struck by it. So I was very intentional in terms of the documentary and trying to find kids who on the surface seemed really, really different. And the way it worked out was I sort of had an academic, you know, a jock, an athlete, an artist who's quieter. Yeah.

Ela Bass (20:17.962)
Interesting.

Ela Bass (20:34.891)
That's so funny.

Mason Ember (20:37.206)
And then this like total like rebel does as he pleases, real sweetheart, but very much outside the mold, you know? And I don't know where I would fit into that. But so on the surface level, they're very different. They have different interests. They are motivated by different things. But at the same time, there is a through line, which is that they love learning.

For me, I would say that I think that learning is the most natural thing we do as humans, you know, like we needed it for survival at one point. We still do in some ways. And the problem with school is it can seem like kids are so different and they're so different in their needs because school has turned learning, unfortunately, into this really unnatural thing, you know, which is driven by kind of

arbitrary markers of success, but it's within this microcosm of school, which, you know, and I think that's where the big difference is. Some people can operate really well, sort of in the game of school, as it were, and then other people can't. But in the world of homeschooling, where you're just driven by your interests plus what you need to know, that sort of natural desire we all have to learn, whether it's

learning how to perfect your, you know, basketball game, or learning more about your favorite philosopher, or learning how to scan a picture and post it online, you know, like, I think that's the through line. So there are differences, but it's not as much as I thought originally.

Ela Bass (22:24.267)
That's interesting.

Ela Bass (22:32.791)
Hmm, now you have me thinking. It almost seems as though like homeschooling gets something right that school doesn't, which is that life is about micro goals and homeschool allows kids to actually dive into those micro goals, right? And like.

all of the skills that they learn along the way, all of the experiences that they have. Like for you, was like, okay, micro goal number one, you know, I'm gonna try this thing and then I'm gonna try this other thing. Okay, now I'm gonna try this other thing. I mean, even for like athletics, right? Like I'm gonna go really deep into basketball and giving a kid the ability to say, okay, like you can learn to become really good at basketball, right? There are some things that are obviously going to give you...

benefit like if you're taller or whatever but like you can learn almost anything in the world which is amazing and then also like giving them the time and space to do it so like instead of filling all their time with you know these other things that you are placing on them as goals right you give them the opportunity to pursue their own goals and then like almost live a life that is more aligned to who they are because they are just chasing these micro goals and micro goals and like kind of what you were saying before about filmmaking you don't know if this is like

you're going to be the thing that you do for the rest of your life, right? But like you're learning so many skills through it and you're gaining so many experiences that like the skill stack that you're building will be impactful to your life in the future, no matter what. And that's very fascinating.

Mason Ember (24:04.834)
I'm so glad that you said that last part because I think that that's really the crux of it is school and this is always a generalization like you know not every school not every school kid but but for the most part in my experience I think that school asks of kids very early on to filter out what they're good at versus what they're not good at you know so if you're a mathematical thinker you're gonna be put on a track of mathematical thinking

Ela Bass (24:15.733)
Yeah.

Mason Ember (24:34.497)
if you're a scientific thinker, an artistic thinker, et cetera, et cetera. You know, which just, you know, one, I think that that's how social clicks form in some ways. But two, I just think it narrows people's visions for what their future can be. And at this stage of where we're at as a society, I think that that's the last thing we should be doing. I think we should be opening up people's possibilities. Because as the world changes,

some opportunities are gonna go away, other opportunities are gonna open up. And so if we give people the, like if the number one takeaway of the school years is I can try anything, you know, I can learn anything, that's a really, really powerful skill that I think a lot of the homeschoolers have. I think public schoolers can get it too, for sure, but I think it's often in spite of the system rather than because of the system, yeah.

Ela Bass (25:33.719)
Very fascinating. So I want to kind of go into how these kids are building their education. And also, think, like something underlying that we definitely need to touch on is these are teenagers. But I think what came before they were teenagers, like how their parents structured their educations when they were younger, actually matters a lot, too, because it primes them to be the teenagers that they are. What can you give us insight into for like even just a mindset? Like how are how are parents helping?

teenagers to be successful homeschooled teenagers.

Mason Ember (26:08.255)
Yeah, that's interesting. I would say that it's, again, it's definitely different for every homeschooler. was different. I can speak to myself and then I can speak to some of the kids that I've been working with and getting to know. For myself, I think that my parents were very proactive in letting me fail sometimes, you know? If school is about...

finding the answers to problems quickly and moving on to the next problem. For me, homeschool, particularly that transition from middle to high school was about investing in projects long-term myself. And my parents provided me with guidance. And when I asked them for advice, they would provide it. But they would also let me like, no, you can write that email. You can write that letter. You can do this. You can do that.

but also socially too. Like, you know, they would give me insights into the friends I was making and stuff. But also, I mean, I remember in middle school, like, you know, organizing my first get together. So I entered middle school during the pandemic. Like in 2019, I remember thinking like, these are gonna be the best years of my life, you know, and then the pandemic happened. So there was kind of a two year lull and I was definitely behind socially at least just cause like,

it's hard to be social online school. So sort of later in my middle school life, as I was trying to reach out more, my parents really gave me lot of flexibility to like organize my own get togethers. And sometimes it goes well, sometimes it doesn't go well. Sometimes people don't show up. Sometimes there's an argument, whatever. And how do you manage that? I've noticed that with some of the kids I've been following as part of the documentary too.

Ela Bass (27:40.439)
true.

Mason Ember (28:05.408)
This one girl in particular who runs a book club, runs like museum groups where they go into the museums of the city and look at the artwork and exhibits. And much more, you know, has probably gone through the same things where, you know, sometimes it works out, sometimes, you know, you make enough food for everybody and sometimes you don't and people go home hungry. And I think that teaches you

As you're becoming a teenager, as you're getting more responsibility, I think that teaches you a lot more than giving everybody the answer. We're getting people used to finding the answer for themselves and when you get it wrong, trying again, rather than looking to the nearest adult for the answer, if that makes sense.

Ela Bass (28:55.509)
Yeah, in these kids' education, and I know like homeschooling varies by person, so I'm asking a lot of generalizations, but how involved do parents typically tend to be?

Mason Ember (29:10.203)
Yeah, that's a good question. I would say less so than a lot of people think maybe from the outside of the homeschool world. Again, like the kitchen table image isn't necessarily true. I remember one line that stuck with me that one of my participants said at one point was he said,

Maybe it shouldn't be called homeschool because I'm out for most of the day. Maybe this is a city thing too, to be honest with you. Like, you the fact that these kids know how to take the subway and buses and they get around on their own. In my experience, they're only, well, they're only being taught by their parents, like an hour a day at most. And they're probably with their parents.

three or four hours, and then most of the time, this is for teenagers, most of the time they're with other kids, teachers that they're outsourcing their education to, there are people, especially in New York City, who are college professors, who are former homeschool parents, current homeschool parents, who are knowledgeable in a certain subject and run classes that kids can go to, which is really cool.

Ela Bass (30:21.751)
That's cool.

Mason Ember (30:25.311)
So I think that that's what I would answer. Obviously, that's different for others. Certainly for the younger kids, I've spent a little bit of time during the documentary with kids who are 10, 12. The younger you get, the more time they're spending with their parents, their families in general. And it's obviously per kid, but yeah.

Ela Bass (30:49.555)
That's quite fascinating. You mentioned loosely like a mix and match view of education. So what are the different things that people are kind of putting together to build the education that they want?

Mason Ember (31:02.504)
Yeah, mean, it's, course, because I'm a little generic, I'm thinking of the buffet analogy. You're given all these options and you're choosing what works well. Generally, what can be seen in the buffet is you have homeschool co-ops, Like learning centers of kids who are all learning together, often it's parents who are teaching.

Ela Bass (31:09.238)
Yeah.

Mason Ember (31:31.102)
And I think that that's the closest you're gonna get to school as simulated in the homeschool community. For myself, I had never really done work with co-ops, because I think my parents figured like, well, if you wanted to simulate the school experience, just go to school. But it works for some people and that's awesome. It's definitely less rigid than school typically. Then you have democratic schools, which is another thing that people can choose to participate in.

Again, it's a group learning environment, but the kids decide what they want to learn. It's usually a majority rules process where the teachers will say, well, we can learn about this, you know, historical event, or we could, you know, do a research, whatever it is, and then the kids decide. Then there are museum-based classes. I do a lot of those. A lot of my friends do a lot of those where, you know, in New York, we have the Met, we have the Natural History Museum, we have MoMA.

And this woman who's a college professor at Hunter, which is the City College in New York, runs these classes. And we meet in the museum and we walk around and we use it as a way to learn about whether it be history or sociology, political science, so on and so forth. It's super cool. And then there are creative classes, right? There are, you know, we have homeschool music lessons, homeschool film lessons.

Ela Bass (32:46.059)
That is so cool.

Mason Ember (32:55.217)
But another thing I'll say is that a lot of the homeschoolers outsource to so-called after-school programs where they're not with other homeschoolers, but they're taking an acting class somewhere or a music class somewhere that's not a part of the homeschool world. You know, I've done a lot of work with pre-college programs, and many of my friends have as well, NYU and Hunter, community colleges. So with...

It really is a substantial buffet for sure and hopefully that answers your question but you know.

Ela Bass (33:30.027)
Yeah, that's perfect. And the buffet analogy is the perfect one. Why try to build something else if it's already working, you know?

Mason Ember (33:37.956)
Why try to, why try to, yeah, yeah. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Don't fix it. Yeah.

Ela Bass (33:40.567)
Exactly, exactly. I'm curious, how did you get plugged into the New York City community of homeschoolers? like, one of the hardest things is like finding all of the options, because homeschoolers kind of like, are sometimes just like under the fray, like they're doing their own things and you have to find them. So you came from Connecticut, you said, and then now you're in New York.

Mason Ember (34:07.783)
So that's actually reversed. So I grew up in New York City. was born, yeah, I was born in New York City. I lived for six years in New York. Then we moved to Connecticut. So before the pandemic, we moved to Connecticut. I would say that was the hardest period for me in terms of finding other homeschoolers. In the city, it was like, you know, I was very little. So it didn't really matter the...

Ela Bass (34:09.78)
Okay.

Mason Ember (34:31.866)
you know, community events I was going to, I would be fine to run around in Central Park. I would be fine to, you know, I'd be fine to do anything. As I got older and I started to understand what I liked and what I didn't like and the kind of people I wanted to spend time with, it was harder when we were in Connecticut because people were more spaced out and there was sort of an existing culture, particularly also when you leave the urban environment, homeschooling becomes a lot more religious, which is fine. I mean,

Like there are some great religious homeschool communities that I know of, but that's not for me. We do secular homeschooling. then I started commuting back into the city, because I'm only like 40 minutes away from New York. So I would go back into the city. My parents found this woman, Wendy Raver, on Facebook. So if you're in the New York City area, check her out. These great museum-based homeschool classes that sort of fit

what I wanted, which was something that felt academic and almost prestigious, because at a certain point I really wanted, you know, to have stuff on my transcript that would look good if I chose to apply to college someday. And that's sort of how I got into the New York homeschool community. And then the amazing part was one thing led to another. And soon enough, you know, you get invited to book club, you get invited to

I mean, now some of my friends and I are doing jujitsu every week, right? Which isn't anything to do with homeschooling, but we met through classes, discovered an interest, and now we're doing that. So it's sort of one thing leads to another. It's a very open world. You're right though, it's hard to find people for sure. One of the reasons I wanted to do the movie actually is just to like remind people, like there are programs out there. But I think most people do find community like on Facebook.

Ela Bass (36:02.763)
That's awesome.

Mason Ember (36:28.795)
through email lists, mailing lists. When I was younger, my mom did a lot of research through Mommy Poppins, which was like a site, just to find free events and stuff. So there's definitely resources out there. I do wish it would be more centralized.

Ela Bass (36:49.491)
Yeah, no, I mean, that is definitely the hardest part. But it's really cool to see that, like, when you find those pockets, how much the doors open. I'm curious, like, as you have explored your friends and their educations, what are some interesting things about the way that they do education? So you went into a bit of your story, and I don't want to give anything away from the documentary, but what, yeah, what has really been interesting to you about the way that your friends

Mason Ember (36:58.906)
For sure.

Ela Bass (37:19.391)
have built their education.

Mason Ember (37:21.048)
Mm-hmm. So it's been kind of weird for me because, you know, it's such a general term, homeschooling. Like, it feels weird to say, like, this is great for everybody. And, you I talk a lot about, like, how it really, it's about the kid. And I feel like most of my friends and most of the people I follow through the documentary are doing really well with their educations. But it's really interesting to just see how different

the philosophies can be. So we have everything from one of my friends who's a main participant in the film does kind of represent the closest you'll get to the classic around the kitchen table, worksheets, know, a lot of classes, a lot of requirements that the parents are saying, hey, maybe you don't want to learn this, but you have to, you know, because we want to leave as many doors open for you as possible. And

this girl is definitely college bound. Again, I don't wanna give anything away, but definitely wanted to pursue that path and I got to follow her as she pursued that path, which was really cool. So you have everything from that to, I'll give everybody a little tidbit, another guy, another friend of mine who I've been following, who is the exact opposite, who embodies, he said to me at one point, I have never had to do anything that I didn't wanna do in my entire

When I first heard that, I was like, whoa. Because that's scary to a lot of people. Because a lot of people say, you know, and I'm not necessarily disagreeing with them, you know, you do have to learn some things that are uncomfortable, right? But he started out at one of these democratic schools where the kids decide what they want to learn. And at one point there was a lesson that the kids did not vote on.

Ela Bass (38:48.193)
thing.

Mason Ember (39:16.973)
but the teachers decided that it was important for them to know. And his dad, you know, became aware of that and pulled him out of the school because they were that serious about the kid has to decide. And so, you know, some people are going to hear that and think that's pretty extreme. But then you look at, you know, how a kid like that can turn out. And sometimes they're really motivated by what they're interested in. And it leads them to do college classes or

music or writing. And so it's surprised me. I think it's going to surprise a lot of people. But you definitely do see that spectrum of like on the one end you have parents who are providing a lot more oversight. And then on the other hand, on the total opposite end of the spectrum, you have kids who are free to decide what they want to do and what they don't want to do up until the moment they graduate. Yeah.

Ela Bass (40:14.945)
That's interesting. Would you as a parent now having seen like so many different sides of the spectrum, would you take it kid by kid or would you decide it philosophically?

Mason Ember (40:24.321)
No, I would send my kids straight to public school. No, I'm kidding. Yeah, I would do kid by kid. I mean, the scary part about that, and I did want to talk about one other thing which sort of I'll tie into this, is it's daunting because what if you have a kid who seems to really want to go to public school? Like, I mean, some people probably want to do that. What if you have a kid who wants to do pre-college programs and that's expensive?

What if you have another kid who really just wants to play video games? You know, what do you do? It's hard enough when you have one kid, but if you have multiple especially, and they're different even from each other, even within a family unit, that's challenging. And I think that that speaks to where homeschooling is and can be very resource heavy. You know, it's hard to pay for all of that, to, you know,

I've spoken a lot about how valuable therapy was in my life. I consider it a big part of my education, you know, is just like understanding myself and my feelings. But that's costly, right? So I think ideally for me thinking about, you know, when I'm a parent and when other people in my generation are parents, I hope that at that point, the public school system is reformed to a place where

can be more open and it can accommodate more kids because ideally it's a great thing to be able to, you know, like I might be working in film, right? And I can't be sitting at home with my kids making sure that everything is perfect for each of their, you know, requests. So it'd be great to outsource that to the experts. Unfortunately, right now I think that the experts, though they may be trying their best, just can't accommodate all the ways that people really learn.

So it's a tricky question. I don't necessarily have a straightforward answer. Yeah.

Ela Bass (42:27.957)
I mean, it's definitely been stumbling a lot of people before you. no, that definitely makes sense. I think that is the hardest part is looking at the spectrum of available options and saying, okay, I am trying to do the best by my child. And also I'm trying to operate with the best information that I have also in the best geographic position that we are in, know, whatever options exist to us and don't is really important.

Mason Ember (42:31.224)
Sure, sure.

Mason Ember (42:56.396)
That's another thing is, I'm so with the documentary, it's, I'm following four main people and two of them are in the city and then two of them are in Connecticut. It's so different homeschooling in an urban environment versus a suburban and a rural environment. know, it could be the difference between hiking and being in the mat. So yeah, yeah, you're right.

Ela Bass (43:19.751)
No, it is quite different. Yeah. And I don't know. think, I think, I think listening to stories like the ones that you're telling are at least comforting, right? At least comforting. And especially the, the thing that gives me a lot of comfort is that like, you know, if a kid has a drive to learn, if they have a natural curiosity, right? Like that as a fundamental thing.

that you can teach to your kid, even if you get the method wrong a little bit, like they're going to eventually figure it out. They're not just going to stagnate and, you know, become a bum. Like they're going to figure it out. And I think so many parents are afraid that their kids are not going to figure it out if they give the wrong method, if they give the wrong approach. like, it's OK. Like there are so many schools that have given the wrong method and the kids figure it out, even without the

the deep, deep, deep desire to learn. We're very adaptable creatures and I think that is comforting in the least.

Mason Ember (44:28.503)
For sure, for sure. Well, you bring up a good point, which is that we can criticize public school, you know, day in and day out, but the vast majority of people in this country at least have gone to public school and have turned out pretty, pretty okay, you know? Like, could we nitpick and say, well, maybe they would have discovered something amazing, but you know, not everybody discovers something amazing and that's okay too. Really, I just want people to be happy with.

their life at any stage and I believe that you can still have fun riding a bike even with the training wheels. But yeah, you'll be fine. People will be fine. So, yeah.

Ela Bass (45:13.301)
I'm curious if you were ever nervous, I mean, before this documentary especially, if you were ever nervous about the idea of college.

Mason Ember (45:22.814)
like nervous about my ability to get into college.

Ela Bass (45:25.619)
into the one that you wanted to. Yeah.

Mason Ember (45:27.702)
So there was a time in my life, like for most of my homeschool life, was sort of, you know, smooth sailing, just like I was in this bubble of like nurturing-ness and creativity. But then at a certain point, some of the older people in my life who were less pro homeschooling started saying to me, you know, Mason, you're really gonna have to reevaluate what you're doing if you want to be able to go to college.

And I appreciated the feedback, but that provided me with a lot of worry. And I think it was unnecessary worry because it was coming from a more old fashioned mindset. And I realized something, which is that the world has changed so much. And I really even think that colleges aren't looking anymore for, you know, the perfect straight A

student who just followed the pipeline and did it perfectly. I mean, hats off to that person, but I really don't think that that's what these places are looking for. They're looking for people who have sort of taken the reins of whatever their situation was and who did follow their passions. You know, where at this point I can say with this film when it comes out, like, you know, who knows if it'll be like commercially successful or not, but I could apply to college and say, I did this.

You know, I spent a year of my life focused on this one thing. And so now I'm very comforted by that fact of they're looking for people with unique stories, with unique demands of a particular institution. And I think that a lot of homeschoolers can offer that. you know, I've seen a lot of the homeschoolers who I've followed, who I'm friends with get into their schools that they really wanted to go to.

But yes, to answer your question, there was a time that I was very nervous about college that I thought I got a, I never thought I would go to school because I knew I wouldn't like it. But there was a time when I really thought I have to change my life to be much more academic to be able to, you know, to do that. But I will say one more thing, which is during that period, I did a math class, which was like, we called it survey of high school math.

Mason Ember (47:53.014)
because I'll be honest and say, I didn't really touch math much for most of my life because I didn't like it. And one of the things I was worried about was, well, you you need math for the SAT. So I did this workbook program, which basically just covered all of high school math. I'm not gonna sit here and say I learned all of high school math, but I was struck by how

quickly I was able to pick up on the parts that I did understand. And I felt like we could compress the timeline a lot more than school. Like school, it's like you have an hour of math every single day for four years and beyond. But I was like, you could cover the important parts of the information, at least what you need to pass the test in a year. So I think that that sort of calmed my nerves about that.

Ela Bass (48:37.567)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (48:50.793)
And plus, I mean, if you had gotten a tutor, if this was like something that was quite important to you, you definitely could have gotten through that book. And I was actually reading Sal Khan from Khan Academy. He has a recent book and he calls learning math in school most of the time, like a method with holes. I forget what his exact thing is, but he's basically like, most students go through a class.

Mason Ember (48:57.629)
Right. Right.

Ela Bass (49:19.943)
and they don't fully master a topic and they don't fully understand it. And then they move on to the next topic and they don't fully understand it. And maybe they get the next topic and the next topic and the next topic, but because math and a lot of these things that we're learning, but especially math stack on top of each other, no matter how much you've learned, no matter which ones you aced, right? The ones that you didn't fully master and fully understand will always harm your ability to solve like the biggest problems.

because it is a system that builds on top of itself. And if you don't understand parts of the system, because, know, somebody moved too fast or maybe you were absent that day. Like there are so many pieces of it that, you know, like working actually being motivated as a kid saying, okay, I'm going to learn this and actually understand it and working with somebody else. Like you could probably get further faster. So that that's quite, quite,

quite helpful. I'm curious your advice to a kid or a parent that is in that position of like, let's say a kid has identified the fact that they do want to go to college or that they do have goals. Maybe a parent like your friend's parent is like, I just want to open the doors. Like, you may not choose it, you may not want it, but I just want to make sure that you have this available to you.

Mason Ember (50:28.391)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (50:34.781)
What is your advice to them to make this not something that becomes a worry or a constant fear, but just something that becomes a problem to solve and something that they can do together?

Mason Ember (50:46.315)
Definitely, I would say that community is so important. With that, I mean, we have parents in the homeschool community in the city who kind of act like college counselors for the ones that don't. So if you're a parent and you feel out of your depth, like, don't know about this world, like, be open about that, because that's not a problem. Like, that's not something to be ashamed of, because it's hard to be a homeschool parent and to

Ela Bass (50:57.281)
That's so cool.

Mason Ember (51:14.93)
be a principal and an English teacher and a PE teacher and all these things and a superintendent and a school board all as one person or two people. So like ask for help in the community. There are so many resources. I guess I could plug you guys like, know, but like, you know, open ed or there's a great organization called Aero, which is the alternative education resource organization, which is just

their whole purpose is it's a yearly conference where you can go and you can get resources from alternative schools, homeschool parents, et cetera. In terms of the college path specifically, like yeah, know, see if there people who are offering counseling services, see if there are schools in your area, like homeschool, like alternative schools in your area that will administer grades.

I know that that's some people's concern is like, well, my kid knows everything that they need to learn, but it doesn't say that anywhere. So there are ways to get that certification really quickly. My advice would be like, don't go straight to the GED. Take AP tests. I did Harvard extension.

for a time, which I loved, because that's for college credit. And it was just like an easy way. It's an online program, easy for me to, you know, learn what I needed to know, validate that on a transcript, and get some college credit. So definitely like as a parent, like, do the research and don't be afraid to ask for help. And there are so many like nationwide, even worldwide resources available that you can

sign up for right now that will give your kids the certification they need to pursue that path. But also, the second piece of, I guess, or thought I would provide is not every kid needs to go to college. And there shouldn't be any shame in that. If they're not college-bound or if they have a weird feeling about college, like,

Mason Ember (53:29.178)
Definitely you want to leave the option open up until the age when they can properly make that decision for themselves. But there is no shame in whether it be going to a trade school or getting an associate degree years after people typically go to college. Again, like the world is evolving and it's not a one size fits all solution. So listen to the kid, listen to the kid, listen to the kid. Yeah.

Ela Bass (53:54.453)
My last question for you, seems like with you especially, but also your friends that there's almost an innate natural love for the world. Like you actually do want to participate in it. You do want to be a part of it. You do want to experience it. Do you think that was like instilled upon you because of your homeschool career and journey? You did mention that there are lots of different types of homeschool and that

And that some kids, you know, definitely do not end up with that. like what aspects of your homeschool do you think led to that? Cause I think paired with a love of learning, just like a natural desire to participate is very important for future success. if those are the two things I could give my kid, is those two and only those two, because those two things will take them somewhere at least. yeah. What, what do you think is, is the thing inside of you, especially cause that's probably the best, the best.

Mason Ember (54:42.886)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (54:52.171)
that you can explain that brought that natural desire to participate.

Mason Ember (54:59.189)
I would say that I don't think anything in homeschooling actually gave me that. I just don't think anything in homeschooling took away from that, if that makes sense. Right? So, and maybe this ties into not where I started with the film, but where it left me. You know, I started the film, this documentary, because I was tired of answering the same questions that people had about homeschooling. know, can you read?

Ela Bass (55:08.404)
interesting.

Mason Ember (55:28.433)
Do you have friends, et cetera? But as I was working on it, I was left in this very different place of thinking about this natural, as you said, like love of the world that these kids have and seeing how motivated they are to just meet up in Central Park or at somebody's apartment and read or.

make art or collaborate on songs or play sports or whatever it is. And I was just left feeling, and it made it all feel sort of more high stakes in a weird way, was I was left with this feeling of...

That's taken away from a lot of people. I don't think it's intentional. I'm not one of these people who's like, you know, the school system is deliberate. It's not, but it's the side effect of being so general in our applications of everything, of knowledge, you know. And I'll say one more thing, which is that I think that...

Ela Bass (56:19.243)
Mm-hmm.

Mason Ember (56:41.41)
School teaches you how to complete tasks. Now we have tools that can complete tasks way quicker than we can. So there's sort of this natural, like, I don't want to call it an antagonistic force, but in some ways I think it's the antithesis of homeschooling. Came up as I was working on the project, which is AI in education. And that was sort of a good place to maybe connect to your question.

Because to me there's no better representation of the manifestation of how We haven't taught kids why they're learning we haven't given them that answer We've only told them do this then do that do it as quickly as possible And then you can be done then you can get out right, but should learning be the thing that we're trying to escape I don't blame somebody for using chat GPT to do their homework because

they've never been taught why it matters. Does it matter? And I think that with the developments I saw in the world and when I contrasted that with what I was seeing with making the project, I was struck by how whether you're college bound or whether you're not, these kids know what they wanna learn and they know why they're learning it. And when given the option,

to use a tool like, you know, chat GPT or something, I don't think they would take it and they haven't because there is that innate curiosity and excitement. And I think that if we can take that philosophy and implement it into so many aspects of society, the world would be a lot more exciting personally. So yeah.

Ela Bass (58:34.241)
That is absolutely amazing. And I bet it also hits close to home since the more that AI is able to do creative tasks as an example, like as a creative, you get to see the stark difference between something that a human created versus something that an AI created. And just like getting the task done versus like creating art is, they're two different things as well.

Mason Ember (58:44.336)
Mm-hmm.

Mason Ember (58:59.396)
I'll be totally honest with you and say I don't know how I would feel right now if I wasn't working on the documentary.

Ela Bass (59:07.178)
Interesting.

Mason Ember (59:08.12)
You know, like there's a part of me that thinks, I mean, I would be fine, but like there's a part of me that thinks I would be in a really different place. I would be thinking a lot more pessimistic-ly if I wasn't working on this project. If I didn't have this, you know, window into this world that is, it is a bubble. It's a, you know, but it's sort of a really exciting.

Ela Bass (59:27.093)
That makes sense.

Mason Ember (59:36.799)
world of just exploration and curiosity and it's in all of us. And I think that there are ways, especially the younger somebody is, that we can sort of expand on that natural desire to learn, to create things, to be a creative person. And if we teach that early in the school years, I think the future is going to be very bright, personally. So, yeah.

Well, this has been an absolutely phenomenal conversation and I can only imagine how many parents are going to just absolutely eat it up. We usually do. my gosh. Yes, exactly. I think that what you offer is a view that almost nobody ever gets to see, which is a very, very articulate young person who, you know, gets to shed a light on what is actually happening.

Mason Ember (01:00:13.56)
hope so.

not just like in the world, but also like in your own mind, like as a unique individual that has gone through this experience, like, and has come out the other end, 216, which is crazy. You have a lot of, yeah, you have a lot of skills and a lot of things that I think a lot of parents want to imbue in their own kids. So this was really amazing. It was really, I think just such an honor to talk to you. And I'm really excited to see the documentary in the future.
