# A 16-Year-Old Filmmaker Spent a Year Documenting Homeschoolers. Here's What He Found.

Ten teenagers sit in a New York apartment reading *Madame Bovary*. No parents. No teachers. No one telling them to stay on task. One of them organized the whole thing - the books, the food, the museum trips they take together afterward. Sometimes she makes enough dinner for everyone. Sometimes people go home hungry. She figures it out.

The person who showed me this scene is 16 years old.

Mason Ember is a filmmaker, a lifelong homeschooler, and the creator of a documentary called [*Against the Grade*](https://www.againstthegrade.com/), which follows four teenagers with radically different approaches to education. He's not reflecting on childhood from adulthood. He's living it right now - filming his subjects while simultaneously building his own education in real time. When the New York Times published a guest essay titled ["The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right,"](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html) Mason [wrote a response](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/letters/home-schooling-debate.html) that got published in their letters section. His message was simple: anybody can mess up education when they stop paying attention to what individual kids actually need.

We constantly ask parents and experts what children need. We rarely ask the kids.

## The Preschool Dropout

Mason went to preschool briefly at the Blue School in Manhattan - founded by a member of the Blue Man Group, arts-focused, as progressive as it gets. It should have been a perfect fit for a curious, creative kid. It lasted two months.

The way he tells it: he was at an art easel, finger painting, totally absorbed. A teacher told him it was time for group sing-along. He argued with her. He wanted to stay with the painting. He was maybe four years old.

His parents pulled him out and tried homeschooling. Not as a permanent ideology - as an experiment. Year by year, they checked in. Is he learning what he needs? Is this still working? Every year, the answer was yes.

What followed was a childhood that looks incoherent from the outside and makes total sense from the inside. Mason wanted to be a stage magician. Then a chef. Then a comedian. Then a pilot. Then a filmmaker. His parents let him chase each one. His mom told him later: "I didn't really want you to become a stage magician." But she let him explore it for a year anyway.

His parents did something subtle, though. They didn't see "film" as his through-line. They saw storytelling. Whether he was making cooking shows in the basement at eight, writing jokes for a late-night comedy show he produced, or creating a feature-length documentary at sixteen, the skill beneath the skill stayed consistent. So even today, when they talk about his future, they don't talk about film. They talk about stories.

Parents hear this and panic. A year on magic tricks? What if the detours never end?

But Mason's point is sharper than that. The conventional path has risks too. Kids who follow the standard track - same subjects, same markers, same benchmarks - sometimes get to college with no idea what excites them. They've been compliant for so long they've never explored. The safe path produces its own kind of disorientation.

## A City's Food Scene

When Mason's grandmother sent him [that New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html), his reaction was immediate. The piece used one person's terrible homeschool experience to indict the entire movement. Mason compared it to finding a restaurant with health code violations and using it to define a city's food scene. ([We had a similar reaction.](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling))

Schools mess up education. Homeschoolers mess up education. The constant is the same: when adults stop listening to what the kid in front of them actually needs, they fail that kid. Mason knows homeschoolers who struggled. He knows public schoolers who thrived. After a year of filming four teenagers with wildly different approaches, his conclusion is five words: be pro-kid, not pro-system.

His documentary subjects prove the point. One girl is academic and college-bound, with parents who require subjects even when she doesn't want to learn them. Another kid told Mason something that sounds alarming until you see the results: "I have never had to do anything that I didn't want to do in my entire life." That kid is taking college classes, pursuing music and writing, deeply engaged. His father pulled him out of a democratic school because teachers overrode a student vote on what to learn. That's how serious the family was about the child deciding. (If you're curious about that philosophy, we wrote a [full guide to unschooling](https://opened.co/blog/unschooling-a-guide-to-child-led-interest-driven-learning).)

Some kids need structure. Others need total freedom. Most need something in between. The system matters less than whether someone is paying attention.

## Homeschoolers Aren't at Home

The common fear about homeschooling is isolation. Mason found the opposite.

These teenagers ride the subway alone. They take classes from college professors. They're taught by their parents maybe an hour a day. The rest of the time, they're out - running book clubs, organizing museum trips, meeting for jiu-jitsu. One of his documentary subjects put it plainly: "Maybe it shouldn't be called homeschool because I'm out for most of the day."

Mason discovered this world because he lost it first. He grew up in New York City, then his family moved to Connecticut before the pandemic. The homeschool community there was thinner, more spread out, more religiously homogeneous. It didn't fit. So he started commuting forty minutes back into the city, where his mother found a woman named Wendy Raver running museum-based classes through Facebook. One thing led to another. Museum classes became book club invitations. Book clubs became friendships. Friendships became the documentary.

The *Madame Bovary* scene - ten teenagers, no adults, serious literary discussion - didn't come from nowhere. It came from a community that compounds when the right pieces connect. And it breaks when those pieces aren't available.

Mason is honest about this. When I asked him for his criticisms of homeschooling, he had two. First: it works better with money and urban density. The gap between what a well-resourced family in Manhattan can build and what a rural family can access is enormous. Second: because you choose your community, you can end up in a bubble. Public school forces kids together across backgrounds. Homeschoolers have to seek out diversity on purpose, and not enough of them do.

These aren't minor caveats. They're structural problems. But the fact that a 16-year-old can name them - while still advocating for the model he grew up in - says something about what this kind of education produces.

## No Bell Rings

I asked Mason how much free time he had growing up. He called it "an annoying answer." The line between free time and school time was almost non-existent.

"There was never a feeling of 'school is in session, school is out of session,'" he said. "Every single thing I did was an opportunity to learn something."

His parents reframed what counts as education. Movies, books, TV shows, concerts in the park - all of it counted. Not passive consumption. Thoughtful, directed consumption. Mason says the amount he's learned from the movies he watched and the books he read is enormous. But it required parents who were willing to say "look at this" and "what do you think about that" instead of handing him a worksheet at the kitchen table.

This is what most people miss about homeschooling. The kitchen table with workbooks is one version. Mason's version was a childhood where learning never had office hours and curiosity wasn't confined to a schedule.

Sixteen years into the experiment, here's what his parents produced: an articulate, self-directed teenager who wrote a letter to the New York Times and got published, who is making a feature-length documentary about education while still living his own, and who can tell you with equal confidence what works about homeschooling and what doesn't.

The question most parents ask is: should I homeschool? Mason's work suggests a better one. Am I paying attention to this specific kid in front of me?
