## Selected Title
A 16-Year-Old Homeschooler Responds to the New York Times (64 chars)

## Description
Most advice about homeschooling comes from parents, researchers, and experts. But what does a 16-year-old who's lived it - and documented it across four teenage lives - have to say? Turns out, we've been asking the wrong questions.

In this episode, Mason Ember shares what surprised him most about teenage homeschool communities, why his parents identified "storytelling" as his through-line instead of just "film," and his most pointed critique of homeschooling that even homeschoolers need to hear.

His philosophy: "Be pro-kid over pro-system." Whether you're homeschooling, considering it, or just curious about what education looks like when teens have more agency, Mason's perspective offers something you won't get from the usual experts - because he's the kid those experts are theorizing about.

## Cold Open Script (28 seconds)

MASON (00:12-00:20):
"One line that stuck with me that one of my participants said was, Maybe it shouldn't be called homeschool because I'm out for most of the day."

[SWOOSH]

MASON (00:00-00:12):
"There's something amazing to me about this visual of all these teenagers, like 10, sitting in this one girl's apartment and they're doing a book club. But there are no parents, there are no supervision, it's just these 10 kids. And they're reading Madame Bovary, you know, like the books that you would be reading in a school English class. But this is totally kid run."

[SWOOSH]

MASON (00:20-00:28):
"Colleges aren't looking anymore for the perfect straight A student who just followed the pipeline. They're looking for people who have taken the reins of whatever their situation was..."
