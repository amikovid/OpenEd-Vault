## TITLE 1: "What Happens to Kids Who Never Go to School?"

**Framework:** #5 - What Happens to (Entities) That Never (Activity)? (Score: 9461)

**Why it works:** Massive curiosity gap. Universalized - doesn't say "homeschool" so it pulls in anyone curious about education alternatives. Triggers curiosity + mild negativity (the implication that something could go wrong). Broadest possible audience.

**Principles:** Curiosity (open loop), Negativity (implied risk), Specificity (kids + school)

**Thumbnail Option A:**
- Visual: Mason in a NYC street scene, looking confident, maybe mid-conversation
- Text: "He dropped out at age 4"

**Thumbnail Option B:**
- Visual: Group of teenagers sitting in a circle in an apartment (book club scene vibe)
- Text: "No teachers. No grades."

**Thumbnail Option C:**
- Visual: Split - left side shows empty school desk, right side shows Mason behind a camera
- Text: "This is what happened"

## TITLE 2: "The REALITY of Homeschooling in 2026"

**Framework:** #6 - The REALITY of (Polarizing entity) in (Current year) (Score: 8465)

**Why it works:** "REALITY" implies what you've heard is wrong. Homeschooling is polarizing (NYT article proves this). Current year signals fresh information, not recycled takes. Directly counters the negative narrative.

**Principles:** Curiosity (what IS the reality?), Controversy (polarizing topic), Timeliness (2026), Authority (documentary filmmaker as witness)

**Thumbnail Option A:**
- Visual: Mason filming with a camera, NYC skyline behind him
- Text: "It's not what you think"

**Thumbnail Option B:**
- Visual: Screenshot/image of the NYT headline "The Homeschooled Kids Are Not All Right" with a red X through it
- Text: "Wrong."

**Thumbnail Option C:**
- Visual: Ela and Mason mid-conversation, candid podcast moment
- Text: "The NYT got it wrong"

## TITLE 3: "This 16-Year-Old Has Never Been to School"

**Framework:** Custom - Dial to 11 / Specificity + Contrast

**Why it works:** The age creates instant contrast - a 16-year-old should be in school. The viewer immediately asks "how is that possible?" and "what happened to him?" The answer (articulate filmmaker making a documentary) defies every expectation. No jargon, passes McDonald's Test instantly.

**Principles:** Curiosity (what happened to him?), Contrast (16 + never been to school), Specificity (exact age), Controversy (challenges assumptions)

**Thumbnail Option A:**
- Visual: Mason looking directly at camera, confident, maybe in a film editing setup
- Text: "Preschool dropout"

**Thumbnail Option B:**
- Visual: Mason behind a professional camera rig or on a film set
- Text: "And he's making a documentary"

**Thumbnail Option C:**
- Visual: Mason in a museum or gallery setting, looking engaged
- Text: "Zero days of school"

## TITLE 4: "He's 16 and Has Never Had to Do Anything He Didn't Want To"

**Framework:** Custom - Quote-based hook (Dial to 11)

**Why it works:** This is actually a quote from one of Mason's documentary participants, and it's the most provocative line in the entire interview. It triggers an immediate emotional reaction - most adults will think "that's insane" or "I wish that was me." Creates a strong open loop: what does that kid's life look like? Universalized - not specifically about homeschooling, pulls in anyone who's ever felt forced into something.

**Principles:** Curiosity (how is that possible?), Controversy (challenges every assumption about childhood), Desire (viewers wish they had this freedom), Contrast (16 + total freedom)

**Thumbnail Option A:**
- Visual: Teenager looking relaxed and happy, maybe reading in Central Park
- Text: "Is this even legal?"

**Thumbnail Option B:**
- Visual: Ela looking surprised/intrigued in the podcast setup
- Text: "Wait... WHAT?"

**Thumbnail Option C:**
- Visual: Teen on NYC subway or navigating the city independently
- Text: "No school. No rules. No problem."

## TITLE 5: "The New York Times Got Homeschooling Wrong"

**Framework:** Custom - Authority Challenge / Controversy

**Why it works:** Punching up at the NYT is inherently clickable. People who agree with the NYT will click to argue. People who disagree will click to feel validated. Mason's letter to the editor is a real event that adds credibility. Strong controversy trigger without being clickbait - it's literally what happened.

**Principles:** Controversy (challenging the paper of record), Authority (NYT as foil), Curiosity (what did they get wrong?), Timeliness (the article is recent/known)

**Thumbnail Option A:**
- Visual: The actual NYT article headline visible but blurred, Mason in foreground
- Text: "A 16-year-old responds"

**Thumbnail Option B:**
- Visual: Mason writing or at a desk, determined expression
- Text: "Dear New York Times..."

**Thumbnail Option C:**
- Visual: Side-by-side of NYT logo and Mason's face
- Text: "He wrote back"
