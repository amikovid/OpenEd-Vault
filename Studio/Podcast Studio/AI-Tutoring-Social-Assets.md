## Twitter/X Handles for Tagging

| Person | Handle | Role |
|--------|--------|------|
| Justin Skycak | @justinskycak | Math Academy, quoted extensively |
| Math Academy | @_MathAcademy_ | Platform featured |
| Claire Honeycutt | @HippyMomPhD | Neuroscientist, quoted |

## MAIN LAUNCH TWEETS (Pick One)

### #1 PICK: Contrarian Truth (Best for Justin RT)

> Most edtech sucks because it's free.
> 
> @justinskycak: "Free platforms need massive user bases to survive. Massive user bases mean serving casual users. To keep them coming back, platforms optimize for engagement - not learning."
> 
> The full honest assessment (with what actually works):
> opened.co/blog/ai-tutors-homeschool

**Why this one:** Provocative hook grabs attention. Justin's quote explains the counterintuitive claim. Easy for him to RT with a "+1" or comment.

---

### #2 PICK: Stat + Multi-Tag

> In 1984, Benjamin Bloom proved tutored students outperformed 98% of classroom peers.
> 
> 40 years later, we're finally cracking it.
> 
> @_MathAcademy_: 180 hours → 20-40
> @synthesisschool: "Kids thought it was a real person"
> 
> What works, what doesn't, and what @justinskycak gets right about edtech:
> opened.co/blog/ai-tutors-homeschool

**Why this one:** The 98% stat stops the scroll. Tags multiple orgs = more reach potential.

---

### #3 PICK: Expert Roundup (Gets Everyone)

> We asked the people actually building AI education what works:
> 
> @justinskycak (@_MathAcademy_): "The AI handles personalization. The teaching comes from human expertise."
> 
> @HippyMomPhD: "AI can't reason, create, or imagine. But for drilling facts? Game-changer."
> 
> @ben_m_somers: "The #1 predictor of retention was friendship. Not games. Not AI."
> 
> Full guide: opened.co/blog/ai-tutors-homeschool

**Why this one:** Tags 3 experts who all might share. Shows balanced reporting.

## WEEKLY SCHEDULE: Standalone Posts (One Per Day)

### MONDAY: Justin Skycak / Math Academy

**Angle:** The efficiency argument - how Math Academy compresses learning time

> @justinskycak built something most edtech companies can't:
> 
> A math platform that actually works.
> 
> @_MathAcademy_ compresses 180 classroom hours into 20-40 hours of focused practice.
> 
> His secret? "We don't use AI to generate explanations. Humans handcraft every lesson - then AI handles the personalization."
> 
> No flashy games. No dopamine tricks. Just rigorous math instruction that respects your kid's time.
> 
> We wrote up the full breakdown:
> opened.co/blog/ai-tutors-homeschool

### TUESDAY: Claire Honeycutt / The Neuroscience Angle

**Angle:** What a neuroscientist says about AI in education - where it helps, where it fails

> "From the outside, AI looks like it's thinking - but it's not."
> 
> @HippyMomPhD is a neuroscientist who homeschools her two daughters. Her husband works in AI.
> 
> She's optimistic about what AI tutors can do:
> → Endless patience
> → Personalized pacing
> → Let kids "run ahead in subjects they're gifted in"
> 
> But she draws a sharp line:
> 
> "AI can't reason, create, or imagine. It handles the 'knowing of things.' Education is something more."
> 
> The full breakdown on where AI tutoring works (and where it doesn't):

### WEDNESDAY: Ben Somers / The Friendship Insight

**Angle:** What Synthesis learned about retention - it's not the AI

> @ben_m_somers helped build Synthesis (the school that grew out of SpaceX).
> 
> His team spent $10 million building AI-powered learning games.
> 
> Then they ran retention analysis.
> 
> "The #1 predictor of retention was if the kid had a friend in their class. Not the games. Not the AI. Friendship - which is close to free."
> 
> He took that lesson seriously. His new company @reaborators isn't an AI tutor at all. It's a live community where homeschooled kids make real friends.
> 
> AI handles practice. Humans handle connection.
> 
> More on what actually works:
> opened.co/blog/ai-tutors-homeschool

### THURSDAY: Ray Ravaglia / The Limits of Self-Paced

**Angle:** The founder of Stanford Online High School on why connection beats personalization

> @RayRavaglia founded Stanford Online High School and spent decades studying how students learn through technology.
> 
> His conclusion is sobering:
> 
> "Even gifted students in asynchronous, self-paced courses had attrition rates north of 30%. With synchronous, community-based classes, it fell dramatically."
> 
> The problem isn't access to information. It's not even personalization.
> 
> "It's connection. It's mentorship. It's the irreplaceable experience of one human being caring whether another human being learns."
> 
> AI tutors won't replace that. But used right, they free you up for more of it.

### FRIDAY: The 2 Sigma Problem (Historical + Wrap-up)

**Angle:** The 40-year problem AI is finally starting to crack

> In 1984, Benjamin Bloom documented something educators have been chasing ever since:
> 
> Students with one-on-one tutoring outperformed 98% of their classroom peers.
> 
> He called it the "2 Sigma Problem."
> 
> The problem wasn't whether tutoring worked. The problem was economics. How do you hire a tutor for every child?
> 
> 40 years later, AI promises to crack it.
> 
> We talked to @justinskycak, @HippyMomPhD, @ben_m_somers, and @RayRavaglia about what's actually working.
>
