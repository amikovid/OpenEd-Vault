## Guest Info / Relevant Context


### Ela’s notes: 

0:00: All right, so my podcast with Amar Kumar, who is the CEO and founder of KaiPod Learning, was actually really amazing.
0:06: This one is a good one.
0:07: He talks a lot about like, what the trend is inside of microschools, what his belief for the future is, why he hopes that there are lots of microschools everywhere, and why he sees this, this like trend toward an, an amazing teacher.
0:23: That starts a small school that can actually give children individualized care and learning actually ends up turning out better but interestingly his approach is not that one teacher should teach every single subject, it's more so that teachers should be an orchestrator.
0:37: I need to cough so I'm gonna finish it in a second.

0:00: OK, and to finish, so I, I basically just asked him a lot of questions about like, you know, how he defines success at school, what he thinks that learning like the, the school, like a traditional school did wrong for students, parents, and educators and what the right approach is, How he personalizes education for his family and it was mostly a conversation about like traditional school versus his view of a micro-school approach, and yeah, I think it'll be really good for our families.
0:37: I think it will especially be really good for anybody that is interested in starting a microschool, because he talks a lot about like what they've seen through 5 years operating, the common challenges, the common, you know, the things that are working, things like that, so I hope you'll enjoy.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Bass (00:00.718)
Okay, Amar, I want to dive straight into the deep end with you. I want to ask you the question. So you got involved in micro schools actually during COVID. You started seeing that there was a trend that people really enjoyed the online aspect, personalized aspect of COVID schooling. However, they didn't have an in-person community. And so that's why you decided to dive headfirst into ChiPod. I would love to know, you know, it's been five now six years later. You know, what is your thought?

Amar Kumar (00:27.845)
Thank

Ela Bass (00:30.392)
coming out of that? Like, what have you seen that was really surprising to you and what have you seen that is confirming all the thoughts that you had back in 2020?

Amar Kumar (00:38.515)
Going right into it. I love it. Okay, I it's been five years almost exactly and it is incredible That we're still doing this, you know when you start a company, you don't know What it's gonna be like how long it's gonna last you just hope you get to your next goal and then you set another goal and then you sort of jump from goal to goal and I think so there's into your question one of the things that we had a hypothesis on and that's proven out

is that parents and families are going to start looking for alternatives at a scale that we've never seen before. And the data shows that pre-pandemic, was like 30 to 40 % of parents every year were looking for a new school every spring for the next fall. Now it's in the 70s. So we saw that. That was our hypothesis. In fact, the name ChiPod comes from this concept that it's the time to make a change. The second thing we felt is that teachers and educators are going to want a different career.

Ela Bass (01:24.13)
Mm-hmm. Wow.

Amar Kumar (01:37.925)
And we saw this some pre-pandemic that people were leaving the profession and the best people weren't going into the profession. And that trend has accelerated. The thing that really has surprised us that we did not expect is the rise in public funding for alternative schooling. And that means education savings accounts or vouchers or tax credits. think when I was starting Kipod, I had never heard of these things.

And two, they were only in a handful of states and only for small populations of kids. Could be special needs children or extremely low income children. They had this voucher concept. Since then, in the last less than five years now, we have seen an explosion of these education savings accounts and vouchers that allow families for the first time to afford an alternative. And that's good on its own, but from a business building perspective or a school building perspective.

Ela Bass (02:21.482)
Mm.

Amar Kumar (02:34.107)
In education, you've always had this choice of, you building schools or tools? And building schools was, I'm going to open a private school. Building tools was, going to make some software or curriculum. And so most people said, I'm going to build tools because all the money is in school districts. And there aren't that many families who can afford a private school. And now with this public funding for alternatives, it's become more possible to build a school that families can afford.

And so now it creates this incredible level of competition, this incredible diversity of models. And I think it is the most exciting time to be in education.

Ela Bass (03:16.952)
This is so fascinating. I've actually also seen this and what is fascinating to me about like this movement inside of education is that previously, prior to COVID, prior to the advent of like lots of technology and lots of options, you had homeschooling for mostly values-based reasons and mostly ideological slash curriculum differences.

Amar Kumar (03:39.123)
Mmm.

Ela Bass (03:44.052)
Now you're seeing a lot of homeschooling slash alternative schooling for flexibility purposes. Like parents need a different option, whether it be their kid is sick, whether it's that their kid has some sort of a condition, you know, like so many different things that are pointing to this like more personalized model. And I know that you're very interested in the personalized type of education. Can you give a little bit of background? know that your story actually points to the fact that you've

Personally seen personalized learning work very well for kids. Can you give a little background into that?

Amar Kumar (04:19.495)
Yeah, of course. every teacher, I was a teacher and every teacher knows that that traditional model of having to stand in front of a class and deliver the same lesson isn't the most effective thing to do. It might be the most efficient thing to do, which is why teachers do it. But we know that the most effective thing to do is get down to a small group of kids as possible. One kid at a time, two or three kids at a time. And when I was a teacher, I

discovered this challenge of efficiency versus effectiveness and I did well. So in my normal class period, I would teach the lesson plan, but then after school, even in the evenings, I would bring small groups of kids together to deliver a more personalized approach. And yeah, no surprise. It worked really well. Those kids loved learning. They were thriving. They were getting ahead, but it was totally not scalable.

And so for me, like that was the, it really came to light every single day of how important this needs to be. And it's ultimately why I left teaching because I was just like, I'm doing this thing during the school day that is clearly not effective. Why am I doing that? I got to go find a different way. And that's what got me on this path towards more personalized forms of learning. Started with online education and then led to ChiPod because I just think there's more and more need for it.

as the needs of students increase, as the complexity of what we have to know to succeed in life increases, it's no wonder parents are saying, I gotta do it myself.

Ela Bass (05:51.224)
That's so fascinating. So what are you seeing inside of teachers specifically and then in yourself? Like as you have stepped out into this world of alternative education, into this world of honestly entrepreneurship, which is very American, but it's also very difficult. What are you seeing are some common challenges inside of teachers for building and starting a micro school?

Amar Kumar (06:14.707)
We need a lot of teachers who are micro school curious. They say, I've heard about this concept or I've seen one or one of my friends started one and I love it. This is everything I want out of teaching. But I don't know how I would start one. That's like a knowledge gap issue. I don't know if I could do it. That's a confidence issue. And then I don't want to do it alone. That's a community issue.

Ela Bass (06:38.178)
Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (06:43.463)
So we see these challenges as knowledge gap, the confidence, the lack of community. It holds a lot of teachers back. And if you think about the best teacher you had when you were in middle school or high school, everyone has that one person, right? If they started their own school and you had a chance to be around that person and absorb their humanity, their knowledge, you would be so happy. And so we want these goats, right? These best teachers.

to start their own schools and more kids to really be around these best people. But we have to then remove those barriers. We have to show them the what, we have to build their confidence that they can do it. And we have to give them the community that they can do it with other people and they're not gonna be on an island on their own. And so what ChiPod now does, we've sort of moved into that space of entrepreneurial ecosystem building, like really finding the highest caliber teachers, giving them all those supports.

so that their school vision can come to life.

Ela Bass (07:45.102)
Can you go into that a little bit? just for people that are not familiar with what Kipod does, can you explain that as well? like, yeah, explain that please.

Amar Kumar (07:53.157)
We are a micro school network. So that means lots of things, but essentially we are a collection of micro schools around the country. I think we're in 20 something States now, and we have almost 80 schools across the country. Some of those schools are started by Kipod. So it'll be our name on the building, my name on the lease, know, like they're corporate owned and operated micro schools. But the majority of those schools are what are called catalyst partner schools. So these are independent educators who took that leap.

to start their own school. We took them through a bootcamp to help them figure out all the ins and outs of it. Now we support them and provide oversight over that school as they're operating it. So you can look at it as a network of schools that all have a shared philosophy, aligned visions, but they might be serving totally different groups of kids. So it's not necessarily a top-down franchise. It's a little bit more bottoms up, but with a lot of shared infrastructure.

Ela Bass (08:48.332)
Yeah, and something that I want to get into in this conversation is just how difficult it is to start a micro school and kind of like the problem solving aspect of it from your perspective, because I've seen a lot of micro schools throughout the years begin, catch traction in the beginning and then kind of fizzle out a little bit. I've also seen different things where like as a business, right, you want to try and scale because more students equals more revenue, etc. But also it is encroaching on the fact that

you wanted to start something that had small classes and that had this like one-on-one personalized approach. So can you explain a little bit of what you're seeing in terms of the best micro schools, like the micro schools that are consistently performing well and also they're going to last.

Amar Kumar (09:37.075)
Great question. So we look at literally hundreds of founders who are going through this process. And we see that the ones who launch and then sustain post-launch have very common characteristics. Number one is quality and academics is at the heart. That's not surprising because then they're delivering a really strong learner experience that creates retention. Number two, they're very intentional about involving families in the model.

Ela Bass (10:00.397)
Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (10:06.545)
and that creates loyalty and word of mouth. And then number three is they're very intentional about financial sustainability. They know how important it is to charge the right amount, make sure their enrollments are at their targets, to make sure they're not overspending, to make sure they're not relying on grants just to make ends meet, to make sure they're paying themselves so that it's a career for them. So they're very intentional about that third part. And I'm spending a lot of time on this third part.

Because sometimes educators get into this business because they say, I want to do the right thing and my heart is there, but they don't think about the business side of it. And that is so critical because if you don't think about that side of it, you're not going to be able to sustain past a few months. You will fizzle out, like you said. So in our program, we put a ton of support around, you know, forming your business or nonprofit, incorporating legally, building a financial model, ensuring you're licensed properly.

Ela Bass (10:43.49)
Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (11:02.291)
Because we meet founders who are just like, don't tell anyone about us. We don't want a regulator to know. And I was like, why not? If you're not going to market yourself, how are families going to discover you? So we really want to bring this out of the shadows and say, these are legitimate enterprises that are delivering really high quality education and their ongoing concerns, which means they will continue to thrive as a business. And that's something that will professionalize the whole sector.

Ela Bass (11:24.024)
So.

That's quite interesting and I'm curious to go into that a little bit because I've also kind of experienced that whole like, ooh, be quiet a little bit, we don't want regulators to know. And that's very much a, I don't know, for a long time homeschooling was flying under the radar and alternative was flying under the radar. And I think what's fascinating about where we are in education is there's this whole idea that in the past it was the old and the new fight each other to see what wins out, but in...

Amar Kumar (11:41.779)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (11:56.788)
In this world, what technology allows us to do is to create a second path that offers new options. And so people will be adapting on both sides, but then there will be this like new alternative, very interesting thing that like nobody saw coming. And that's very, very much the case with microschools. when teachers are starting microschools, most of the time they're really proficient in one thing, but now they're teaching a whole host of subjects. Can you go into that?

Amar Kumar (12:22.963)
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It's a very common objection in terms of teachers getting into it saying, how will I ever do this? And part of our training, or you can call it retraining, is to say, you don't have to be the teacher for everything. You can be an educator. And an educator doesn't have sole responsibility to teach a topic. They're there to ensure that the child is getting educated.

And so what that means is you can rely on all my resources or a digital curriculum to do the core instruction. And then you as a learning coach or a learning guide can provide support. So if someone's opening a high school for microschools or a high school, microschool, you know, they're not going to be proficient in all the subjects. It's very unlikely to find an educator who is comfortable with all the subjects. So we help those educators find.

online curricula that those kids can use in person at their school to supplement the teacher's skill sets. And that all of a sudden unlocks a whole new world for them to say, I don't feel like I'm the only one who can teach. And that means I can show up for kids in a different way. And that's just so exciting. Cheers.

Ela Bass (13:30.306)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (13:34.973)
Hmm. This is fascinating. So in a way, it's almost like you have an orchestrator of a child's education, right? And for homeschoolers, that's often the mom, right? And a mom will say, OK, I'm going to orchestrate the education of each of my individual children. Oftentimes, that means that she's testing out different curricula. She is putting them into different types of extracurriculars and different online classes and a very mix and match approach. And so what you are saying is,

you see a world where teachers are the same, where teachers can be the orchestrators for the students in their classroom.

Amar Kumar (14:11.047)
Yeah, they're the orchestrators. They're not the ones who are playing the instruments who are telling kids exactly how to the instrument every day. They're ensuring that the symphony is playing. And when you go to a great micro school that operates like this, it will feel like a symphony. And I don't use that lightly. Like you will see that, okay, like nine o'clock is when academics start. So like 8.58, everything's chaos. Everyone's having fun. They're chatting. Nine o'clock, kids just start to get back to their nest because they know time is ready for academics.

Ela Bass (14:24.64)
Interesting.

Amar Kumar (14:37.747)
It just happens without the teacher having to do like a clap or like, you know, raise your hand if you can hear me kind of games. The students know what to expect. And so a healthy micro school operates on its own little rhythm of those, you know, 15 kids and that educator, they have their own rhythm that they have discovered because it's just them versus 30 kids are filtering through my classroom every 45 minutes. There's no rhythm there. That's just like, that's just treading water. Whereas in the micro school, you have a chance to establish.

Ela Bass (14:59.342)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (15:04.045)
Yeah.

Amar Kumar (15:07.399)
your rhythm, to swim the way you want to swim. And that for educators is incredible. For kids, it's incredibly empowering. And for parents, it's confidence building. Like, this is what I've always thought education should be like, and now it exists. We have so many parents who say, I wish this existed when I was a kid, because that's what should be.

Ela Bass (15:14.126)
Mm.

Ela Bass (15:24.537)
my gosh, yeah. So are most kids using the same curricula in a micro school or no?

Amar Kumar (15:31.205)
It depends on the educator who started the school, what their vision is. What we tend to see is on the younger side, so like if it's a micro school for elementary age kids, there's more consistency. So the curricula might be the same because you don't want young, like a kindergartner to be doing something totally different than another kindergartner because they may not know how to read, et cetera. So the younger side, it's usually one curriculum that everyone's using. When you get into middle school and high school, choices open up.

Those kids can be more independent, they can be more self-sufficient, and their needs are starting to widen. You may have a high schooler who's super gifted and wants to do college-level algebra, and you might have a high schooler who's doing any great algebra. To give them the exact same piece of curriculum is not a good idea. So allowing them each to choose their own path and learn at their pace,

with the human in the room, the adult in the room providing coaching, now all of a sudden opens up this intense level of personalization.

Ela Bass (16:35.394)
That's fascinating. What's the difference in the ChiPod model, but also in the way that you've seen micro schools flourish between say an educator in these micro schools and like a guide say in a actin model or something like that?

Amar Kumar (16:50.771)
Yeah, I would say it's on a spectrum, very similar. In an active model, the students are very self-directed. They know what the expectations are. They have the quests. And the guide is just there to make sure you're unblocking the kids. You're not there to tell the kids what to do. You're unblocking them. And in a really healthy micro school, that's often the role of the educator. In more micro schools, you're setting the tone, the culture, so you're a little bit more active. But eventually, the hope is that the children are driving.

Ela Bass (17:06.967)
Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (17:20.859)
And that in great microservices you see that happen.

Ela Bass (17:23.788)
That's really fascinating. I'm curious your perspective on this. In your opinion, should anything be standardized in the micro school approach?

Amar Kumar (17:34.533)
I really want to say no, but let me think.

I would say, I mean, we have this set of principles that we talk about guiding principles for our network, which include things like small sizes, family involvement and engagement, educator training. Like those are principles. You could say those are kind of standardized, but even there, there's a lot of flexibility. I think my answer is no, nothing must be standardized because it needs to be so responsive to the child's needs.

Ela Bass (17:51.149)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (18:00.323)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (18:08.494)
Mm.

Amar Kumar (18:09.253)
And we even see that in some of the ones we run, you may have 12 kids to an educator. And even within that one little pod, the educator is supporting each of those 12 kids in a very different way. And that is the beauty of what an educator is now able to do because they only have 12 kids versus before. They had 25 kids going through their classroom every 45 minutes. So you have the chance to reject standardization.

Ela Bass (18:23.054)
Mm.

Amar Kumar (18:38.567)
You have the chance to say you can eat lunch whenever you want. You can go get a snack whenever you want. You can go to the bathroom whenever you want. Because it's just us. It's not like this complex web of hallways and bells and bus schedules and cafeteria menus. It's just us. And we can figure it out together. And that's the beauty of the community.

Ela Bass (18:52.61)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (18:59.234)
That's quite fascinating. So when you think about the future of micro schools, right? The best ones are going to attract the most people, of course. It sounds like you have this desire to stay small, but let's say that like someone keeps on attracting people. have, you know, hundreds of people knocking at their door. Wouldn't it then just become a school instead of like a micro school? Or what does that look like?

Amar Kumar (19:20.051)
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's sort of like a paradox at the heart of this movement, right? The best schools will attract a lot of families, and I love that, but it doesn't need to be a paradox. So we see two pathways. We recommend two pathways. One is if the founder's desire is to make a larger, let's just call it like a traditional private school. That's great. We'll support them in that. What we force them, we're encouraging them strongly is how do you keep your culture? How do you keep that small size feel?

Ela Bass (19:25.719)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (19:47.19)
Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (19:49.331)
but with a larger group of kids in one building. The second pathway, which I often sort of encourage, is stay small in one campus, but open multiple campuses. Have multiple campuses where then there's its own community, its own leaders, its own group of kids. That can be more family-friendly because then you have schools closer to the families. It's also more embedded in the community because if you have a school of 30, 40 kids, you can...

Ela Bass (19:51.917)
Hmm.

Amar Kumar (20:18.515)
locate in a smaller retail footprint versus if you have 300 kids, you just need a bigger campus. So you just, you're able to do more things if you have more small campuses and you know, all the business people say that's inefficient economies of scale, blah, blah, blah. But I think when you're talking about education, I'm willing to accept some trade-offs when it comes to economies of scale in order to deliver a really high quality.

Ela Bass (20:31.158)
Hmm.

Amar Kumar (20:47.642)
small experience.

Ela Bass (20:49.73)
That's quite fascinating. How would you define success as a school then?

Amar Kumar (20:56.431)
I mean, it's the three audiences that we talk about. For students, it's obviously academic success, but also a love of learning and readiness for the future. And love of learning is something we can measure through great norm reference student surveys. For the parents, it's confidence in their child's learning, it's satisfaction, it's word of mouth, retention, we measure those things. Public schools tend to have really high retention rates.

And elite private schools have really high retention rates, but everything in between, there's a lot of churn. And so when we see that our micro schools have much higher retention than the average, we feel good about that because we can see that parents like it. And then the third audience is the educators who work or start these schools. We want to see immense career satisfaction to say, you are so thrilled that you took this leap because that's what's going to encourage the next million educators to do it.

Ela Bass (21:28.705)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (21:34.882)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (21:51.855)
Okay, let's go into those three personas, would you, per se. So the student, the parent, and the teacher. What are the problems that they are currently facing inside of the normal school system and the normal way that we've set up education? through what you have been building inside of KyPod, what do you think they most need?

Amar Kumar (22:22.257)
I think for students, it's learning is something that is being done to them. And this is often people talk about the difference between learning and education. Learning is a natural process that is always happening, right? No matter what a child is doing, whether it's a video game, mowing the lawn, or going to school, they're learning something. Education is a formal process, and we have many of those two things too far apart. So for a child, the process of education is painful, but learning is exciting.

Ela Bass (22:48.098)
Hmm.

Amar Kumar (22:52.315)
I fundamentally believe all humans just love learning, but we can make the process of education painful. So that's, think, what kids need is to rediscover the love of learning. And school is one vehicle to do that. And that includes autonomy, agency over what they're learning, control over the pace, and then also making sure that the learnings are dialed into the right level of difficulty, right? I use this example of going to the gym.

If I went to the gym and my personal trainer said, I've got to lift, you know, 100 pounds for my bicep curls, I would not go back. I would hate those sessions. But it convinced me if he said, I've got to lift a five pound bicep curl, I would say, this is so boring. I'm not building any muscle and I won't tell you what my actual weight is. But you know, he or she needs to get dial into my right level of difficulty so that the pain I'm experiencing is actually joyful.

and it's building muscles, right? And the brain is a muscle. So the academic pain that we experience should feel joyful and build muscle. I think for parents, there's this massive disconnection they feel. I am a public school parent and a private school parent. I two kids. And I can tell you, I feel so disconnected from my daughter's public school, but I feel so connected to my son's private school. And they're two different kids. have different needs, which is why they're in those environments.

But isn't it a shame that this public school, which is the anchor of my community, and it's a beautiful school, wonderful educators, but they're so busy that they don't have a way to involve us. And the only way I can get involved is to join the PTA and donate money and do bake sales. But I actually want to feel connected to our classroom. I want to feel connected to the work they're doing and even shape it in my way if I can, which is just not possible. And so parents, think, have sort of

Ela Bass (24:47.086)
Mm.

Amar Kumar (24:49.235)
Resign themselves to I send my child there and then I hope the best happens whereas I think we all deserve more of a say and a lot of the trend towards homeschooling is parents saying I deserve more of a say in my child's learning and I bet I can do it better Right and then so that's I think for parents is that lack of connection and for educators, it's the lack of purpose

Ela Bass (24:54.851)
Yeah.

Amar Kumar (25:19.291)
And I say this in a slightly controversial way. Educators get into the field because they want to have an impact. No one does it to make money, right? No one gets into teaching to make money. They do it because they feel connected to the kids and they want to have an impact. That's the sense of purpose. But he talked to anyone who's been teaching for more than a few years. They talk differently. They say, I don't feel like I'm having the impact I should. I don't feel connected as much as I should.

And it has to do with that phenomenon I talked about earlier where you just know that the way you're teaching isn't the most effective. So you're not making a difference on kids' lives as you should be. And when we talk to teachers who have decided to leave the classroom, the number one reason is I'm not making a difference. Number one reason by far. I'm not making a difference and I know I can do it better, but no one lets me do that.

Ela Bass (26:07.854)
Mm.

Amar Kumar (26:15.013)
And so when we say you can build your own school and do it the way you feel is right, and then parents vote with their feet, that's so exciting. That's exactly what they want more of.

Ela Bass (26:29.388)
Why do so many educators feel stuck? Is it that they don't know alternatives exist? Is it that like, what would you say?

Amar Kumar (26:36.499)
I think it's fear, but more it's awareness. Yeah, I wrote a blog about this on Forbes a few months ago, which is the hidden costs of teachers who just stay. The satisfaction rates in today's public education pool is very low. And the, I think it was an action, the NEA, one of the largest teachers in the US did a survey. Their own survey said 55 % of teachers want to leave in the next five years. Their own survey, right? So teachers are just dissatisfied.

Ela Bass (27:00.525)
well.

Amar Kumar (27:05.266)
And there's a cost to that every single morning when a kindergartner walks into the classroom and says, I know this adult does not want to be here.

Right? Or the teacher's heart isn't in the lesson plan that teaches the Pythagorean Theorem today. Right? There's a cost to that. And so we want to build awareness of options that these teachers have because they deserve to find a career they love. And when they find a career they love, which hopefully is in education, but it may not be, if it is in education and they're building a school, then the families will flock to it. Because the most attractive thing for a parent is an educator.

Ela Bass (27:31.341)
Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (27:44.915)
who's excited about your child.

Right? If, when a teacher talks to me about my son and says how wonderful he is and here's what they're working on and here's the challenges he has and what their plan is, it's like, wow, you, you might know him better than I do in some ways. That is so magnetic. When I hear that, I just want to stay on the zoom or go visit that teacher all the time. And so we want more of that. And these teachers who are starting their own schools, they are that magnet to parents.

Ela Bass (28:00.098)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (28:17.454)
Yeah, I love that. I'm curious. Do you personalize your own kids education? So inside of OpenEd, we have a variety of different of different teachers and leaders that have chosen different approaches for their kids based on their needs. And something that's really been amazing is watching how if you come into education with this belief that you can personalize it, no matter what approach you take, no matter what approach you pick.

you find the ways that you can personalize through it. So you mentioned that you have one kid in private school, one kid in public school. How are you personalizing through that?

Amar Kumar (28:56.595)
Yeah, I mean, think it's my belief is similar to yours that every parent one should make an active decision on what they're doing. It could be public, it could be private, it could be homeschool, but it needs to be an active decision. And then number two, the parent needs to still have their hands on the steering wheel. Those are my two beliefs. So in my case, for one child, we actively decided to choose the local public school because of her social skills, her academic needs, I was like, this is going be a great school.

And we actively chose to live in the school district because of the grade schools. So we decided public, right? Because it's right for her. And, but the second part, we are still personalizing. So we still do math and reading and science experiments and language and music. We still do a whole host of things outside of the traditional school, because we just see where she might be ahead of the curve on one subject. So that means during the day, she's not getting enough

some reps to build that muscle. So we will do that at home.

Ela Bass (30:02.008)
Have you seen that it has changed her perspective on her own education maybe compared to her peers? Okay, fair.

Amar Kumar (30:07.603)
I think she's probably too young to know that. She's in first grade. Probably a little too young. But I have talked to her in the past about obviously what I do at ChiPod and schools. And she says, one day I want to go to one of your schools. And she obviously doesn't know what that means yet. yeah, I would love, when she gets a little bit older, to open a micro school where she and maybe some friends are really able to be supported where they are. And so that's in the cards.

Ela Bass (30:16.707)
Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (30:36.753)
We actively chose this local public school to balance our work commitments and what she needs, and we think that's the right fit. But we're going to re-evaluate every single year, because that's what parents should be doing.

Ela Bass (30:48.45)
That's really cool. I know part of your story is that you actually came from India and you came to the US for education actually for your own education. But when you came to America you were surprised how not different it was from India. Now like looking back on that and trying to think about how you're going to personalize and build your children's own education. How do you like want to build it? What do you think are the components of it actually very very robust?

Amar Kumar (30:56.113)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (31:18.38)
good education.

Amar Kumar (31:23.293)
Well, that's a question. I mean, I came to the US one, three decades ago. So things have changed a lot. I think one component of a great education is relevance. So like, you learning things that are important and you understand why they're important? Number two is personalization. Like you get to choose what you work on at your pace that you're working on it. And I think number three is community. You're doing it with a

Ela Bass (31:28.619)
for sure.

Ela Bass (31:35.618)
Yeah.

Amar Kumar (31:51.283)
group of peers and adults who are just as committed to those things as you are. And I think the things that I found, I was 10 years old, the things that I found were the same right now, the relevance was just as blah. I don't know why I'm learning this thing. Like, why do I need to know the date of the Magna Carta, whatever, right? Like those facts, it was just fact memorization and knowledge is important. I understand that we need to memorize certain things, but I just never felt connected to that education.

Ela Bass (31:56.045)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (32:10.494)
Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (32:21.809)
And then I personalization was zero, right? Like I was just told what to do. And when I came to the U.S., I was academically very ahead, but I was just put in a standard fifth grade classroom. And I was just bored out of my mind because I was like, I know all of this stuff. Why am I doing this again? So there was no personalization for me. And then of course, by high school, I was behind because I just didn't do the work. But I think that if I had felt more connected to I get to choose what I work on and move at my pace.

I just think I would have been much further ahead. Learning would have been more joyful.

Ela Bass (32:56.076)
Yeah, I have a very similar experience, but not obviously coming from India, but just throughout education, like just kind of like losing your interest into it. You do what people tell you to do enough until you get to the point where you're like, OK, well, why am I doing that or trying as hard? And and yeah, it's quite fascinating. Like where would things be different if I had never lost that interest in that almost like

sense of self inside of education. Like what am I personally interested in? And the fact that that's never asked or like very infrequently asked. Something else. So I actually did a podcast recently with a kid. He's 16 years old and he's creating a documentary of homeschoolers. Very, very cool. Very cool experience. But he was saying that something that's been really fascinating for him is that

He, hold on, sorry, I lost my train of thought. I have no idea where I was going with that. what I was also curious about is when you started in 2020 and you were trying to figure out like, okay, this is very interesting that people are hopping onto pods and micro schools.

When did you realize that it wasn't just like a passing thing? Like, okay, this isn't just like something that is like a thing that's a blip because of COVID. Like this is actually changing and maybe speeding up something that was already going to happen.

Amar Kumar (34:33.843)
Certainly I had the intuition when I started the company that this was not going to be a blip. I would say in the fall of 2022, when for all real purposes the pandemic was over, no one was talking about it as much anymore. But parents were still looking for alternatives. Parents were still saying, I'm choosing to homeschool. And homeschooling numbers were rising. And teachers were looking for different career paths. And the ESA programs were passing.

Ela Bass (34:55.374)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (35:01.773)
Mmm.

Amar Kumar (35:02.003)
I was like, okay, something is happening that confirms this hypothesis we've had that people aren't choosing these alternatives because of COVID anymore. They're choosing them because COVID showed them something that they cannot unsee. It showed them the importance of being involved, being self-directed, et cetera. That's when I was first sort of aware that something bigger is happening. And then every fall since then, as we see these numbers going up and up and

Ela Bass (35:16.782)
Mmm.

Amar Kumar (35:31.537)
it just further validates it.

Ela Bass (35:34.424)
Yeah, I mean, we mentioned this at the beginning, but it is quite interesting that ESA programs are passing more, that there are more state-led opportunities for personalized education and for resources inside of education. Why do you think that is happening? Because usually, like in the past, you would assume that alternative education would be something that people are doing on their own, on the side, not state-funded, not state-backed.

Amar Kumar (36:01.395)
That's right, that was the surprise for me is how much sort of public and institutional support has now come into the alternative space. I remember my prior job was at Connections Academy and we would hesitate to use the word cranes when we heard the word alternative education. It's like, oh, that means weird, that means like dropouts. We don't wanna be associated with that. And it's like now it's like a badge of honor to say we're building an alternative. So I don't know why it has happened this way. I think part of it is

Ela Bass (36:21.966)
Thank

Amar Kumar (36:31.217)
because of all the shutdowns and how successful private schools were during the pandemic, think parents just started to say, why are you keeping this option away from me? Parents started to exercise their voice more, and that's great for society. So it created this pressure in the politics of education to fund some of these alternatives. And that's just accelerated. And for the first time, think school choice has become politically

good. It's not always been that way. And, you I live in Massachusetts where in 2016, the state rejected charter expansion and Massachusetts has the most successful charter sector anywhere. And it the first charter school, it's the most successful charter schools, the largest charter sector by some measures, but the public rejected expansion because of politics. I think there was this

Ela Bass (37:26.061)
why.

Amar Kumar (37:29.437)
Confusing message we you know people always have charters take money away from the public system even though charters are public schools and Families we should follow families which the dollars should follow the child in the families and charters enable that to happen So that's the politics that got in the way and you know even now at school choice and education savings accounts people say this defunds public systems and my response is

Ela Bass (37:44.375)
Hmm.

Amar Kumar (37:56.051)
It's just funding the families. Surely you're not against funding the families to choose their option. If they choose to go to your school, they should. When they're choosing not to go to your school, then you're the one who's defunding your own school because you couldn't keep that family. And I don't think I mean that as an aggressive stance. I just mean it as a fact that if we think that our public system's path to victory will be to trap families, you've lost the argument.

Ela Bass (38:04.333)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (38:15.145)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (38:24.896)
Yeah, it's quite funny actually that argument. It means well and it usually comes from many of the most well-meaning people. But what's been really fascinating with open ed as well is that actually the most underserved families are the ones that we serve. The ones that often are struggling with something very terrible that like they need flexibility, they need something else. And also,

Amar Kumar (38:33.619)
Yeah, of course.

Ela Bass (38:52.78)
Something that Matt Bowman talks about a lot is just the fact that like the number one way to choose your school is actually just by choosing your zip code. And like that is one of the most difficult things. Like it is very natural. People do it all the time. But like that is more, you know, creating like lines of separation between people than say letting them choose their school.

Amar Kumar (39:19.047)
Yeah, I agree. And I'm not very ideological about many things. I want everyone to succeed and people to choose what they want and live and let live kind of a person. But this is one thing where I say, don't block people from exercising the right choice. And I'm grateful that we've sort of tried to be clear about that message. We're not anti-public or pro-private. We're just pro-choice when it comes to schools.

Ela Bass (39:34.744)
Yeah.

Amar Kumar (39:45.491)
And we're lucky that that message has actually resonated with some very forward-thinking school districts. So we're lucky enough to be starting the conversations with several school districts who want to open their own microschools. And they come to us or we go to them and the message that you really is, we're trying to get kids to microschools. There's no reason that those families should leave our district. We can run these microschools. And I say, good for you. Can I help you run that? Can I be a part of this?

Ela Bass (39:58.989)
Wow.

Ela Bass (40:13.442)
Wow.

Amar Kumar (40:14.991)
So that's the, I love seeing that happen. Now it's too few, it's rare, but the fact that that conversation is happening is exactly what school choice is all about. Create choices, increase competition, have all the boats rise versus only some get money and the others have to fend for themselves.

Ela Bass (40:36.098)
Yeah, that's quite fascinating. I actually saw an example of that in Kansas, actually. So in Kansas, Wichita, there's this thing called the Learning Lab, which I am very vocal. I love them. And inside of the Learning Lab, actually, they have a micro school that is run by the public school. it was a test program.

Amar Kumar (40:45.905)
Yeah. It's real.

Amar Kumar (40:53.843)
No, I'm good.

Ela Bass (40:58.798)
And what they're doing there is they're actually testing out different approaches to learning in a small environment and in an environment that's very adaptable and agile so that eventually they can help to improve their schools in in mass And I love that. I think that that is so cool There are lots of families one of their tools actually for recruiting for that micro school was They they basically ran some sort of a survey. They figured out how

all the families were feeling about their education. And they actually personally went to the families that were most likely to take their kids out of school. And they offered them a spot first and a lot of them took it.

Amar Kumar (41:34.385)
Hmm.

Amar Kumar (41:40.37)
love it.

I'm going to write this idea down. I like this because some of our district partners are thinking about how to spread awareness and just telling people there's a new option doesn't always work. But first learning from the families and then targeting a message is a great idea.

Ela Bass (41:53.55)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (41:59.788)
Yeah, no, it's, and it makes sense, because there are lots of families that are pulling their kids because something's not working. And oftentimes they didn't expect to do something alternative. They didn't expect to choose the hard mode, and they'd prefer not to, but something's not working.

Amar Kumar (42:14.279)
Yeah, that's great. Okay.

Ela Bass (42:20.738)
So I'm also curious, when did you realize that school was not working?

Amar Kumar (42:31.741)
That's a big question.

I don't think I realized it when I was going through school. I think I realized it when I was a teacher. Yeah, that's probably the first time I said, wow.

Ela Bass (42:43.576)
Do you think it changed like in between those periods or no?

Amar Kumar (42:48.083)
You know, I don't think so. think it was fundamentally the same delivery mechanism. And I think when I was the teacher, I mean, when I was a kid, like a student, I was just like going through it, right? I was doing what I was told, make sure I did the homework, I showed up and get in trouble. That was my MO and I did fine. But I think when I became a teacher, I was like, this is painful. Like I prep every night for hours and then I show up and it's totally ineffective and these kids aren't learning or they're like,

failing their test, like, this is so broken. And I'm a somewhat smart person that I know I'm not doing it wrong. This is just how you do it. I think that's when I started to realize that this whole delivery structure is broken, right? This concept of, have this box of kids that are responsible for the next 45 minutes and I have to just download some information using my vocal cords.

Why is this the right way? And this was back in 2005 and 2006. Like I'm not even talking about technology at this point, right? No iPads. was just literal chalkboard. It's like, this can't be the best way. And that's, I think it's the first time I said, we can do better. And then I discovered online schooling, connections education. And I said, oh, okay. So now there's a predefined curriculum that's already been written with videos and quizzes and tests or exercises. And the child,

Ela Bass (43:57.836)
Mm. Mm-hmm.

Amar Kumar (44:11.581)
turns on their laptop, and then they work through that content at their own pace. They can take extra time, they can go faster if they need, and there's always an online teacher available to support them when they sort of raise the flag that I need help. I was like, this is amazing. Like, this is personalized, it's very student driven, and then the educator isn't doing the lesson plan every day, because the lesson plan's already built into a course. The educator's just supporting the kids as they need them. So I dedicated my entire

Ela Bass (44:15.374)
Mm.

Ela Bass (44:35.842)
Mm.

Amar Kumar (44:41.459)
like brain space and soul into connections education. And I think they're doing incredible work. The challenge is socialization, right? These kids are home alone doing their work. And the parents often have to do a lot of the heavy lifting to keep the kids motivated. And that's where the idea for ChiPod came in is what if we take the best of that online education, but deliver it in a small pod. ChiPod comes from the word pod.

deliver in a small pod and allow the kids to choose their pace. And then the educator who's on site doesn't have to teach anymore. They're just coaching. And that just, that's, that's the rest is history.

Ela Bass (45:18.798)
Mm.

Ela Bass (45:22.808)
That actually makes sense too, because like the idea of online school, like there are lots of public schools that offer an online school alternative because families need it and they use it. However, most of the time it's not working the way that they wanted it to. And I would point that to the socialization aspect, but not just like, you know, your kids don't have friends. It's like, okay, kids don't have friends. And that's really important because friends that care about their education influence your kids to care about their education.

Amar Kumar (45:50.256)
me.

Ela Bass (45:52.344)
but also on the other level, like when a kid has a problem, who do they even go to? And like, do they know that people care about them? And as children learning, like that's very important. So that actually makes a lot of sense that like, as a natural evolution, we're getting to this point where we started on the right path, right? It's like, okay, well, there are alternative ways to learn. And actually I was reading Sal Khan's book recently and he was saying that like,

he realized that he could use class time differently because he had so many online options. like kids can go home and watch a video, they can go home and do all these different things. But like, what if we do class time differently? What in your opinion are the things that are most important to rethink about the classroom?

Amar Kumar (46:38.707)
Yeah, I think it's the what is the best way to deliver a piece of information or conduct an exercise or create a social learning opportunity for a child. If we're intentional about these things and don't say that the same adult has to do it for all the children at the same time, if we just release that constraint, then all of a sudden things open up. One of the things I read about when I was doing some research into ChiPod, like starting this thing is the importance of

mixed age groups, which you know, you're like, oh, whatever, like puts like sixth through eighth graders together. Wait, that's fine. But what happens when you're a teacher and you have a sixth grader, a seventh grader, eighth, you can't teach anymore. You can't say this is my lesson plan because you're like, oh my goodness, these kids are at different levels. You are forced to grapple with that. But if you're a teacher, let's say just sixth graders,

Ela Bass (47:09.422)
Mm.

Ela Bass (47:22.061)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (47:29.71)
Mm.

Amar Kumar (47:34.407)
They might all technically be sixth graders, but you already know that some of them are doing fourth grade level math and some of them are doing eighth grade level math. You are not forced to grapple with it. You're just told to develop a sixth grade lesson plan. So the sort of mixed-age classroom can be a Trojan horse to introduce a totally different way of teaching. And one of the things we encourage every single micro school owner in our network is to say mixed-age classroom.

Ela Bass (47:42.05)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (47:47.554)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (47:57.602)
Mm.

Amar Kumar (48:03.155)
You have to have them because it will force you to show up differently and will force you to decentralize, to personalize more. And they hate it. They don't want to do it because they're not used to it. But as soon as they do it, something flips in their brain. They're like, oh, this is so much better because I am not the bottleneck anymore. The kids are driving their learning. So it's a keystone things that like

Ela Bass (48:25.646)
So what is it?

Amar Kumar (48:29.095)
People don't talk about it as much, if we just let all school districts have to have mixed-age classrooms, I feel like the average quality of education would go up a lot because you would just be forced to try things different.

Ela Bass (48:30.477)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (48:36.898)
That's funny.

Ela Bass (48:40.566)
Yeah, you'd notice a lot more too. You'd notice the chaos, you'd notice like you couldn't even hide from it. What is a day in the life of a normal ChiPod teacher look like?

Amar Kumar (48:53.361)
Yeah, it's I mean, they are business owners, school operators and teachers, right? So they have all these hats that they wear. So typically, you know, they'll show up at their school at 730 or eight. They'll open the doors. It's their own location. So it's theirs. They welcome the kids. There might be some circle time or some community building activity. They might have academics where they're coaching kids. You know, they're not standing in front of teaching. There might be an enrichment. They might take a field trip, do lunch together at a community table. So it's a very social.

dynamic environment with the same group of kids. And I keep saying that because it's important. It's the same group of kids. And that allows this like real depth of interaction, this real nuance of who are you as a child? Do I understand your rhythms? Like I know that after a lot you have this crash, which means we're not going to do math at one o'clock in the afternoon. We're going to do math earlier, right? But at one o'clock we're going to play UNO or you know, something else because you need that to lift you back up.

And so teachers get to know all of that. And then, know, kids go home around three or four or whatever. And then the teacher sort of wraps up for the day and they're, you know, maybe they attend to the business side of their school. So they may answer new parent leads. They may respond to parent communication. They might balance their books on Fridays or whatever. Right. So our support for them is to do a lot of that in an automated way so that they can focus on kids all day and they don't have to do a lot of the business side of things.

And for the teachers who sort of get into this rhythm, they've got good enrollment and good culture. I mean, one of them said to me, it's so weird the way she said it, I want to die on the floor of this micro school. She's like, I don't want to do anything else the rest of my life. is all I want. It's a weird way to say it. But she's like, this is all I want to do because I've discovered my purpose. And I love hearing that.

Ela Bass (50:37.995)
That is so funny.

Ela Bass (50:48.93)
That's amazing. I think that's a good reminder. I don't know, just in this scope of open education, right? And this mix and match mentality that there are people that are so desiring to teach your kid well. That is their purpose in life. That is their desire. That is their only hope. They just want to change a kid's life. And yeah, you do not have to do it all alone.

Amar Kumar (51:14.097)
I I taught 17 years ago. I still remember the name of all the kids, like literally every single one, because like we're just so driven by that. That is our sense of purpose. And when we realize we're not fulfilling our purpose, we look for something else, because that is more important. And these teachers, when they discover it, they're just, they're in heaven.

Ela Bass (51:36.908)
Yeah, I've seen a lot of teachers move into actually different fields recently because they just like, it is really hard to stay in a system that is not allowing you to do what you want to do. Yeah.

Okay, I'm about to hit you with some rapid fire questions to end us off. Question number one, what is the most exciting thing to you in alternative education slash open education right now?

Amar Kumar (51:55.987)
Okay, good.

Amar Kumar (52:03.955)
Parents getting involved. Parents saying, want this, where can I find it?

Ela Bass (52:08.782)
I love it. In your mind, what is the most amazing future that you can imagine in 10 years?

Amar Kumar (52:18.129)
a million new schools, literally a million new schools across America that are all in retail storefronts and churches and community centers, and they are creating mountains of opportunities for kids. So if I live in Baxter, Massachusetts, I have 15 new schools to choose from, and every parent should have lots of choices. Then we have to teach them how to make the choice, but I would love to see a million new schools over the next decade or so.

Ela Bass (52:26.04)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (52:34.872)
you

Ela Bass (52:45.954)
That's cool. And then a follow up question to that, but before I get to my third question, do you think we'd rethink community at that point? So like the way that we do, like how kids make friends, how they find their circles.

I think so. Yeah, I think so. I think we have to. And social media is already supercharging that conversation. But I think micro schools are a little bit of an antidote to that trend. In a big school, kids just feel lost. So they retreat to the screen. And then we ban the screen, and they're like, I'm still lost. Whereas in a micro school, no kid is ever lost. No one.

Ela Bass (53:00.014)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (53:13.57)
Yeah.

Amar Kumar (53:23.845)
is absent without everyone noticing. Everyone is seen all the time, and that's a good thing. Then kids don't feel the need to escape into social media as much. So I think we've seen some really healthy examples of community at micro schools that are not digital. They're actually live and in person.

Ela Bass (53:26.478)
Mm.

Ela Bass (53:41.145)
Mm-hmm.

That's amazing. And my third and final question for you. So you mentioned that you're like, it would be amazing if all families got personally involved in their children's education. What is a resource or a book or some sort of something that you'd recommend for people to actually learn how to do that? Because that's not.

Amar Kumar (54:00.305)
Yeah, I mean, the world's expert on this is Carrie McDonald. She has a book about this exact topic that I would highly recommend. She just released it. It's called Joyful Learning. That talks about lots of different examples and that I think will open up a parent's mind to all the options that exist. And once you read that book, you don't forget. You don't forget. You don't have to read like covered. You can like skim the examples. You just don't forget. You're just like, my goodness, all this is available and I'm not taking advantage of it.

That's what gets a parent to sit up straight and take action. And that's what I want to.

Ela Bass (54:35.816)
