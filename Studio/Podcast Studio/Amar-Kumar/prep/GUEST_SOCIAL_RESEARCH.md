  - Outschool collaboration announcement

  - Legal/compliance workshops for microschool startups

**Analysis:** LinkedIn is clearly their strongest channel. Both Amar's personal profile and the company page get consistent, meaningful engagement. Amar's posts that include compelling data points perform best.

---

### X/Twitter - UNDERUTILIZED

**Amar Kumar (@AmarKumarEdu)**
- **Status:** Account exists since 2008 but appears largely inactive
- **Followers:** 2,015
- **Activity:** Minimal recent posting (profile did not load properly for verification)

**KaiPod Learning (@KaiPodCo)**
- **Joined:** February 2021
- **Followers:** 1,208
- **Following:** 121
- **Bio:** "Find or start a microschool in your community with help from KaiPod"
- **Sample Post:** "💫 What makes KaiPod truly magical? Our students share the five elements that make our learning environments overflow with joy and excitement! ✨"
- **Content Style:** Student-focused, emotionally engaging, visual

**Analysis:** Twitter/X is a significant missed opportunity. Both accounts have audiences but appear to post infrequently. The company account is more active than Amar's personal account.

---

### Instagram - MODERATE ENGAGEMENT

**KaiPod Learning (@kaipodco)**
- **Followers:** 4,383
- **Following:** 337
- **Posts:** 749
- **Bio:** "We make education personal" + links to find a microschool, start your own, and access free family guide
- **Content Type:** Mix of photos and likely stories/reels (based on post count)
- **Posting Frequency:** Fairly active (749 posts suggests regular content creation)

**Analysis:** Instagram has a decent following but is smaller than LinkedIn. The "we make education personal" tagline is excellent. High post count suggests they use this platform consistently for visual storytelling.

---

### TikTok - EMERGING PRESENCE

**KaiPod Learning (@kaipodco)**
- **Status:** Account exists
- **Content:** Unknown (profile details not accessible)

**Analysis:** Having a TikTok presence shows forward-thinking social strategy, but unclear how actively they're using it.

---

### YouTube - NO ACTIVE CHANNEL

Neither Amar nor KaiPod appear to have active YouTube channels. KaiPod publishes a blog post about "[Top 52 Educational YouTube Channels for Microschools](https://www.kaipodlearning.com/top-52-educational-youtube-channels-for-microschools/)" but doesn't host original video content on YouTube.

**Analysis:** Opportunity for podcast episode to be uploaded to OpenEd's YouTube and shared with KaiPod for their networks.
