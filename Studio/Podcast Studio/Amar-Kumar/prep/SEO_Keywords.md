## Executive Summary

The microschool space shows moderate search interest with strong informational and how-to intent. "Microschool" (4,400/mo) and "microschool near me" (2,900/mo) dominate volume. The "how to start" query (260/mo) indicates entrepreneurial interest, and KaiPod Learning has 590 monthly searches as a brand term - good recognition for the space.

**Key SEO Opportunity:** Write a comprehensive "how to start a microschool" guide (2,000-3,000 words) targeting both the broad concept and state-specific variants (FL, TX). This has featured snippet potential and links naturally to Amar's expertise.

## Competitor Content Gap Analysis

### What Competitors Are Doing Well
1. **Step-by-step guides** - Georgia Policy has comprehensive PDF
2. **State-specific content** - Prenda focuses on Florida
3. **Video content** - KaiPod has YouTube presence
4. **Community directories** - Micro Schools Network has location finder

### What Competitors Are Missing (Your Opportunities)
1. **Multi-state comparison** - no one covers regulations across states
2. **Financial models** - tuition calculators, budget templates
3. **Mixed-age deep dive** - most focus on Montessori preschool, not K-8
4. **Founder interviews** - limited first-person narratives
5. **Failure stories** - no one addresses common mistakes or when microschools don't work
6. **Hybrid models** - part-time microschooling, co-ops
7. **Updated 2026 content** - most guides are 2021-2023
8. **Podcast format** - most content is text-based

**Recommendation:** Position OpenEd as the comprehensive, multi-format resource (podcast, blog, tools) for microschool research and startup.
