3. **"Mixed-Age Classrooms FORCE Teachers to Do This (It's Genius)"** (Angle C) - Operational insight, curiosity gap
4. **"Amar Kumar Built 80 Schools. Now He Wants a Million More."** (Combo) - Name recognition + ambition scale
5. **"The Best Teachers Never Teach (They Do This Instead)"** (Angle E) - Strong contrarian hook

- **Contrarian:** 18/30 (exodus is good, don't teach, trapped families)
- **Negativity:** 12/30 (want out, trapped, doing it wrong)

### McDonald's Test Results
