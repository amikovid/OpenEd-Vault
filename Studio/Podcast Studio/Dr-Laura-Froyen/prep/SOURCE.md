## Ela’s Notes: 

0:00: OK, so today's podcast is honestly not as great as yesterday's, but they have been the flow.
0:05: so what did we talk about?
0:06: We talked a lot about how, a parent needs to understand that there are different needs inside of different kids and that you have spirited kids, you have neuro-spicy is a new word that she's using.
0:23: And, and basically, you have to understand that everybody has different.
0:29: Needs and as a parent, you have needs and integrating those into your family and integrating those into your homeschool is really important.
0:42: she talks about this is probably the best thing that was in that podcast is that.
0:48: For kids and young kids especially, and when you're trying to figure something out as a parent, using what questions instead of why questions is actually better.
0:58: So, let's say a kid is struggling with school and, or maybe they're struggling with soccer and they really don't wanna go.
1:06: Instead of saying, why don't you wanna go, which.
1:08: Is a very common response approaching it from the perspective of like, what about soccer practice is scary to you or what about soccer practice is making you not want to go or what is the hardest part about soccer practice and like trying to get into the, the concretes and the specifics.
1:29: And then she talks a lot about how like parents need to do their own work.
1:33: And yeah, I don't know.
1:36: Today's, it was, it was mid, but I hope that y'all find some good nuggets and pull it all out.


## Rough Transcript

Ela Bass (00:00.566)
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella and today I'm joined by Laura Freyhan. She is a parenting expert, a former family therapist and the host of the Balanced Parent podcast where she helps overwhelmed parents find calm connection and confidence through research and compassionate practices. Today I'm really, really excited to chat with her all about the ways that we can, number one,

be better parents in the way that we go ahead and approach our children, especially whenever things are really frustrating. And yeah, and how we can help our kids to be successful, happy individuals. So I wanted to start with a question. As you've begun your work and as you've dived into it and as you've done your podcast, what is the biggest, most surprising thing that you have learned?

Laura Froyen PhD (00:49.743)
Hmm.

I think, know, just even as a parent myself, not even in my work, but, you know, as a parent and in the work that I do, I think the biggest most surprising thing is how much of the work is actually ours as the adult. So often when we're looking for help with our kids, we're looking towards them. And most of the time, the biggest...

work is actually within us that we have to do. And so I think that that's probably it, that just the work is and the power for change really is within us. And that can be very freeing, can be very hard to face that we have work and shifts that need to be made, but also very powerful because we actually have quite a lot of ability to make moves.

Ela Bass (01:45.336)
Mmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (01:50.769)
when we're the ones we get to focus on.

Ela Bass (01:53.718)
Yeah, that's really beautiful. In practice, what does that look like? So you mentioned that we have a power for change. We have this ability to help the circumstances actually get better. And that is really beautiful because we have responsibility in it, but we also have the ability to change the circumstances over time. What are some of the most common things that you deal with as a therapist and also in your podcast? What are the most common things that you're seeing today?

Laura Froyen PhD (02:24.099)
Yeah, so I primarily work with parents in parent coaching and many of my clients come with either spirited kiddos or with some level of neuro spiciness as the kind of the term that parents are coming to me with these days. So I'm rolling with that. And a lot of a lot of our work together is helping them really understand what's going on for their kids.

in the moment of difficulty. So I really like the iceberg analogy. I don't know if you've talked about that on your podcast before, but the idea that, you know, the most of the mass of an iceberg actually is under the surface of the water. And the same is true for lots of our kids' behaviors. We see a small portion of what's going on for the kid in a behavior, whether it's acting out, refusing to do a certain piece of work, and then

really learning to look under the surface or what's really going on, what's driving the behavior is a lot of our work. So I get to do a lot of helping parents reframe the behavior that they're seeing, put a positive lens on it. And a lot of the families that come to me, because I do get some of the most behaviorally challenging kids come into my practice.

and often it's been going on for a long time. And so there's this other piece of it where that's exhausting. It's hard, it's heavy. And many parents have lost the joy that they feel with their kids or they've lost the ability to see the goodness and the light and all of those other pieces that their kids' unique flavor brings to the family. So I love helping with that too, helping them get back to being able to...

Ela Bass (03:57.524)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (04:19.469)
see the whole picture of their kids instead of just seeing the problem.

Ela Bass (04:24.556)
Yeah, and something we love to chat about on the podcast is that, you know, parenting is very difficult, but with homeschool families, especially, you are at home with your kids or you are with your kids a lot of the time, a lot more than, you know, most families are all together. And so when there are problems, when there are challenges, when there are children that are a little bit more difficult or a little bit more spirited or like, and it's really, really hard to manage that, so to speak, like

Yeah, it's even more exacerbated, right? And as a parent, you get even more tired with it. So when you're working with parents and you're trying to help them to work through this, where do you begin?

Laura Froyen PhD (05:07.535)
Yeah, so I think first starting, you so if you're in a place with one of your kiddos and you're noticing just this kind of negative tendency, where it just feels like all of your interactions are starting to be flavored or kind of tainted, the very first intervention I would want someone to try would be to start actively looking to infuse positivity and connection back into that relationship.

Whether that means, you know, if there is a subject that is a constant source of conflict, can we take a small break from that for a few days and do something that we know will bring up that level of connection again? What are some of the things that, you know, where we feel really connected to this kid or where this kid, you know, has moments where, you know, they can really shine and be successful, where we see them light up again?

Ela Bass (05:47.822)
Mm.

Laura Froyen PhD (06:00.975)
I'm really focusing in first and foremost on the relationship and on getting that positivity flowing between the kid. I think too for challenging kids, have this another, it's okay for me to use more analogies. Yeah, so I think about all kids as being kind of on their own whitewater rafting trip.

Ela Bass (06:09.07)
Mm.

Ela Bass (06:17.302)
Yeah, for sure. I love it.

Laura Froyen PhD (06:26.161)
They're in a raft and I don't know if you've ever been whitewater rafting before, Ella? You've seen it, right? Okay. So usually when you go, you're about to get onto the boat. They give you kind of a crash course on what to do if you get knocked out of the boat. And then you just get in and you go and you hope for the best. And at first it's fun. The water is fast. It's lit up. And then there's times where...

Ela Bass (06:31.67)
I have not, but I have seen it, for sure.

Laura Froyen PhD (06:51.909)
the river narrows, there's more rocks, things start to get a little bumpy. And for lots of these kids who find life challenging or who have more challenging behaviors, their river has more rapids in it, and they actually get knocked out of the boat quite a lot. They get thrown out of the boat, they end up in the water, having to kind of just hold on and hang out until the rapids recede and they can get back into that boat.

Ela Bass (06:54.722)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (07:07.779)
Mm.

Ela Bass (07:18.691)
Hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (07:20.271)
And so for a lot of these kids, especially for families who, if you've had a stretch of really tricky stuff with your kid, like just it seems like it's ramping up, it's really negative. It helps me to think about for those kids that they've been thrown out of the boat a lot. They've just spent a lot of time in the river and they need time to recover so that they can get back to that feeling of joy. So sometimes kids, the kids experience burnout just like adults do. And if there is a lot of, if there's

Ela Bass (07:28.098)
Mm.

Ela Bass (07:43.104)
Hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (07:49.701)
different neurodiversities happening, different pieces at play, they may need a break. And part of what I do with families is help them figure out where are the rapids in their kids' days? Which rapids can, you know, we don't wanna have a completely smooth river for our kids, right? The rapids can be fun, as anybody who's loved learning and loved learning something challenging has.

Ela Bass (08:03.406)
Mmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (08:17.103)
has figured out, know, like that can be really fun and delightful, but not if we're in it all day, every day, right? So which rapids can we remove? Which, you know, little, is there a little river that we can take, just a little side tributary to go around them temporarily until things calm down, until things aren't so hard, and then they can face that challenge with a little bit more resources and capacity. So I really love finding those pieces and helping parents realize that they can set expectations aside.

Ela Bass (08:22.946)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (08:38.158)
Mm.

Laura Froyen PhD (08:46.725)
temporarily, not forever, but just temporarily so that a kid can recover and come back to them with more capacity.

Ela Bass (08:55.424)
Yeah. So how much of this is like personality versus the experiences that happened to us versus like, I know it's like a very complex, like interwoven web, but like,

Laura Froyen PhD (09:04.145)
Yeah, I mean, just thinking about like the personality or temperament really when we think about kids, how we respond to unexpected changes. Are we able to think flexibly and creatively on our feet or are we more rigid in our thinking? All of those things come into play. And then there's all of the other pieces of it. Like, where are we in the skill that's being asked of us? Do we need more supports in that moment?

Ela Bass (09:28.205)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (09:34.543)
I mean, just even thinking about getting out of the door in the morning. I guess your families aren't doing that, but let's say we're going to a meetup or something. We need to get out of the door. Is that going to be easier for a kid who's well rested and well nourished versus a kid who had trouble sleeping the night before or wasn't able to find something that worked well for them for breakfast? Do you know what I mean? There's all sorts of things that can get into play.

Ela Bass (09:58.796)
Yeah.

Laura Froyen PhD (10:01.933)
Oftentimes parents are used to hearing about this in terms of like the window of tolerance for us as adults. You what are the things that allow us to handle the stuff that life throws at us well versus what are those moments when we're stressed, our window is narrowed and we can't. Kids have a window of tolerance too. They need just as much care to their nervous system to keep that window nice, wide open so that they can handle their days.

Ela Bass (10:06.968)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (10:26.188)
I'm curious what your thoughts are on the tough it out mentality. when, when, you know, there have been times in, I mean, even my life and, the lives of the people around me where like a tough it out mentality was actually a good thing because it called me to, you know, show up in a way that was better than I thought I could. But there have also been areas where like that mentality definitely was not helpful. And it just like kept me along a path that I probably should have taken a step.

Laura Froyen PhD (10:44.753)
and

Ela Bass (10:54.594)
breathe and like, reconvene for a moment. When, as a parent especially, because right, you're looking at your child, you know your child intimately, you're spending a lot of time with them. When are you trying to decide, okay, this is something that we need to intervene, pull back on, try and like adjust the circumstances versus I think that they can do this, I think that they can get through this, I think that they should just keep on going in this.

Laura Froyen PhD (11:23.025)
Well, Ella, can I turn that question back on you? Yeah. For you in those moments where you can, with, you know, hindsight, reflect back, like, what is the difference for you? Those moments where, gosh, I really think I could have pushed through that and that would have been good for me, or, gosh, I think I really didn't need to be so hard on myself. I could have offered myself a little grace and compassion. What is the... How do you find that for yourself now as an adult?

Ela Bass (11:25.857)
I love it, yeah.

Ela Bass (11:52.874)
I mean, quite difficult. Yeah, right.

Laura Froyen PhD (11:53.585)
Good question. It's so hard. Yeah. And we can't, we can't, sometimes it's only with hindsight. Can we know? Right? So there is this process of recognizing this is a really hard human skill, right? So this is an important skill for humans to have. How lovely that we have this generation of kids who's maybe starting to learn it as children instead of having to figure out as adults, like we are having to do, right? But we're going to get it wrong.

Ela Bass (12:06.882)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (12:20.566)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (12:22.897)
we're going to make mistakes, we're going to push sometimes when we should have backed off and we're going to have moments where we didn't push and maybe we should have. So I think getting really comfortable with that idea that we're not going to get this right. And then I also think that learning to really trust your child and getting really good at helping them suss that out for themselves. So what are the things we need to do to help them self-reflect?

Ela Bass (12:45.454)
Mm.

Laura Froyen PhD (12:53.521)
kind of take stock of their capacities, take stock of their goals, know, of their big picture goals versus the short term goals, right? That they, you know, really are not great at until they're 13, 14, right? So younger kids are very much in the moment and help them with that. Just to share a story about my daughter who's 10.

Ela Bass (12:56.93)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (13:10.286)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (13:22.233)
She does jiu jitsu, which is a very physically demanding sport. she is in a, gym that she goes to is a membership style. So she can go any day of the week. They have classes every day. She can go. And she's always really glad when she gets there. She has lots of fun, works really hard. She feels wrung out when she gets home, but it's great for her. But the going is hard.

Ela Bass (13:27.064)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (13:51.865)
sometimes, right? And she's doing a lot of hard work right now at 10 in analyzing her capacity, thinking about, so if I don't go today, I'm gonna have to go tomorrow, because I need to go at least two times a week. That's our agreement that we have as a family. You know, and just figuring those things out. And there are days where I have to sit with her and say, Ebi, do you need this work in your body, or do you need...

Ela Bass (13:52.462)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (14:19.281)
to be compassionate and graceful with yourself? What is the message that your body is sending to you? And so there's a piece of this that is working with the kid, where we're not necessarily making the decision for the kid, we're helping them learn how to go through that process themselves. And then of course there are times where if we're homeschooling with a family of four, we've got three other kids to think about, sometimes we do have to just kind of.

and go and do the thing. And then we can have conversations around like, this is non-negotiable. What can we do to make this more accessible to you? What can we do, you know, in the moment to make it more possible? So maybe you don't have capacity to be out in the world today, but we have to, and I can't leave you home alone. You know, can we bring headphones and an audio book so that you can just be in your own world, get that rest you need while I take your siblings to the museum? Do you know what I mean?

Ela Bass (14:57.454)
That's really cool.

Ela Bass (15:16.694)
Yeah, that's very, very cool. So if someone has a lot of children and let's say that, you know, there's maybe one or two that are particularly challenging, you would recommend sitting down with each one very individually and just like really trying to understand them. What are the best questions to start with? And I imagine that it changes depending on the age that they are. But what are some of the best questions that you've seen are helpful when talking to a kid and trying to understand them?

Laura Froyen PhD (15:39.217)
Yeah.

Laura Froyen PhD (15:45.199)
Well, I love that question so much. Ella, love it. So the first thing I would direct you to Dr. Ross Green's work. I don't know, have you heard of him before? he's phenomenal. His work is all evidence-based. So his work is called Collaborative and Proactive Solutions. It's a model of collaborative problem solving that works really, really well.

Ela Bass (15:57.526)
I have not, actually.

Ela Bass (16:13.486)
Mm.

Laura Froyen PhD (16:14.063)
the most behaviorally challenging kids all the way down to to Boko kids. So he's got a number of books. His most popular book is The Explosive Child, but he also has a beautiful free website called lives in the balance dot org has tons of free training for parents. Highly recommend it. And what it's relevant to this question that you just asked, because he is really good.

Ela Bass (16:32.449)
That's cool.

Laura Froyen PhD (16:39.233)
at training parents and educators and people like me, I'm certified in his method, in how to drill but not grill for what's going on under a problem. And he teaches really good skills in terms of asking those questions for kids. So just to distill it all down for the listener right now, get the word why out of your vocabulary.

Ela Bass (16:48.43)
Mmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (17:05.443)
It is so tempting when our kids are having a hard time or don't want to go to dance or soccer or whatever, we want to say, why don't you want to go? Right? It's not helpful. Kids don't really know what we're asking. And all they know is that we're looking for an answer. And they give us whatever answer they think is most going to get them either their needs met or that what we want to hear because they want to stay in connection with us.

Ela Bass (17:05.783)
Laura Froyen PhD (17:33.733)
So why is not a helpful question? What is a much more helpful question? What's feeling hard about dance class today? What's the most challenging part of thinking about getting ready to go? If we're thinking about coming to the dinner table or sitting down to do your double division problems during math class, like really,

Ela Bass (17:42.19)
Mmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (18:02.677)
narrowing in on, you know, when you think about sitting down to get started on your math homework, what is the hardest part about that? You know, and really like getting into the nitty gritty of things like that, you know, when you when you sit your body down, if there anything about that, that's hard. Well, the chair is uncomfortable. OK, so the chair is uncomfortable. Anything else? And you know, it's easy to jump to problem solving right away. But really, you just want to gather information.

Ela Bass (18:15.79)
Hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (18:31.481)
What's the first thing that goes through your mind when I tell you it's time for math class? When you get started on X, Y, and Z, how does that usually go for you? Tell me more. So using the questions other than why, basically, are what you want to be looking for. And you want to get really good at asking the question that is going to get your kid to open the right

Ela Bass (18:47.926)
Hmm

Laura Froyen PhD (18:59.441)
part of their brain. So our brains are kind of set up like filing systems. And when we ask a really general question, like, what don't you like about homeschooling? That's a big question, right? So we want to really narrow things down. So on Tuesdays when you do reading with your sister, Gracie, that seems hard for you. What about doing reading on Tuesdays with Gracie is hard. That type of really specific question

Ela Bass (19:26.51)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (19:28.077)
allows them to know which drawer to open in their filing system, which file to pull out, and where exactly to look for an answer.

Ela Bass (19:35.586)
That's really, really fascinating. And I assume that this is like a pretty long process that you're locking in for though, like as a parent.

Laura Froyen PhD (19:44.529)
I mean, this was true of all attempts of being respectful parenting. It is, but what's beautiful about this process where you're asking these questions, where you're really getting to the root of it, is that you're actually teaching all of the skills that they need to be able to do those things themselves, right? So.

Ela Bass (19:50.498)
for sure.

Ela Bass (20:04.098)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (20:09.251)
Yes.

Laura Froyen PhD (20:09.945)
If a kid is having trouble breaking down an assignment into its component parts, what did we just model through that? Breaking something down into its parts. If a kid is having trouble perspective taking, and we're working through a conflict that we're having, there's this part where you help them understand what you're thinking, the concerns you have.

Ela Bass (20:21.037)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (20:35.665)
This whole process teaches kids the exact skills they need to navigate the more challenging parts of their lives, as opposed to a timeout or extra homework problems don't necessarily teach the skills that they need to get through those, the rapids, right, of their lives.

Ela Bass (20:45.676)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (20:52.736)
Yeah, it's like it's like teaching them the skill of not what to think, but how to think and like as as a parent and like I'm not saying that that it takes a long time as something that would dissuade, but just like like acknowledging the fact that when you are going to try and confront something that is not working well in your family or something that's not working inside of a child and you really want to help them to find.

Laura Froyen PhD (20:59.184)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (21:20.042)
what is going to work, it is a process. so like having patience with yourself and with them throughout that whole thing, right, is very, very important.

Laura Froyen PhD (21:26.929)
And the process too, right? So I'm sure so many of your listeners are so deeply invested in the process for their kids as opposed to the outcome, right? So you're looking, your listeners are looking for deep, meaningful learning, not a grade, right? And so when it comes to problem solving like this, we're totally focused on the process.

Ela Bass (21:40.418)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (21:47.073)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (21:52.121)
If we come up with a solution that we try out and it doesn't work, that means nothing about our success. Because the process is what was actually helpful for the kid. And figuring out something that doesn't work, the outcome, it's not a failure. It's just something that didn't work. And we'll try it again. We must have missed something. So you're absolutely right. And thinking about that from the long game.

The other piece of it is that, you know, I'm guessing most of your families are choosing to homeschool for a variety of reasons. But then a big one is for closeness. They want to be with their families. They want their kids to feel seen and heard and understood and, you know, held and known. This is a beautiful way to achieve that goal,

Ela Bass (22:42.222)
Yeah, I love that. Is there anything that you and your family have implemented in your own daily lives that like help you to have that just like temp check with your kids of like, okay, you know, are you good? Is there anything going on? Is it mostly you as a parent looking at behaviors or how as a parent do you make sure that you're staying on top of things for your family?

Laura Froyen PhD (23:04.901)
Yeah, mean, like checking in for myself, just noticing their behaviors. If one of my kids wakes up kind of on the wrong side of the bed, reducing the demand, like automatically reducing the demands that I place on them during that wake up time. So there's a little bit of kind of being awareness of the temperature of the kid and their capacities, asking them to reflect on their capacities.

Ela Bass (23:26.926)
Mm.

Laura Froyen PhD (23:32.561)
So like if they're working on something, like if one of my kids is doing Lego and I start hearing that sound, I'm sure parents know what that sound, know, the frustration sound that can come with Lego at a certain stage, you know, saying, hey, I'm starting to hear a little bit of frustration. Can you check in with your body? Do you need a break? Do you need a snack? You know, so like there's that piece of it. And what's beautiful now, so my kids are older, they're almost 11 and 13. You know, they're all,

Ela Bass (23:42.87)
Mm-hmm

Ela Bass (23:54.402)
Hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (24:01.893)
be times where I ask them to do something and they will say, mom, I really want to do that, but I don't have capacity right now. I need a break and then I'll do it. And then the work again is on me of being able to recognize that honor, their truth, not off the hook and just never do it, but trust that if they're telling me they're at capacity and they need to recharge that I...

that I can trust them and that they will do what they need to do to recharge and come back to it when they have more capacity.

Ela Bass (24:34.52)
Dang, that's really, really cool. So is it, you mentioned the asking what questions instead of why questions. Is there any other tool that you use consistently or that you teach other families to use that you found to be very helpful?

Laura Froyen PhD (24:49.839)
I mean, just approaching things with curiosity, always. Not, you know, very rarely taking stuff at face value. yeah. And, you know, the...

Laura Froyen PhD (25:04.942)
I think giving permission, once you're out of the toddler years, there is so much more time to take a pause, to take a beat. When very little learning happens really fast, you have to kind of be in the moment. But once we're at four, we've got time. We have time to circle back. Nothing is an emergency usually, unless someone's bleeding.

Ela Bass (25:13.015)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (25:28.782)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (25:31.537)
Most of the time there is time to really slow down. So like the slowing down piece of it. And then the other part that I do, a lot of the work I do with parents is on their own nervous system, learning how to be regulated within themselves as opposed to stuffing, holding onto things, know, like white knuckling through the more challenging times, like actually working on their own sense of, of wellbeing and steadiness.

Ela Bass (25:53.004)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (26:00.622)
I want to get into that. But before I do, actually want to keep on understanding. So you mentioned the term neuro spicy, and I've never heard that before, but that's a good one. Let's say that you had a family that was coming to you. They have one neuro spicy kid with three other kids. They're trying to homeschool and mom's just really trying to figure it out. But like it is chaos most days. How would you recommend them to to help?

Laura Froyen PhD (26:24.75)
No.

Ela Bass (26:29.26)
their family find the right pace and the right balance so that she can attend to her Neuro Spicy Kid the right way, but also attend to the rest of her children.

Laura Froyen PhD (26:42.065)
Yeah, and meet the other kids where they are while meeting. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it certainly isn't easy. And so there is a piece of needing to recognize for that mom, recognize within herself that she is deserving of compassion and grace and time and space to figure it out. What's beautiful about homeschooling is that you are not on anyone else's schedule and you have that time. So offering the

Ela Bass (26:44.395)
Exactly.

Laura Froyen PhD (27:09.809)
the parent themselves a little bit of grace, a little bit of space, because it can feel like an emergency within our bodies and we actually don't make great decisions. We're not great problem-solvers when we're in that state of emergency. So just a little bit of recognition, like, wow, this is a big puzzle that we have to put together and we don't have to do it super fast, that there is space. I think it would be helpful probably for the parent to, if there is a kiddo who's presenting with some

some executive functioning pieces, you know, to really break down what all those pieces are. What's important, so this is something that I've heard from the autism community, you know, in response to people saying, well, aren't we all a little bit autistic? And I had a guest on my podcast who was like, the fact of the matter is, that autistic traits or, you know, ADHD traits, these traits that are part of,

the neuro spiciness, they are human traits. They just, some folks have more in different clusters and they work together in different ways, but they are all human traits. And so it might even be helpful for this parent to sit down with all of their kids and look at all of the ways in which they're different. Because we are, neurodiversity is the idea that we are all diverse in how our brains work, right? And so there is a piece where we have to look at

all the kids, where do we have capacities, where do we have things that we're working on, areas of growth. But in particular for those kids looking at what learning environment is right for them, what are some strategies and tools, getting support where they might need it. So it's okay too to look outside for some of the guidance that you might need.

And then helping the family get really, really comfortable with the idea of equity and justice. So oftentimes when there is one kid who needs accommodations, the other kids will say like, that's not fair. How come I have to do it and they don't? Do you know what I mean? And so teaching the concepts of equity and justice can be really helpful that we don't necessarily do everything equally.

Laura Froyen PhD (29:32.187)
but everybody gets what they need. And all of our needs as humans are different. It can be helpful to talk about it from the allergy sense. So if you have one person who has a nut allergy and I'm making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for everyone else and this person gets a ham sandwich, I'm not gonna make them eat a nut-based sandwich. Do you know what I mean? Kids can grasp some of that.

I also really like the imagery that came out of the social justice movement on equity and diversity. There's a graphic image where there's children, one in a wheelchair, one is a baby trying to watch a baseball game over a fence. Have you seen this image? Yeah, it's easy to Google. You just Google picture describing equity versus equality.

Ela Bass (30:15.626)
I am not, no.

Laura Froyen PhD (30:26.713)
And in the image they give each kid the same size box so that they can look over the fence. And of course these kids are of different heights. So one kid gets a box and he can't see over the fence, but no one else can. And so even though they got the same thing, it's not actually just or fair. And then equity is giving everybody what they need. And that picture can be really, really helpful in teaching kids that there will be times where

where you are going to get more or less based on your needs. And it doesn't mean, you we love you any more or less, or it doesn't mean we care any more or less. It just means that we are, we are a big family and we are taking a look at everybody's needs. And in this family, everybody gets what they need, not always what they want, but what they need.

Ela Bass (31:16.174)
I think this is a good point to actually go into the conversation about motherhood because as mothers, oftentimes we give up what we need in order to give it for other people. And in a lot of ways it harms mothers because then they can't show up the ways that they could if their cup was fuller. What have you been, yeah.

Laura Froyen PhD (31:24.41)
I think too.

Laura Froyen PhD (31:36.345)
It also harms mothers just because we're human beings who have needs, right? it's so, it's so, you know, Ella, just, just side note that it's, whenever I teach like self care, those things, the hook is a way as it allows you to show up better for your kids. And I know that's the hook we need, right? But the truth of the matter is, that we're just humans who are deserving of love and care full stop. But yes, it does make us better moms. But, but.

Ela Bass (32:03.006)
No, I think that's a good point. like, yeah, I mean, the the immediate like thing, you're right, that gets us to listen is, hey, you can show up better for your kids. But also, yeah, you have things that you just need by yourself. So when you have that conversation with moms, how do you help them take stock of their, you know, what what are my needs? What are the things that I need to prioritize for myself in order to make sure that I can

Laura Froyen PhD (32:05.796)
Right?

Ela Bass (32:30.542)
just show up the way that I want to for myself, but also the way that I want to for my kids and my family.

Laura Froyen PhD (32:37.041)
Hmm, yeah, so I teach the window of tolerance. So if that's a concept that's new to a listener, it's easy to Google. And the idea is that we all have a window of what we can handle well. So when our window is wide open, we can handle whatever life throws at us well. And when our window is narrow, we can't. So, you know.

Ela Bass (33:00.622)
Mm.

Laura Froyen PhD (33:02.365)
on a day where we are well nourished, we got to eat all of our food and not just scraps from the kids' plates. We got a full night's rest. We maybe had a chance to move our body with joy. We maybe had a chance for a little bit of creativity or some play, whatever that looks like for us as adults. When the kids start bickering, we have capacity to handle that.

Ela Bass (33:23.758)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (33:24.369)
and our partner comes in and greets the kids and the dog but forgets to give us a kiss, we can handle that. We can say it without snapping. Do you know what I mean? We just have more capacity. so going through an exercise where you are sitting down with yourself, you're noticing what narrows your window and what widens it and how you can make sure to build that into the fabric of your days. So there's something that...

Ela Bass (33:33.885)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (33:51.835)
when we teach self care to parents, we think it's something separate. We think, okay, we're gonna go to the yoga class. We're gonna go take the walk, but it really needs to be integrated because otherwise we won't do it. It will feel, and then we get the hangups, like there's no time for me. I can't do that. That's a burden on my family, like those pieces. So I really highly advocate for getting really creative around how can I build that?

Ela Bass (33:55.661)
Mm.

Laura Froyen PhD (34:20.205)
into the very fabric of my day. So we have science on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Does it have to be in our house or can it be on a walk? And can I build in 10 minutes of science where the kids are running free and I'm listening to a meditation podcast? And during that 10 minutes of scientific exploration in the park, they don't, they're not allowed to speak to me. Do you know what I mean? Like there's just, how can we build that into the fabric of our days?

Ela Bass (34:22.998)
I love this.

Ela Bass (34:45.207)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (34:49.42)
That's a really great point that I've had guests spring up like loosely, but actually I haven't spent explicit time on it. So one of my guests actually has an hour of dedicated reading time for her whole family toward the end of the day. And it's their quiet time. And she said that it has been something that she's always kept as very important for her family's rhythm. And also,

Laura Froyen PhD (35:04.545)
I love that.

Ela Bass (35:15.926)
just so important for her and she's seen how her kids have flourished because of it, how she has flourished because of it. And I actually think asking that question is the right one. And the one that we do not often sit with, which is, you know, what do we need as a family? Not what do our kids need, not what do you know, what needs to be done for the house? It's like, what do we need as a family, mom included, dad included, all to show up well and.

Laura Froyen PhD (35:18.638)
Mmm.

Ela Bass (35:43.712)
those become the constraints. So it's like, okay, well, do I need more quiet time? Like I am the type of person that definitely needs a little bit more quiet time probably than the average person. And so how do I pull that into the way that I build the education that I have my kids into? And that's the beauty of homeschool is that you get to create it yourself. You get to say, okay, well, this is what works for our family. yeah, and that makes a lot of sense that.

that is actually a really beautiful place to begin with because then as a parent, it's not like, okay, well, I have to wake up at four in the morning to go get a workout. It's like, well, as a family, we are active people. So we are going to get active together. Or maybe it's like, okay, well, while the kids are in this specific thing, maybe a co-op or something like I have a gym right next to it or, you know, whatever it is to get creative about it.

Laura Froyen PhD (36:32.847)
Yeah. Yeah, I love that. And I think, too, it's so important to model that conversation out loud for our kids, to be able to say, all right, we're finding a really good rhythm. I think that this is working. The only thing I'm noticing is that on Wednesdays, I don't actually have time to sit down and eat lunch because there's this mismatch. So we have to figure out a way for me to nourish my body.

Ela Bass (36:44.462)
Mm.

Ela Bass (36:56.571)
huh.

Ela Bass (37:02.242)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (37:03.089)
And what can we do as a family to make sure mom's getting food in her tummy?

Ela Bass (37:07.95)
Yeah, and that's beautiful. And I think like something that I also have seen is I have a close close family member who she's amazing and she she's like the cook for her family and she loves cooking so much. But recently she's been reflecting on the fact that having to cook and clean and teach and do all these things with her kids is weighing on her a lot. And and she was saying that that a lot of people have been asking her why she doesn't let her kids cook. Right. Like use it as a as a time to teach them a life skill.

And she was reflecting on it. She's like, it would it would be so amazing if I could just, you know, come in and like they had cooked something and they're really proud of it too. And I think that's another way of getting creative. Like, OK, well, whenever you bake this into the fabric of the way that your family is, like we we know that everyone has needs, then they they actually probably over time can start looking for those needs as well. So like, hey, mom's not getting lunch.

Laura Froyen PhD (37:56.142)
don't know.

Laura Froyen PhD (38:05.253)
Absolutely.

Ela Bass (38:06.412)
Like, let me make her something special and I think she'd be really excited. I think that's really beautiful too.

Laura Froyen PhD (38:09.913)
Yeah. And I, you know, for your friend too, thinking about, so if I really love cooking or I really love baking, when am I doing it for the joy of it versus when am I doing it to fill in, like fill the like, okay, so I have to feed the kids or I have to, you know, we're learning measurements, but baking is a great opportunity. But now all of a sudden baking is work.

Ela Bass (38:23.918)
Mm.

Ela Bass (38:36.066)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (38:36.409)
and baking used to be my joy. So like, how can we have good boundaries with ourselves around those things? You know, so like if baking is one of your hobbies, it's great to build it into homeschool, but then also protect yourself, protect like, okay, but when I make the sourdough bread, that's my time. That like, that's for me. We're gonna maybe we'll make scones or we'll make cookies together and we'll bake and learn then, but like it's okay to protect something for ourselves too.

Ela Bass (38:49.038)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (39:04.859)
You know, I am a watercolorist and one of my kids loves to paint with me. And I have to be really clear about when I'm available for mom and daughter painting time and when the painting is just for me, you know, because it's doing something different. The purpose intention behind it is different. And I will be honest, well,

The painting with my daughter widens my window in certain ways, it narrows it in others. There's a little cost versus when I'm doing it by myself. And that doesn't make me a bad mom. There's no guilt associated with that. It's just a simple reality that, you know, or I have the same role with baking. I love to bake. I love baking with my kids, but it's different.

than when you're baking by yourself and you're in your mind and you're in the the kind of the physicality of it. It's a mindfulness practice when I'm doing it on my own. It is not when I'm doing it with my kids and I'm teaching them measurements and stuff. Do know what I mean? Like it's okay to protect ourselves in that way.

Ela Bass (40:00.076)
Yeah, that's quite interesting. How do you so like when you're talking to moms and they're taking inventory, so a lot of our parents and a lot of our moms will they already have kids, they're already in the hustle and bustle of homeschooling and and all of the activities and everything else. How do you recommend starting? Because I think a hard part is like, OK, well, whenever you're amidst the chaos, like carving out that 15 minutes initially is really hard or that hour.

Laura Froyen PhD (40:30.106)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (40:30.146)
whatever it is, is really hard because you're like in the midst of it and getting that the momentum that already exists to slow down for a second so that you can catch your breath and like figure out okay how does it need to go? How do you recommend moms especially start that?

Laura Froyen PhD (40:46.521)
Yeah, such a good question. As a scientist, I love data, right? So I always want to start with taking stock. There's an exercise called the wheel of balance. comes, think, out of, I think a therapist developed it. It's something that you can Google. I like it when parents just make it their own so I can describe it for the listeners. Is this going to be a video? Do people watch this on YouTube sometimes?

Yeah, so basically what you're doing is you're writing, you're going to take a piece of paper and you'll write just like a plus sign or an X axis, right? And on the top, you'll, those four little access points, sorry, it's so sunny here. At the, you know, on those four first ones, you'll write the most important aspects of your life. The, your four kind of core values, time with family, creativity, service.

community. And then you maybe would add four more so that it looks kind of like an asterisk and put those in. So maybe you have a faith practice or spirituality on there. Maybe you would have other aspects of wellness like your physical movement. And then you would give yourself a score of one out of ten for how well you're doing on each of those areas. And then so on the actual line,

If you're doing like 10 amazing, you've really got the family relationships nailed down, you'd give yourself a 10 and you'd put your dot like, my gosh, so you'd put your dot way out at the end, right?

Ela Bass (42:28.024)
I think if you put it behind it, it helps too. If you put your hand behind the...

Laura Froyen PhD (42:31.313)
Hmm.

There is that, can we see it? Yeah, so you'd put it on the end and then when you're not doing so well, you would maybe put it towards the middle. So I'm just gonna go ahead and put things out here and then you just connect the dots and it will actually show you where you need more of your work.

Ela Bass (42:35.98)
That's better, yeah.

Laura Froyen PhD (42:57.083)
Sorry, I'm not set up for demonstrations right now. So you can see like, so if this top one is family, we're doing good, we're golden. But look, there's a couple that are sunken in, and that would tell you where you would need to focus. So I did this assessment for myself a couple years ago. And service was what was really lacking, I was feeling really unfulfilled in terms of my service to my community. And I

Ela Bass (42:59.008)
No, you're so good. well.

Laura Froyen PhD (43:24.357)
that's where I decided to focus right away. Luckily, I also have a kid who was really interested in service. And so we signed up to start volunteering at the Humane Society. It is such a fulfilling thing. Absolutely fills my cup. Definitely brings in new things to navigate, but so good from a relationship with my daughter. So like, that's something that came out of that assessment. So I think that that's what you would start just by looking at like, okay, what am I missing?

What is the thing that the biggest thing I can need to focus on? And then finding something that, again, you can build into the fabric of your daily life or into the rhythm of your week. Something that, you know, if you, you know, that one killed two birds with one stone because I was looking actively for something to do with my daughter where she would feel held and known by me. Her love of animals is deep and pure and...

Ela Bass (43:53.326)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (44:04.688)
That's beautiful.

Laura Froyen PhD (44:23.009)
and will last forever. she, I think she feels really loved by me that we do that every week. And then it also filled the service bucket for me, you know?

Ela Bass (44:33.856)
No, that's absolutely beautiful. I'm curious, do you see often that parents are burnt out, especially in like most of society?

Laura Froyen PhD (44:43.313)
Yeah, I mean, I think we're recovering. I think we're recovering from the pandemic. I think the pandemic asked a lot of parents. I think parents who transitioned to parenthood during that time, I think it's really hard. I think it was really hard on them and I think that they didn't necessarily...

They didn't have a lot of the things that we need. And so I'm glad that we are moving out of there. I do think that, so I think that there's some recovery that I'm seeing in the parents that I work with. I think that it's good that we are talking more about it in spaces like podcasts and on social media.

Ela Bass (45:19.086)
Hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (45:32.433)
And I think that it's still, I think that the world, the human animal is not meant to live in a world like the world that we live in. And so I applaud your families and they're already doing a lot of the kind of opting out of some of the things that are naturally big stressors, big stressors for kids. The mainstream school system is a huge stressor for many kids.

They're already opting out of that. But yeah, it's a good invitation. Your question is a good invitation to take a look at, what are some of the things else that we can opt out of and really care for our nervous systems? Because I don't think as human animals we're meant to live how we do, right? We evolved in close-knit supportive communities that we don't have as much anymore. And we also like the technology that we have.

I think is a very big strain on our nervous system. Or even just like driving in the car. Like we're not meant to go that fast. That's it. That's really fast. You know? God, Texas is crazy. My best friend from college was a Texan and wow. The drivers there.

Ela Bass (46:38.882)
Oh, my gosh. Yes, I live in Texas and some of the speed limits are like 80 miles an hour. You're just like, wow. Oh, yeah. No, you just get so used to going so fast. And I mean, I guess that like that's a metaphor for just like daily life, too. Like we just get so used to going so fast. And I mean, especially in the homeschool world, it's so easy to compare yourself and your schedule and your.

you know, activities to everyone else that it's really, really hard not to get pulled into that bubble.

Laura Froyen PhD (47:07.281)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (47:12.593)
It really is such a good opportunity to model for your kids that practice of turning inward and trusting the self, right? Like, you know, okay, so we do have to be out in the world and we have to check in with ourselves. We have to say, okay, so this is what everyone else is doing. Let me check in and what's right for me, for my family, for my kids. This is a beautiful thing to start.

Ela Bass (47:23.042)
Hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (47:43.542)
modeling for our kids out loud, you know?

Ela Bass (47:47.116)
Yeah, I'm curious how you would recommend. like, it would be a lot easier as a person, as a family to say, okay, and I think it's beautiful, let me add, that you just champion this idea of evaluating as an individual, as a family, like what do we need? What are our needs? What are our constraints? How can we live as true to ourselves in this world as possible? But I think it's also very fascinating because

like me versus say my husband. He moves way faster than me, does not need as much quiet time. How do you recommend finding a family balance, right? So like there's a difference between like, and you mentioned like the equity idea, right? But like there's a difference between maybe like say it's a family of five, two people need one thing, the rest of the people need the other thing. And as a mom, you're trying to balance all the needs of every individual kid. And I guess this goes into the...

the neuro spicy, the conversation about the things that sometimes children are very different than you and they are very difficult for you to understand because of how different they are from you.

Laura Froyen PhD (48:58.033)
yeah, I mean, it's such a good question. it's, mean, I don't know that there is an easy answer to that, right? What it is is getting creative and letting go of what we thought it was gonna look like, right? So letting go of, know, rigidly held ideas of what it's supposed to look like and thinking about, okay, so what...

actually does it need to look like for our kids, for this family? So in this season, where we are right now, and thinking about, so it's, think that that, having an attitude of like, well, who says we have to do it that way? Who says who? Having a sense of like,

Ela Bass (49:30.528)
in the season too. Yeah.

Laura Froyen PhD (49:52.433)
Well, we chose that, like we chose this alternative model because we wanted choice. We wanted power. We wanted to say it. Like, so, you know, again, like if we've invested in a curriculum, but there's a part of it that's not working for one of our kids. Who says we have to keep doing it? You know what I mean? Like, who's that? Like, who says we can't alter it? Who says, you know, that we all have to do reading at the same time just because the...

Ela Bass (49:57.122)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (50:18.425)
you know, the influencer we follow has this beautiful like morning basket circle with their, you know, with reading. Who says we have to do it that way? Who says we can't do our reading hanging upside down from monkey bars? Cause we've got, you know, family that needs more, you know, gross motor input while they're doing things that are challenging for them. You know what I mean? Like who, like just like that attitude of like, who says, like, you know, what, how can we creatively approach this and meeting our needs and then helping our kids.

Ela Bass (50:28.993)
Yeah.

Laura Froyen PhD (50:48.251)
happen to compassion for each other. So if we've got, you know, one kid who has a lot of energy and they're in a house full of introverts, what can we do to support them in getting their needs met while keeping the home a chill space of, you know, rest and sanctuary for our other kids? You know, do we need to create a sanctuary for them? Do we need to create opportunities for this other kid who maybe is just a little bit of a misfit? You know, I don't mean I'm

they're a misfit, but just a little goodness of fit matters. And so maybe it's tricky being a kid who doesn't really fit with their family. And leaning, if there is one parent who is more of the extrovert outgoing, leaning on them in the time when they are available to take that kid out of the situation and get those needs met so that everybody else can breathe and have a moment. Do you know what I mean?

And there's this piece of acknowledging it too, like of really just being overtly aware of this is your need and this is your need. What are we going to do to figure this out? You know, mean, even, and this is something that we all, like my kids go to a small Waldorf school. I would have loved to homeschool my kids. I would have loved it. But there was a very significant goodness of fitness match between my oldest child and me. And she really

Ela Bass (51:45.774)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (52:13.435)
firmly needs me to only wear my mom hat when I'm with her. She really needs me to just wear my mom hat. She does not, she can't tolerate my therapist hat or a teacher hat. So it just is what it is. But they go to a really small school, but you know, even like on the car ride home sometimes, you know, one person really wants to listen to music to help them calm, you know, calm and kind of come down from the day. And the other person really needs silence. And so they're like sitting down with them and saying, okay, so

Ela Bass (52:24.172)
you

Ela Bass (52:35.16)
Mm-hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (52:43.377)
On our car ride home, we're having disagreements almost every day because you want to listen to music and your sister, you know, cause you need that. You need the, you know, you need a little fun. need to come, you know, come back out and relax through, you know, that type of stimulation and your sister needs the opposite. needs quiet. What are we going to do? What is our plan? How can we handle that and work together to find a way to meet those needs? So every family has to do that. And

I find it best if they can come to those solutions themselves, you know, because they, know, we've tried so many things on that, you know, so many, we've had so many failures on that problem solving, you know, if we think about failures, know, trading days, trying earplugs, you know, like, I mean, it's just so many and the ultimate.

solution has been that I keep a little music player with headphones for the one who needs music and on those days when the one that can't handle noise or talking, the other one puts their headphones on. And that, you know, but we tried a lot of things. We had a lot of failures before we came to that.

Ela Bass (53:54.146)
That is so crazy and just like so funny that yeah, that's exactly the situation where like one kid needs one thing, the other kid needs the other thing, and then you're trying to figure out the best way to accommodate both needs.

We've been working on accommodating those needs since they were three and five. So, so it mean, and I mean, think that's important for your listeners to know too that like here I am like an expert, lots of extra training in problem solving, like collaborative problem solving. And it took us probably five years to really narrow in on the solution that works consistently.

Ela Bass (54:09.06)
my gosh.

Ela Bass (54:27.448)
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that that makes sense. What are you going to do?

Laura Froyen PhD (54:29.307)
And they still fight about it sometimes too. What are gonna do? You know, can't, because they're humans, right?

Ela Bass (54:36.594)
Mm hmm. If so, my last question for you, if a parent remembers one thing, just one thing from this conversation, what would you want it to be?

Laura Froyen PhD (54:45.937)
Hmm.

Laura Froyen PhD (54:50.235)
To be curious, flexible, and creative with your kids and with yourself.

Ela Bass (54:56.62)
That's beautiful. I love it. Where can people find you if they want more? And also, I know that you are probably a big reader. What books would you recommend before we before I go to that last question?

Laura Froyen PhD (55:09.005)
gosh, I mean, just books for pleasure, because that's a totally different topic, right, versus like books to read. A book that I've really loved recently is for parents of kiddos in the middle years, six to 10 or so. I find that age group fascinating. I think that they get left out of the conversation a lot. So

Ela Bass (55:24.664)
Mmm.

Ela Bass (55:33.39)
Mm.

Laura Froyen PhD (55:34.417)
There's a book, it's called The Crucial Years. It's by Dr. Cheryl Gonzalez Ziegler. And it's about middle childhood, which I just feel like we hardly ever hear about. know, there's so much for the younger kids and so much for the teenagers. So I really love that book. That's the one that's been getting me thinking a lot lately. And then, sorry, where can people find me? I have a podcast. I have a podcast called The Balanced Parent.

Ela Bass (55:44.055)
Hmm

Ela Bass (55:49.185)
Yeah.

Laura Froyen PhD (56:03.501)
And then I, you know, on my website, I have, you can access my membership, which is really where I spend most of my time professionally. So I have a membership where we get together once a week in a group coaching setting, kind of like this right now, where people just ask questions and almost all the people have a narrow spicy kid or a spirited kid. And we talk about, you know, everything that we talked about today is what we talk about every week in my membership.

Ela Bass (56:33.004)
That's so amazing. Well, I hope that you enjoyed this conversation and please go and look up Laura if you want to hear more. And yeah, thank you so much for coming.

Laura Froyen PhD (56:40.529)
Great, thank you for having me.
