## Ela's Production Notes

0:00: OK, so this one was like jam-packed with all kinds of stuff and Charlie, like, I almost would recommend that you just listen to it and pull out the things that you want to.
0:10: there are just so many nuggets in this that if you just throw it through AI it might not pull enough through.
0:17: So just keep that in mind, but We talked a lot about building an education for your kids and like what that actually looks like in practice.
0:26: She's a neuroscientist, researcher.
0:29: She's amazing.
0:30: So she has all of these ideas and she pairs, like, all of the historical knowledge of most homeschoolers, like all of the most famous books and things like that with her neuroscience background and with her research background and her research brain.
0:46: And so we talked a lot about like the, the benefits of unschooling and the lack of unschooling and where she thinks that the best approach, at least for her kids, is a joyful yet rigorous education.
1:01: She goes into what that means, but her perspective is that like, it is ideal to curate a an intellectually rich education, right?
1:11: And like she talks about why that's important to her from a A neuroscience perspective and how she does it while still giving her kids a lot of time to play, a lot of ability to direct their own education, a lot of freedom and choice.
1:28: she talks about like introducing rigor and structure into family life, but like, she's also pretty chill and her approach is definitely, it's hilarious.
1:37: She at the end, recommended two books, Well Trained Mind and Free to Learn, and she's like, These books are technically on the opposite sides of the spectrum, but like they're the two things that I lean on most.
1:50: And I think that's pretty clear through our conversation that like, she values aspects of structure that tie back to Science, like, why is it actually important that kids learn certain things, and those are the things that she wants her kids to learn.
2:04: And then there are other things where, like, traditional school says they're important.
2:08: However, you know, she doesn't actually think they're that important for her kid.
2:11: And if they become important, you know, that then they'll, then they'll do that.
2:15: But, she talks a lot about home environment.
2:19: So she's building a home library, and she talks about the fact that like, she's exposing her kids to certain things and not exposing your kids to other things.
2:27: We did touch on AI.
2:28: I know Charlie, that is something that you wanted to talk about.
2:32: and I think her explanation in that is just like peak.
2:35: It is so good.
2:37: So, pull that out for sure.
2:41: And then.
2:45: Yeah, she, that was about it.
2:46: I think if there's anything else, I'd recommend giving this 11 a listen though, because there's almost too much in there for me to just say, hey, this is like the one thing.
2:57: I think there are a lot of possible clips that you could do and she's so down to write a Twitter post or anything else pulling out of it.
3:06: I think an AI post from her could be cool.
3:10: She has not done that one before.
3:12: And some of the things that we talked about, she was learning out loud and just like thinking out loud, but others of it, she has on her sub stack.
3:19: So, definitely feel free to pull from her sub stack as well, links and articles that you can share with people as an extra resource, but this one was awesome.

## Raw Transcript

Ela Bass (00:00.556)
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella and today I'm joined by Dr. Claire Honeycutt. So Dr. Claire is a second time guest, which I'm very excited about. I think you're probably our second second time guest. And so this is super exciting. If you have not heard her first episode, go listen to it. It basically talked about how you went from being a researcher and a tenured professor or a tenured researcher, just like

really deep inside of your career to deciding to leave it all and homeschool your kids and how that has kind of changed the way that you homeschool as well because you bring your research love into homeschooling and you help a lot of families through that. So today we're going to get all the way deep into that but welcome back to the podcast. It is amazing to see you again.

Ela Bass (01:08.716)
No, I absolutely love that. So I want to dive in to your substack, your podcasts, all the things that you've been doing recently, your writing. Something that I love about you is that you put everything out there for people to learn from and for them to build on for their own family, for them to like figure out, OK, what works for me, what doesn't. And something that like I've heard you say in other areas is that one of the questions that parents ask you the most is.

Where do I even begin? Because when you get into homeschooling, right, there are so many different approaches and so many different people that are telling you, here's the right way, here's the wrong way. Where do you recommend that people begin? And then I kind of want to take it like subject by subject and probably starting with the parent relationship though, but where do you even recommend that people begin?

Ela Bass (02:17.986)
Mm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (02:30.298)
and that like fills your home values and that can be very kind of different right for different people like you may be like I'm a very classical model it's like okay go do you know memorial press or like I'm a very you know I'm a much more you know I want to kind of you know my children to like love and learn obviously okay find a Montessori curriculum or Charlotte Mason curriculum find something that kind of just works for you and just start with that super simple just let someone else make these decisions for you

that you don't really know how your children are going to relate to a lot of those things yet. And then from there, you can start to say, know, math isn't really clicking for us, or writing isn't really clicking for us. Let's go out and look. But then you're also coming from a place of why isn't math clicking for your kid? if you picked a sex in math, right, and you're sitting there like my kid is really frustrated and bored. It's like, okay, well then I need to find a more playful, fun math.

Ela Bass (03:17.432)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (03:28.46)
But I have other parents that they have a really playful fun math and their kids are having a hard time focusing on it. They're like, maybe I need to go to a Saxon. So I always tell people, just start with something. Start with something that's simple. Let a company pick it for you. find someone that you really relate to, that you work through and pick their choices. And be OK that, you know, live with it for six months. And you're not going to ruin them in six months. It's not possible. And kids will

grow and you'll find you'll find new paths for just start and my story for the record is we started with a company called Prinda which doesn't do homeschool anymore so sad I can't tell you to use Prinda but they they do micro schools and they did micro schools and they just kind of held their hand they're like here's the math we recommend here's the reading we recommend here's these this is this cool science platform we recommend and so and we just kind of played around with all those things and not and most of them we don't use anymore but I'm glad we have them when we have them and I'm glad

Ela Bass (04:31.726)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (04:39.618)
Yeah, so let's dive into that. When you began, was there a specific like homeschooling mentality that you were most intrigued by that you were following the most? Did you start that way? Or what was your experience in that? And then as you started homeschooling, the relationship piece obviously becomes primary. And I think something that you've kind of talked about a little bit and we'll go into later a little deeper is building a home culture, right? Like that is the heart of homeschool. is first, there's got to be a culture that you're

consciously building and then on top of that you can help kids to learn.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (05:13.272)
So we, wish that I could say I had this like really well thought out homeschool journey, but I did not, right? We were like COVID homeschoolers, we're like, what are we doing? And so we were kind of learning on the fly. I would say that we kind of definitely started closer to the unschooling model, very self student, student led, student directed kind of learning. And I kind of feel like if you aren't doing at least a little bit of that in preschool, you're not really doing it right. But I also think that it kind of evolves. And I think that

Ela Bass (05:17.518)
I'm

Ela Bass (05:42.734)
Mm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (05:43.249)
what my children needed when they were five and three is very different from my children need now at nine and 11. And unschooling would not be in the hardcore sense, like the radical unschooling sense would not be a good fit for my kids now. And I always say, know, Michael Strong and I kind of overlap in this that we kind of believe in this joyful yet also rigorous education and that it's possible to blend those two things. And so I'm very grateful that I started in that unschooling space because it helped me really ignite like

Ela Bass (06:14.574)
Mm.

Ela Bass (07:02.453)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (07:12.922)
school at home, but her youngest kid had significant anxiety issues and she just like, she's like, hardcore in schooled her and she's like, and they just, they just, her kids are, she's like, they were just different kids and they just couldn't, you know, it just wasn't going to be the right fit. She's like, I don't think my son would have done well with the freedom that we gave her because he just would have run wild with it. But she, she already had this kind of like, I want to sit and focus kind of mentality, but she was like overwhelmed with it. So, you know, it's okay for your kids to be different and, and do a different model of both of them as well.

Ela Bass (07:19.106)
Wow.

Ela Bass (07:40.375)
Hmm.

So let's say that you're a parent that's interested in unschooling because the vast majority of parents at home school that I've talked to recently have actually been very intrigued by the unschool approach. What are some of the things that you need to know if you choose unschool? So like yesterday I chatted with a lady who works with Peter Gray and she's actually saying that that she doesn't like to throw all rules out of the window. But for her, it's more of like self-directed education. Like she opens doors and her kids walk through them.

And yeah, so how do you know like or at least in your mind because you've done a lot of research around this, what are the things that are necessary to think about if you're going into this unschooling approach?

Ela Bass (09:24.748)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (09:31.179)
on great architecture. And it was student directed, parents were taking them and leading them into paths and helping them gain proficiency and perseverance in specific fields, if that makes sense. And I've interviewed a couple different unschoolers.

Ela Bass (09:46.636)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (09:53.303)
The neuroscientist in me also wants to say to people that there are, Maria Montessori was right, that there are these kind of sensitive time windows for kids and that, you know, there's a range for which kids might want to learn to read and it's somewhere between the four to eight. If you're getting to 10, are they going to be able to read? Yes, but it's going to be a lot harder for them. The same thing goes around like rich language development. Kids in this like six to nine age window are

Ela Bass (10:15.576)
Hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (10:23.246)
just their brains are on fire and they just they're learning like they're they're learning like 50 words a day. I mean, it's crazy how many how much they're learning. And it's also a great time to learn math facts and memorize poetry and all those kinds of things, which, by the way, they actually also love to do at those ages. And so you can kind of encourage them to do those things. But if they don't do those things and it makes other things harder later and exposure to like really rich language and like complex language and like that kind of that naughty archaic kind of language when they're young makes really

Ela Bass (11:28.398)
Mm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (11:42.461)
of work with her. just, I, what I worry about is that there's some people online that make it seem that it's just this easy way and you just let kids just float around and that they'll somehow end up in college. And that's just not true. I just have seen no evidence that that's true. Now I will say that there are some kids that that might work for. There are very, there probably are some kids that are just like super self-directed and are just gonna like figure it out. But I don't think it's all kids and it certainly wasn't my choice.

Ela Bass (12:13.858)
That's interesting. So you mentioned joyful yet rigorous education. And I want to kind of go into that a bit and why you say it that way. You obviously appreciate aspects of unschooling approach. You obviously appreciate aspects of giving your kids a lot of autonomy and choice inside of their own education.

But how do you make it rigorous and what is the argument for making it rigorous? Like, why would you actually want to make your kids education rigorous?

Ela Bass (13:26.062)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (13:45.987)
But the question is how long will it take them to get there?

Ela Bass (13:48.865)
Mmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (13:49.645)
there's some things that you can do when you're eight and 10 that are way harder when you're 25. It's kind of like if you want to learn a second language, everyone knows that children can learn second language is easier and faster. And if those children have learned a second language when they're younger, then it makes learning a third or fourth or fifth language as an adult much easier. And if that second language they're learning is a language from the Eastern culture, then they

Ela Bass (13:57.25)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (14:19.578)
will learn then all of a sudden you're opening up Mandarin and Japanese and Korean to them in a way that a 25 or 30 year old can't do. So I really see that children's brains are these things to not fill with a lot of, but to make is to keep, to make them as flexible and as compliant as we can so that when they're older they can go in any direction. Because the truth is, like what I wanted to be, I wanted to be a veterinarian when I was like eight, you know, like

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (15:19.418)
they are particularly interested in. I think that there, when you think about education, you can be broad or you can be deep. And I think you need to be both broad and deep, right? But you can't be deep in everything, right? You can only be deep in a couple of core things. So picking the things that they're innately talented in and innately good at, which tend to have an overlap in the young years, and allowing them depth in those while also keeping them broad enough to want to go in a different direction. My husband is in data analytics and he would have told

do that he did not like math class.

you know, but he didn't like arithmetic, but he actually did. Once they got to algebra and calculus, he it was more logic based and he could understand it better. And so and so if we if his parents had decided when he was eight that, oh, you're just not going to like math and we shouldn't do math for you. This career path that he ended up being his whole life would have been cut off for him. Does that make sense? So I feel that we want to encourage children that sometimes you have to do hard things. Sometimes you have

to work through things, and you have to grapple and be frustrated with things. But we also don't want their entire life filled with that, right? Like that, you know, that you have things that you work on because they're important. And I do think that if you can't explain to a child why something's important, then maybe you do need to question whether it's important or not. But in terms of like, it's like math, like, you've got to be able to do statistics to be able to understand financial planning, which is super important for anybody. If my daughter wants

Ela Bass (17:10.220)
Yeah, no, that makes a ton of sense. So how do you introduce the rigor and structure to your children? Like, there things that you can point to and say, yeah, they fought me on this and I just decided to either keep on saying that this is important or like, how do you strike that balance between like, okay, this is rigorous and I know it's going to be hard for them and it's not enjoyable. And like part of the hard thing, I think when we get to the conversation of

rigor inside of education is the fear that it's going to lose that joy, right? Joy but rigor is a very, very difficult thing to achieve. And I think because of that, a lot of people sit in the joy or they sit in the rigor and like traditional education is like very heavily rigorous, but there's very little follow your passions. Let's, you know, make sure that you are enjoying aspects of what you're doing. How are you doing that with your children?

Ela Bass (18:30.785)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (19:37.739)
and they just do weird things and so you could just do all of that. And so it was just like, what's a way that you can play with words? She doesn't want to write, okay, well, let's make her friends with words. Let's make this something fun, make it a game, make it something that's interesting. And then from there, you know, we just kind of would talk about things. We started, I started bringing in artwork and we talk about the art and she would kind of start to put together these sentences and it was just this, so anyway, it's this slow process.

Ela Bass (19:46.403)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (20:30.358)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (20:51.534)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (20:54.762)
She doesn't really have a strong resistance to writing when she doesn't want to do it. She's just like, I don't feel like doing it today. I was like, okay, you did it yesterday, you know. So she just doesn't have that and I don't have to worry about that for her. So I think taking the pressure off, spending time figuring out how to make it playful.

Ela Bass (21:12.194)
Mm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (21:13.432)
and then making it something that's unique and special to them. I remember one of the first things that my oldest really got excited about was like, we had them writing up reports on animals and it was because she got to pick whatever animal it was. I don't remember, actually the curriculum called for something like that. She's like, oh, I don't wanna write about this. And I was like, well, what do you wanna write about? And she was like, owls. And I was like, well, write it about owls then. I think the thing is when you think about

Think about what it is that you're trying to accomplish with your kid. I want them to be a good writer. often we're not trying to go for like, I want her to be Hemingway. It's like, I want her to be a competent writer. It's like, okay, well then what are the steps that necessary? She doesn't have to write about, you know, boats or that historical thing or, you know, that science thing. She can write about things that she's of interest to her. So you're kind of pairing something that's serious with something that's joyful. I don't know if that, I don't know if that helped.

Ela Bass (22:11.820)
Hmm. No, that does. No, no, no, no, that helps. Do you think part of this is like, I love the fact that you built an at home library or that's something that you're currently doing. And it seems like that's very embedded inside of the culture of your family, just like exposure to ideas, exposure to thinkers and literature and that stuff.

I think a lot of kids see, like as an example, at least from reading your content, Hemingway and Shakespeare and, you know, Dickens and all of these people as school, right? Like they don't see them as just great books. It's like school tasks to be done. And it sounds like in your family, you've approached this differently. Like the way that you explain good books, very different. The way that you probably introduced poetry.

very different than, this is school and like, this is a task to be done.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (23:14.252)
That's totally true.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (23:48.023)
If you're excited about it, they're excited about it. You know, I mean we're we read dick it I think you know the reading thing, you know that was just because reading to my children is just that is just a part of who we are as a family we sit and we read and From the very very beginning actually had to convince my daughter that reading was a good idea too actually So we would be reading to her at night. She came up from school hating basically everything so

Ela Bass (23:50.744)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (24:07.789)
Really?

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (24:17.786)
learning in children, at least one particular child. But it became one of those things that we just, we do this. This is what we do. We read books together and they still, everywhere we go, they take a book. Every time they go to bed, they had stacks of books in their bed. When we are reading, I read to them over breakfast every day, every day. Their father reads to them over dinner every day. Different books. Dad gets the big epics. And I tend to do the Hemingway and the Dickens.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (24:55.768)
If you haven't read it recently, it's like hard. We get to these words and my kids would be like, what is that? I like, I have no idea. So we'd be having to look it up and be like, what does this word mean? What is happening right now? Even my littlest one, she's like, I don't understand what's happening right now. But like it was playful and fun. Like we laughed and we joked. We're like, all right, let's try to play. It like a puzzle. It was like, OK, what's happening? They're like, think they're on, they're on this, they're on the Hudson and in the Hudson they're this

other town and inside that town is this other place. so we were and like we had to read it line by line by line and try to figure it out. And Shakespeare is the same way like we're reading Shakespeare like what are the that mean you like memorize Shakespeare and so it becomes like this kind of fun puzzle that you're doing together. And it's definitely doesn't feel like school like they and my children they have school books that they have to read and we'll have to read as a strong word. They know that as part of school they're to read a school book. But they get to pick what that is right.

Ela Bass (25:55.020)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (25:55.625)
spoke to a woman, name was Michelle, she was also, she's also, we have a very similar feeling about, she's homeschooled all the kids all the way through, but we have very similar philosophy, and she was just talking about how she didn't feel like it was necessary for kids to like force get through a book. She said, you know, let them date a book. Like, let them try out three different books and say, you know, this book, isn't for me. She said, every book that I wanted them to read, I read.

Ela Bass (26:16.590)
Mm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (26:25.548)
to them. And I really liked that philosophy because it's like, okay, we're gonna read, you know, we're gonna read the Iliad, but we'll do it as a family because that's hard, you know, it's like, but you're gonna read, you know, a book that is of interest to you. had my oldest was reading her curriculum said to read this Robin Hood and she got like about she's like, I just don't like it. Like, you know, like Robin Hood, like everyone is right about it. Anyway, but she just like, I just don't like it. And I was reading with her and I was like, I get it. You know, there's parts

Ela Bass (27:01.058)
Hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (27:02.631)
Like, whatever, you know, I just didn't see the point of it. And then she, so she picked up 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I mean, like, I was like, okay, so you picked a harder book. You know? So, and then it actually works really well because she's really into France right now because she's writing, her novel is, takes place in France. And so she's like, oh, there's, and she's just like putting all these things together. it turned out to be the right book for her. And I think, so I think we want kids to challenge themselves in that space. But if there's books that, that are going to be hard books that you want them to

Ela Bass (27:20.428)
That's awesome.

Ela Bass (27:36.402)
I love that. No, I absolutely love that. Now, I want to know a little bit more. Why create a library inside of your home? So like you could have gone to the library, you could possibly use Kindles. Like why create a library of physical books? I mean, a lot of people would say that, you know, if you ever move, my gosh, you're going to have so many books to cart around. Why did you decide that that was important for your family?

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (28:04.536)
Okay, so we didn't at first and we went through a minimalism phase. We have a very small house. We to decide to do this library thing. We literally had to build more like, we had to bring in, we had to buy things. So when they were little, it didn't really feel like it was that, it wasn't as important to us. I did think that physical reading was important to us. So what I noticed when my kids were tiny and they don't need this as much, because now the habit's established. When they were little, like if I was reading on my phone or a Kindle, they weren't interested in reading.

pulled out a book, physical book, sat down on the couch and read it. All of a sudden, I had two little kids sitting next to me reading their physical books. So we had we had we had a decent amount of books, but not a ton. You know, those early years, I mean, gosh, they're just so many books. So we only had a couple that were really core important books. We used the library to pieces. We went to the library. It was every week, every week. And I remember when we first got the library card is like, you can only check out like 25 items. And I was like, 25 items, would ever

out 25 books from the library. It was like definitely us. It was definitely like I think we need more books. And I think we would just let them kind of like pick and choose. Like that was such a like and I when they were really little I would take them to like the science and history section was like pick some of these books you know. And I let them do the early readers and they would just pick and pick and pick and pick. And so I don't think at the beginning like I think if I had wanted to have like an elementary like early elementary school library it would have been like crazy.

Ela Bass (29:22.862)
That's funny.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (29:34.313)
even know that we can handle it. But as they've gotten older, what I noticed was that we went to the library so often that they had really kind of gone through, this sounds crazy, they've really gone through all the books. And that wasn't really true, but they had gone through all of the series they were interested in, because they have all the classics, but they're not, they're always kind of hidden around someplace else. They're not out where everyone can see them. And so a lot of the main books are like the Wings of Fire. They love the Wings of Fire.

Ela Bass (29:54.690)
Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (30:27.822)
Mm.

Ela Bass (31:05.442)
That's awesome.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (31:33.899)
kid doesn't want to read that book or at least in my family like they always want to have a book they always like have to go to library to get more books and and so it's like we'll just go look and if they don't pick it up and they'll and they'll find something and if it's there it's kind of like it's kind of like if you have a bunch of healthy food around your house you'll eat healthy if you have a bunch of just chips around your house you'll eat chips around your house right so it's like what you have in their environment matters and and I'm not saying that don't have the other ones but I think that that's

Ela Bass (31:57.016)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (32:15.350)
I love that. Do you allow a TV in your home?

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (32:24.632)
We actually, I changed this, was it last year? I've been meaning to write a post about it actually. We decided, so we always had like, we watch one movie a weekend. We always let the kids watch a movie on the weekends. But they had been picking just kind of like, oh, we're gonna watch that one again. And so we just kind of stopped. It like all the kids watched their movie on the weekend. And about a year ago, I was like, what we doing? Like, I'm always like, you've gotta read high quality literature and you've got to, you know, read, know, this stuff. I was like, why aren't we, why aren't we,

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (33:24.506)
It's black and white! And I was like, yes it is honey! And she was like, that's so cool!

I was growing up, was like, oh, black and white, can't even handle that. And they just think it's the coolest thing ever. And then it is kind of cool, actually, because they have a picture of the street, and it's all the old-timey cars, and the way the stuff was and stuff, and the kids are just like, this is so cool. And so we've started bringing those things into their world. But I will say that when they were really little, we decided that we didn't want the TV. I read this article about...

Ela Bass (33:53.037)
Mm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (34:07.200)
you I don't want the TV to feel like that's the main thing we do. And so if the room is, if your whole house is kind of organized around the TV, then it's like TV is who we are. And it's like, TV's not who we are. know, reading books is who we are, or you know, going for a walk is who we are, or whatever it is. Homeschooling is what we are. And so when they were little, there just wasn't a TV in the main playroom. And actually we turned, the formal living room was just the playroom, right? It was just hard cores, the toys, was all the things. wanted them part of our

family and to just say this is what we do and yes it's messier like I see people posting about that it's like look at they're so into all the things yes it was absolutely messier it was absolutely more drama with cleaning the house but it was so worth it because now my kids never ask to watch the television never except on the weekends because they know they get the movie but the question is what movie are watching this weekend it's not it's not can I watch TV now it's what are we watching and when are we gonna watch it together

Ela Bass (35:01.581)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (35:37.003)
playing games together. got a, we got a, our dining room, which should be the dining room, is now the, we put a pool table there because it's like, it's right in the middle of the house and it's just basically saying, beckoning to the family, come play with me. We all should come play together. And so I think I got way off of what the question was. don't remember answering the question. But yes, we have a TV. No, we don't really watch it and we don't, and I think we're okay with it. Anyway, I think that's where we're, sorry.

Ela Bass (35:54.730)
No, that's awesome.

Ela Bass (36:05.022)
No, that is exactly what I was curious about. similar to that, do you have any strong feelings about AI, technology, and education? How do you pull that into their education as well?

Ela Bass (37:07.810)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (37:34.379)
you

I will tell you that though we are using Math Academy with my oldest, I still teach her every lesson. Every lesson. I'm the one who teaches it to her. And if she gets stuck, I'm the one who helps her through that stuck. So what it's mostly doing for us is saying, these are the things she needs to know. she's missing that. Let's review it. It's creating all of that back end, which actually is just amazing. And it's so helpful. And I do recommend Math Academy for people.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (38:35.500)
thinking, right? And if you're trying to teach someone how to think, you have to be able to think. I know that sounds crazy, the

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (39:18.586)
how to do it. And you can catch it lying. And it also can't organize. can't organize. One of the most important things when you're writing something is organization. Like, I have this, and I have that, and I this, and I have that. It can't do that.

And so do I think it's going to be useful? Yes. I'm actually starting to figure out, I'm thinking very carefully about how to introduce it to my children in a way that's effective and also that they're a little skeptical of it so they know how to kind play around with it. I will use it with them. This is how I ask it and I'll even tell it, what am I looking for here? How could it be wrong? How do I verify that it's right? And I can say under what categories? Like if I'm saying, you know,

Ela Bass (40:32.448)
No, that is so amazing. you're coming to a, you're coming to your own understanding, right? And like, it probably makes sense too, that like your kids, what you've done and what is very clear through our past conversation and also everything that you shared is that you've been very intentional about what you're exposing to them at different stages of their life and different stages of their learning journey. So.

It seems like it's not as important to you right now to make this a priority because they still have time to learn it. And also, it possibly could get in the way of the things that they're learning now.

Ela Bass (41:35.373)
Hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (41:41.699)
So let's switch gears. We've been talking about writing. My husband does data analytics. But part of the thing he uses it with is some coding. He is an expert at coding. So he's able to create the structure, the framework. He's able to debug it. He's able to catch it when it's wrong. He's able to put all these things together. So it makes him exponentially faster, so much faster at what he's doing.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (42:34.262)
And I think that, and then from that feedback, recognizing that not all of the things it gives you are good suggestions. So like I write, I will give a post to Grok and say, critique this. Now, if I said, do you like this? He always, it always likes it. I love this. This is the best post you've ever written. But if I say, critique this.

Ela Bass (43:14.424)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (43:37.253)
it's most likely gonna get right fine. But if you're using it to critique your writing, you need to be good at writing first. You need to be good at thinking first. You need to be able to like, it's like instead of saying, hi, can you give me a synopsis of Anna Karenina?

Like for what purpose? So you can decide if you're gonna read it or not. Okay, fine. But like if you're trying to understand or think through it, it's like the other thing about a piece of literature, if you're reading literature, it's gonna be different for you than it is for me. There is no one right answer for how you're supposed to interpret the human experience of reading a novel. So, I don't know if that was.

Ela Bass (44:07.288)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (44:15.168)
That is probably one of the best explanations of AI and homeschool I've ever heard. So thank you. Yeah, thinking out loud is actually quite, quite helpful. And I would say I'm pretty similar where you're at, where like, there's just so much that you still don't know there. Like it is such a new thing. Still, you can't even look at the research behind it. Brain developed, like you literally can't. And so

now just reasonable people have to think through it on their own and decide what's right for their family. And I think your analysis makes a lot of sense and is worth thinking through. I also want to ask you, so we've chatted a lot about your home, about your education. We've gone into unschooling and different approaches to learning. It sounds like you're kind of in between this curator role and slightly mentor-ish, right? Like you curate a ton.

But you're also involved, very involved, more involved than the average probably unschooled parent is. So what does a normal day look like for you and your family? And then how do you bring in the self-directed approach? I know you've mentioned that like you'll change their schedule for it, but like what is your outline look like for yourself and for them?

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (45:38.425)
Okay, let's talk about the breakdown of the day first, I think. I actually have a post that I'm writing about this. As you think about curating your day and how you manage your time, I think you need to think about managing your values. Like what is your values? What's most important to you as a family?

Ela Bass (45:56.174)
Hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (46:50.446)
routine so that it's not, you're not constantly having to be like, and now it's time for this, and now it's time for that, and now it's time for this. It's every morning we get up, they have their basic chores that they do, ready for the day. We read over breakfast, whatever reading, and then we do our core subjects in the morning, the hardest subjects. They always pick to do math first, even though I've been trying to encourage them to play around with that, but that's what they do. We do math, we do writing,

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (47:50.219)
open for them. Sometimes they play with friends, sometimes they get into other things. It's really up to them and I try to help whatever it is that they want. It's kind of an Alpha School model in the sense like Alpha School is like you get all the stuff done in the mornings and the afternoons, it's kind of self-directed time. It's a little bit like that except that I don't see the core academics as something to get through. It's more of something that's important to us and that we enjoy and that we spend time doing.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (48:48.066)
she's making some choices in what she's writing about as a more STEM focus, and she's spending a little bit more time on math, but she's still gonna learn the basics, if that makes sense. My oldest, we were doing math, reading, and writing, but then she was like, all of a sudden, she was like, I wanna submit competition short stories, and I was like, okay, and then she was like, I wanna write a novel, I was like, okay, and so it's like, all right, so we've gotta find time, so we rearranged how much time she, excuse me,

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (49:47.883)
rivers, it was, we were talking about flow patterns and, and, you know, and how, and how you think that a river is just gonna run straight down a hill, but it doesn't, curves. And they came up with their own hypotheses about like, about creating dams and how waterfalls are created and all these different kinds of things and why it's actually important and how the Grand Canyon was just like a river eroded that over time and how rivers change over time, how humans have to control it. And anyway, it's very exciting. And they really good time with it because it's fun and it's playful. What was the second part of the

Ela Bass (50:24.032)
Yeah, basically what is the

What is the balance for you between being a curator and also like hands on approach? This is what we're doing and.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (50:45.816)
I definitely pick the books that we read over the breakfast, but they have a lot of say in that. So for example, they're really into Shakespeare. so the Shakespeare company that's here is doing Mary Wives of Windsor and Henry V. And so we're going to go see those. And so we've been reading Mary Wives of Windsor and Henry V. over breakfast. And so while I chose those, mean, really in a way, the local Shakespeare company chose it. And then we wanted to go see them as a

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (51:45.643)
I just can't, I'm trying to, like I thought that they, so recently we introduced them to opera. I thought it was like, I thought I was gonna like write this big post, like it's really hard. And like I introduced them to me, felt it was instant. It was like instantly in love. And I'm like, well I better learn a more about opera now, because I don't know anything about opera. And so I'm like learning a about opera. Almost.

Ela Bass (51:46.456)
Dang.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (52:29.624)
And that if you just show it to children outside of this school mentality, like, I have to do that. Like, my kids never feel like that about stuff. I do think there are some days where they're like, I don't really want to do math today. But I will tell you, my oldest, she knows that if she takes too much time off of math, that math gets harder. And so we were talking about moving to a four day a week schedule because we wanted to add this club. And she's like, mama, I don't want to do math five days a week. She's choosing that. So we're having conversations with her about that.

they get older, they start to understand you help them understand why something's important and how they want to do things. She's had, you know, with her math curriculums, I've been through a lot of math curriculums, but she's been a part of all of them. We have conversations about it. It's like, well, what are you not liking about this? Okay, we're struggling with this. Well, I did a lot of research. And I think this is maybe the best path. Do you think that you think we should go this direction or think maybe shouldn't go that direction? And so we have conversations about it. It doesn't always feel the

Ela Bass (53:35.635)
Mm-hmm

Ela Bass (53:48.312)
So how did you decide what that minimum standard was? Because what it sounds like is that you've done a really good job of having conversations with your kids, making them very aware of the fact that they can co-create this and that they actually do have a say. And then the other thing that it sounds like you've done an amazing job with is creating a culture in your home of wonder for the world. it's like learning is

everything like you're just always learning. was scrolling through some of some of the things that you absolutely love doing. like these are just peak because they they completely illustrate exactly what we're what we're talking about, which is like you have backpacks that are packed for everywhere school. Like basically there's always something and you just take them school books. It's like that's awesome. National Park passes, of course, like

You said turning every drive into a science field trip so that you'll get specific books about where you're going. Telescopes, audio books.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (54:48.256)
That roadside geology thing has changed our whole life. Like, my gosh, that is the coolest book. Everyone should have one of those for their state because you're just like driving around, you're just like, that's a volcano! That was a volcano, like, however many million years ago. It's the coolest thing. Everyone should get one of the Geology of Roadside books. They're awesome.

Ela Bass (55:07.316)
No, I absolutely love it. Like all of these like very practical, small things that are obviously turning your just home and your experience of life with them into something that's an opportunity to learn in it. It is very apparent talking to you that like you love learning about this stuff too. Like even whenever, you know, you're learning about rivers and you're learning about different areas in the world, like there is no world in which we as, you know, one individual human learn everything there is to learn.

And so like to be alongside your kid learning the things that they're learning is just the coolest thing ever. So I love that. Like I absolutely love that about you. Is there anything that's hard still though? Cause I think like every parent has this ideal that my kid is, know, that they love learning and you're saying all these things that you've figured out. Are there any things that you're still working through and trying to understand?

Ela Bass (56:07.470)
you

Ela Bass (56:28.014)
Mm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (56:46.588)
And I'm like, you knew this yesterday, like what happened? And I think that recognizing that, like this week, homeschooling often will allow that, so like this week I knew she was having a tough time, and I'm like, we're just gonna not wake her up. Like we're just gonna let her sleep extra today. And then all of a sudden, and then she was better, you know? And so I think recognizing that those things happen and giving a little bit of flexibility with them.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (57:43.787)
and I can just say, we don't have to finish that today. That's okay.

I do want to tell people that your kids are not going to just magically love everything all the time. do spelling was I think you have to keep searching for the perfect fit and even that perfect fit might not ever be perfect. Spelling we did switch to spelling safari that changed our world with spelling grammar. I love the fix it grammar because it's super short super simple super practical. So it's like what's the what's

Ela Bass (58:07.512)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (59:34.379)
I think the hardest thing for parents, like if your kid is struggling, is to say, we're gonna stop and we're gonna go back, we're gonna go farther back. Because if they're struggling, they're probably not where you want them to be, and you're gonna be like, nope, we're gonna stop and we're gonna go back. And so, and I had to do that with my kid, and it's dramatically transformed thing. So if you're hitting struggle points, don't be scared to, they don't have to get, depends on what their goals are, you know?

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (01:00:20.332)
they can pick up classes really easily. If all of a sudden they decide when they're 18, they wanted to do something in STEM, can do calculus in a year. So with your kids that are with reading, with reading it's just like, just help them fall in love with reading. I after that, I mean, you can read anything if you can just help them fall in love with reading. And read the hard stuff with them so they're learning how to decode it and that's not, I think the thing that's scary with reading is it's just like, I don't know what's happening. And like, I must be stupid. It's like, no, that's just, sorry.

Ela Bass (01:00:28.430)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (01:00:52.926)
I don't know if that was helpful. feel like I kind of went off. I think it's about curating that love.

Ela Bass (01:01:20.140)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (01:01:35.019)
make them better and stronger because they're going to go out into the world and they might get fired, they might have their boss say, oh, you didn't do that right. Or they're going to make mistakes. Nobody goes through, I made mistakes this week. Nobody goes through life without making mistakes. Math is like the perfect place to just practice, what do I do with it to a mistake? Breathe and we try again. And so if things are hard, it's so hard to watch your kids struggle and be

Ela Bass (01:02:09.454)
Mmm.

Ela Bass (01:02:17.358)
that.

Yes. Yeah, this is amazing. think it comes to the core of like modeling resilience for your kid and also instilling it in them as young people, like very different than in a traditional school setting. Like you as a parent can come next to them and say, hey, I know this is hard for you. I know this is really challenging. I'm in this with you. I'm going to try and help you figure this out. But you have to say that this is important for you to figure out too.

And you have to know that you can figure it out. Like this is not something that is just like, un-figure-out-able. Every single problem is something that you can figure out. It's just the question of, okay, how hard are we going to work to get there? And it was really cool actually listening to Janssen Bradshaw, who is on Instagram and really cool. She built a program for kind of tutoring, but her daughter hated reading, hated it. It was so hard for her and she thought it was going to be amazing because

her first daughter got it very quickly. like years into it, she finally started to get better at reading and she's finally started to like overcome it. Now she's an amazing reader, but she was sharing her story a lot and she like, she went to her daughter and she was like, hey, are you okay with me? Like sharing the fact that you struggled with this. And she was like, my gosh, mom, like I'm so proud of the fact that I.

I overcame this. This is something that I'm so proud of. And I think seeing it as an opportunity for that and recognizing the fact that, it's not gonna be fast, it's not gonna be easy, but at some point it can be one of those things in your kid's life that are just very life-defining makes it more exciting as a parent to say, okay, this we're gonna go all in on trying to figure out.

Ela Bass (01:04:13.403)
Okay, I have a couple rapid fire questions for you and thank you again so much. This has been so phenomenal question

Ela Bass (01:04:24.602)
I love it. Question number one, what are some books that you'd recommend for parents that are beginning their journey and just kind of like trying to think through, okay, I'm a curator. I'm like building this education for my child. Where should I begin?

Ela Bass (01:04:47.139)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (01:05:08.301)
Mm-hmm.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (01:05:10.932)
kind of model. And I think that you need both of those in your world. If you want to figure out how to mend those, can come to my website. That's what I talk about.

Ela Bass (01:05:23.918)
Second question, what would you recommend people start with? So where should they start if they go to your website, podcast, blog post? What is one that you're like, go there? And we'll include this one in the description.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (01:05:38.051)
Well, if you just go to clarify.life, right under there's a thing that just says start here and you can click on that and it of gives you the background. But what I recommend is that you can just go to the top posts. So right underneath the start here, there's just a little banner that says top posts and you can click on that and it'll just have all the most favorite ones right there for you. And I will say that if you have anything that you're like, I'm struggling with reading or writing or math, like if you scroll down, it will literally say reading, writing, science, history.

Ela Bass (01:06:12.078)
That's amazing. We'll include a couple of those also just below this episode so that people can find those a little easier. And last question, what is your favorite learning resource right now? Yes, something that you're using, especially because you have access to an ESA because you're in Arizona, right? So you kind of get to be a little creative with different types of learning resources. Yeah.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (01:06:54.678)
We're really loving opera right now. I guess, just all around favorite or just something that you probably wouldn't expect to like that you should probably get for your kids.

Ela Bass (01:07:09.260)
I mean, do both. I'm intrigued by both.

Ela Bass (01:08:17.164)
That's amazing. Well, this has been awesome. Hopefully we can do a part three maybe in a couple months. No, this has been so awesome. And yes, I would highly recommend anybody go and read your posts, listen to your podcasts. I'm an avid listener and reader. So if that says anything, I've definitely benefited from just the way that you think about things and the different perspectives and also how kind you are to the varying approaches of homeschool that there are.

You don't tell people what to do, you just say, here's what I'm learning and here's what's working for my family. And I think that approach is absolutely incredible.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt (01:08:56.345)
Thank you, I'm honored, thank you so much. It's been wonderful talking to you, it always is.

Ela Bass (01:09:00.238)
you
