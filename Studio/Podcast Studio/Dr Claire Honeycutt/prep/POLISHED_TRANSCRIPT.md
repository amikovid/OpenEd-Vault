## Ela's Production Notes

0:00: OK, so this one was like jam-packed with all kinds of stuff and Charlie, like, I almost would recommend that you just listen to it and pull out the things that you want to.
0:10: there are just so many nuggets in this that if you just throw it through AI it might not pull enough through.
0:17: So just keep that in mind, but We talked a lot about building an education for your kids and like what that actually looks like in practice.
0:26: She's a neuroscientist, researcher.
0:29: She's amazing.
0:30: So she has all of these ideas and she pairs, like, all of the historical knowledge of most homeschoolers, like all of the most famous books and things like that with her neuroscience background and with her research background and her research brain.
0:46: And so we talked a lot about like the, the benefits of unschooling and the lack of unschooling and where she thinks that the best approach, at least for her kids, is a joyful yet rigorous education.
1:01: She goes into what that means, but her perspective is that like, it is ideal to curate a an intellectually rich education, right?
1:11: And like she talks about why that's important to her from a A neuroscience perspective and how she does it while still giving her kids a lot of time to play, a lot of ability to direct their own education, a lot of freedom and choice.
1:28: she talks about like introducing rigor and structure into family life, but like, she's also pretty chill and her approach is definitely, it's hilarious.
1:37: She at the end, recommended two books, Well Trained Mind and Free to Learn, and she's like, These books are technically on the opposite sides of the spectrum, but like they're the two things that I lean on most.
1:50: And I think that's pretty clear through our conversation that like, she values aspects of structure that tie back to Science, like, why is it actually important that kids learn certain things, and those are the things that she wants her kids to learn.
2:04: And then there are other things where, like, traditional school says they're important.
2:08: However, you know, she doesn't actually think they're that important for her kid.
2:11: And if they become important, you know, that then they'll, then they'll do that.
2:15: But, she talks a lot about home environment.
2:19: So she's building a home library, and she talks about the fact that like, she's exposing her kids to certain things and not exposing your kids to other things.
2:27: We did touch on AI.
2:28: I know Charlie, that is something that you wanted to talk about.
2:32: and I think her explanation in that is just like peak.
2:35: It is so good.
2:37: So, pull that out for sure.
2:41: And then.
2:45: Yeah, she, that was about it.
2:46: I think if there's anything else, I'd recommend giving this 11 a listen though, because there's almost too much in there for me to just say, hey, this is like the one thing.
2:57: I think there are a lot of possible clips that you could do and she's so down to write a Twitter post or anything else pulling out of it.
3:06: I think an AI post from her could be cool.
3:10: She has not done that one before.
3:12: And some of the things that we talked about, she was learning out loud and just like thinking out loud, but others of it, she has on her sub stack.
3:19: So, definitely feel free to pull from her sub stack as well, links and articles that you can share with people as an extra resource, but this one was awesome.

## Polished Transcript

**Ela:** Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ela, and today I'm joined by Dr. Claire Honeycutt. Dr. Claire is a second-time guest, which I'm very excited about. I think you're probably our second second-time guest. If you have not heard her first episode, go listen to it. It talked about how you went from being a researcher and a tenured professor to deciding to leave it all and homeschool your kids, and how that changed the way you homeschool because you bring your research love into it. You help a lot of families through that. Today we're going to get deep into all of it. 

Welcome back to the podcast. It is amazing to see you again.

**Ela:** I want to dive into your Substack, your podcast, all the things you've been doing recently, your writing. Something I love about you is that you put everything out there for people to learn from and build on for their own family. Something I've heard you say is that one of the questions parents ask you the most is: where do I even begin? When you get into homeschooling, there are so many different approaches and so many people telling you the right way and the wrong way. Where do you recommend people begin? I want to take it subject by subject, starting with the parent relationship. Where do you recommend people begin?

[content gap - Dr. Claire's response begins mid-thought]

**Dr. Claire:** ...and that fills your home values, and that can be very different for different people. You may be very classical - okay, go do Memorial Press. Or you may want your children to love and learn - okay, find a Montessori curriculum or Charlotte Mason curriculum. Find something that works for you and just start. Super simple. Just let someone else make these decisions for you, because you don't really know how your children are going to relate to a lot of those things yet.

From there, you can start to say, "Math isn't really clicking for us" or "Writing isn't really clicking for us." Let's go out and look. But then you're coming from a place of understanding why it isn't clicking for your kid. If you picked Saxon math and your kid is frustrated and bored, then you need to find a more playful, fun math.

But I have other parents who have a really playful, fun math and their kids are having a hard time focusing on it. Maybe they need to go to a Saxon. I always tell people, just start with something. Start with something that's simple. Let a company pick it for you. Find someone you really relate to and pick their choices. Be okay with it - live with it for six months. You're not going to ruin them in six months. It's not possible. Kids will grow and you'll find new paths.

My story, for the record - we started with a company called Prinda, which doesn't do homeschool anymore, so sadly I can't tell you to use Prinda. But they did micro schools and they held our hand. They said, "Here's the math we recommend, here's the reading we recommend, here's this cool science platform." We played around with all those things, and most of them we don't use anymore. But I'm glad we had them when we had them.

**Ela:** Let's dive into that. When you began, was there a specific homeschooling mentality you were most intrigued by? Did you start that way? And as you started homeschooling, the relationship piece obviously becomes primary. Something you've talked about is building a home culture - that is the heart of homeschool. First, there's got to be a culture you're consciously building, and then on top of that you can help kids learn.

**Dr. Claire:** I wish I could say I had this really well-thought-out homeschool journey, but I did not. We were COVID homeschoolers - "What are we doing?" We were learning on the fly. I would say we definitely started closer to the unschooling model, very student-led, student-directed learning. I feel like if you aren't doing at least a little bit of that in preschool, you're not really doing it right. But I also think it evolves.

What my children needed when they were five and three is very different from what they need now at nine and eleven. Unschooling in the hardcore sense, the radical unschooling sense, would not be a good fit for my kids now. Michael Strong and I overlap in this - we believe in this joyful yet also rigorous education and that it's possible to blend those two things. I'm very grateful I started in that unschooling space because it helped me really ignite...

**Dr. Claire:** ...school at home, but her youngest kid had significant anxiety issues and she just hardcore unschooled her. Her kids were just different kids. They just couldn't - it wasn't going to be the right fit. She said, "I don't think my son would have done well with the freedom we gave her because he just would have run wild with it." But the daughter already had this "I want to sit and focus" mentality - she was just overwhelmed with it. It's okay for your kids to be different and to do a different model for both of them.

**Ela:** Let's say you're a parent interested in unschooling, because the vast majority of homeschool parents I've talked to recently have been very intrigued by the unschool approach. What are some things you need to know if you choose unschool? Yesterday I chatted with a lady who works with Peter Gray, and she's actually saying she doesn't like to throw all rules out the window. For her, it's more self-directed education - she opens doors and her kids walk through them. What are the things that are necessary to think about if you're going into this unschooling approach?

[content gap - Dr. Claire's response begins mid-thought]

**Dr. Claire:** ...on great architecture. And it was student-directed - parents were taking them and leading them into paths and helping them gain proficiency and perseverance in specific fields. I've interviewed a couple different unschoolers.

The neuroscientist in me also wants to say that there are - Maria Montessori was right - these sensitive time windows for kids. There's a range for which kids might want to learn to read, somewhere between four and eight. If you're getting to ten, are they going to be able to read? Yes, but it's going to be a lot harder for them.

The same thing goes for rich language development. Kids in this six-to-nine age window - their brains are on fire. They're learning fifty words a day. It's crazy how much they're learning. It's also a great time to learn math facts and memorize poetry and all those kinds of things, which, by the way, they actually love to do at those ages. You can encourage them to do those things. But if they don't, it makes other things harder later. Exposure to really rich, complex language - that archaic language when they're young - makes really...

[content gap]

**Dr. Claire:** ...of work with her. What I worry about is that there are people online who make it seem like it's just this easy way where you let kids float around and they'll somehow end up in college. That's just not true. I have seen no evidence that that's true. There are some kids that might work for - very self-directed kids who are just going to figure it out. But I don't think it's all kids, and it certainly wasn't my choice.

**Ela:** That's interesting. You mentioned joyful yet rigorous education. I want to go into that - why you say it that way. You obviously appreciate aspects of the unschooling approach. You obviously appreciate giving your kids a lot of autonomy and choice inside their own education. But how do you make it rigorous, and what is the argument for making it rigorous? Why would you actually want to make your kids' education rigorous?

[content gap - Dr. Claire's response begins mid-thought]

**Dr. Claire:** But the question is, how long will it take them to get there? There are things you can do when you're eight and ten that are way harder when you're twenty-five. It's like learning a second language - everyone knows that children can learn second languages easier and faster. If those children have learned a second language when they're younger, it makes learning a third or fourth or fifth language as an adult much easier. And if that second language is from Eastern culture, then all of a sudden you're opening up Mandarin and Japanese and Korean in a way that a twenty-five or thirty-year-old can't do.

I really see that children's brains are things to keep as flexible and compliant as we can so that when they're older they can go in any direction. Because what I wanted to be - I wanted to be a veterinarian when I was eight.

They are particularly interested in specific things. When you think about education, you can be broad or you can be deep. I think you need to be both, but you can't be deep in everything. You can only be deep in a couple of core things. Picking the things they're innately talented in and allowing them depth in those while keeping them broad enough to go in a different direction.

My husband is in data analytics. He would have told you he did not like math class. He didn't like arithmetic. But once they got to algebra and calculus, it was more logic-based and he could understand it better. If his parents had decided when he was eight, "Oh, you're just not going to like math and we shouldn't do math for you," this career path that ended up being his whole life would have been cut off for him.

I feel that we want to encourage children that sometimes you have to do hard things. Sometimes you have to work through things and grapple and be frustrated. But we also don't want their entire life filled with that. You have things you work on because they're important. If you can't explain to a child why something's important, then maybe you do need to question whether it's important or not. But with math - you've got to be able to do statistics to understand financial planning, which is super important for anybody.

**Ela:** That makes a ton of sense. How do you introduce the rigor and structure to your children? Are there things you can point to and say, "Yeah, they fought me on this and I just decided to keep saying it's important"? How do you strike that balance? The fear when we get to the conversation of rigor inside of education is that it's going to lose the joy. Joy but rigor is very difficult to achieve. Because of that, a lot of people sit in the joy or they sit in the rigor. Traditional education is very heavily rigorous, but there's very little "follow your passions" or "make sure you're enjoying aspects of what you're doing." How are you doing that with your children?

[content gap - Dr. Claire's response begins mid-thought]

**Dr. Claire:** ...and they just do weird things, so you could just do all of that. It was like, "What's a way that you can play with words?" She doesn't want to write - okay, well, let's make her friends with words. Let's make this something fun, make it a game, make it something interesting. From there, we just started talking about things. I started bringing in artwork and we'd talk about the art, and she would start to put together these sentences. It's this slow process.

She doesn't really have a strong resistance to writing when she doesn't want to do it. She's just like, "I don't feel like doing it today." And I'll say, "Okay, you did it yesterday." She just doesn't have that strong resistance, and I don't have to worry about it for her. Taking the pressure off, spending time figuring out how to make it playful, and then making it something unique and special to them.

I remember one of the first things my oldest got really excited about - we had them writing up reports on animals. Her curriculum called for a specific animal. She's like, "Oh, I don't want to write about this." I said, "Well, what do you want to write about?" She said, "Owls." And I said, "Well, write it about owls then."

Think about what you're trying to accomplish with your kid. I want them to be a good writer. Often we're not going for "I want her to be Hemingway." It's more "I want her to be a competent writer." What are the steps that are necessary? She doesn't have to write about boats or that historical thing or that science thing. She can write about things that are of interest to her. You're pairing something that's serious with something that's joyful.

**Ela:** That does help. I love that you built an at-home library - that's something you're currently doing. It seems very embedded inside the culture of your family - exposure to ideas, thinkers, and literature.

I think a lot of kids see Hemingway and Shakespeare and Dickens as school. They don't see them as great books. It's school tasks to be done. It sounds like in your family, you've approached this differently. The way you explain good books is very different. The way you probably introduced poetry is very different than "this is school and this is a task to be done."

**Dr. Claire:** That's totally true. If you're excited about it, they're excited about it. The reading thing - reading to my children is just a part of who we are as a family. We sit and we read.

From the very beginning, I actually had to convince my daughter that reading was a good idea too. She came home from school hating basically everything.

**Ela:** Really?

**Dr. Claire:** ...learning in children, at least one particular child. But it became one of those things - we just do this. This is what we do. We read books together. Still, everywhere they go, they take a book. Every time they go to bed, they have stacks of books in their bed. I read to them over breakfast every day. Their father reads to them over dinner every day. Different books. Dad gets the big epics. I tend to do the Hemingway and the Dickens.

If you haven't read it recently, it's hard. We get to these words and my kids are like, "What is that?" And I'm like, "I have no idea." So we'd look it up - "What does this word mean? What is happening right now?" Even my littlest one, she's like, "I don't understand what's happening right now." But it was playful and fun. We laughed and joked. We treated it like a puzzle. "Okay, what's happening?" They're like, "I think they're on the Hudson, and in the Hudson there's this other town, and inside that town is this other place." We had to read it line by line and try to figure it out.

Shakespeare is the same way. We're reading Shakespeare - "What does that mean?" We memorize Shakespeare and it becomes this fun puzzle you're doing together. It definitely doesn't feel like school. My children have school books that they read as part of school, but they get to pick what that is.

I spoke to a woman named Michelle. She's homeschooled all her kids all the way through. We have a very similar philosophy. She was talking about how she didn't feel it was necessary for kids to force their way through a book. She said, "Let them date a book. Let them try out three different books and say, 'This book isn't for me.'" She said, "Every book that I wanted them to read, I read to them."

I really liked that philosophy. Okay, we're going to read the Iliad, but we'll do it as a family because that's hard. But you're going to read a book that is of interest to you. My oldest was reading Robin Hood because her curriculum said to. She got partway through and was like, "I just don't like it." I was reading it with her and I was like, "I get it." I just didn't see the point of it.

So she picked up 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I was like, "Okay, so you picked a harder book." And then it actually worked really well because she's really into France right now - she's writing a novel that takes place in France. She's putting all these things together and it turned out to be the right book for her.

I think we want kids to challenge themselves in that space, but if there are books that are going to be hard, books you want them to read - read them together as a family.

**Ela:** I love that. Now, I want to know more. Why create a library inside of your home? You could go to the library, you could use Kindles. A lot of people would say that if you ever move, you're going to have so many books to cart around. Why did you decide that was important for your family?

**Dr. Claire:** We didn't at first. We went through a minimalism phase. We have a very small house. To do this library thing, we literally had to buy things and bring in shelving.

When they were little, it didn't feel as important. I did think physical reading was important. What I noticed when my kids were tiny - and they don't need this as much now because the habit's established - when they were little, if I was reading on my phone or a Kindle, they weren't interested in reading. But if I pulled out a physical book, sat down on the couch and read it, all of a sudden I had two little kids sitting next to me reading their physical books.

We used the library to pieces. We went every week. I remember when we first got the library card - "You can only check out twenty-five items." I was like, "Twenty-five items? Who would ever check out twenty-five books?" It was definitely us. We would let them pick and choose. When they were really little, I'd take them to the science and history section and say, "Pick some of these books." I let them do the early readers and they would just pick and pick and pick.

As they've gotten older, they had really gone through all the series they were interested in at the library. The classics are always hidden around someplace else, not out where everyone can see them. A lot of the main books are the Wings of Fire. They love Wings of Fire.

[content gap]

**Dr. Claire:** ...kid doesn't want to read that book, or at least in my family, they always want to have a book, they always have to go to the library to get more books. So we'll just have books around and if they don't pick it up, they'll find something. If it's there, it's like - if you have a bunch of healthy food around your house, you'll eat healthy. If you have a bunch of chips around your house, you'll eat chips. What you have in their environment matters. I'm not saying don't have the other ones, but I think that's important.

**Ela:** I love that. Do you allow a TV in your home?

**Dr. Claire:** We actually changed this, I think it was last year. I've been meaning to write a post about it. We always let the kids watch one movie on the weekends. But they'd been picking the same ones again and again. About a year ago, I was like, "What are we doing? I'm always saying you've got to read high-quality literature, but why aren't we..."

It's black and white! And I was like, "Yes it is, honey!" And she was like, "That's so cool!"

When I was growing up, I was like, "Oh, black and white, I can't even handle that." But they just think it's the coolest thing ever. They have a picture of the street with all the old-timey cars and the way things were - the kids are just like, "This is so cool." So we've started bringing those things into their world.

When they were really little, we decided we didn't want the TV. I read this article about how if your whole house is organized around the TV, then TV is who you are. And TV's not who we are. Reading books is who we are. Going for a walk is who we are. Homeschooling is what we are.

So when they were little, there wasn't a TV in the main playroom. We turned the formal living room into the playroom - hardwood floors, toys, all the things. I wanted them part of our family. Yes, it was messier. I see people posting about it - it was absolutely more drama with cleaning the house. But it was so worth it because now my kids never ask to watch television. Never. Except on the weekends, because they know they get the movie. But the question is "What movie are we watching this weekend?" not "Can I watch TV now?" It's "What are we watching and when are we going to watch it together?"

We've been playing games together. We got a pool table in our dining room - which should be the dining room - because it's right in the middle of the house, just beckoning to the family, "Come play with me." I think I got way off the question. But yes, we have a TV. No, we don't really watch it.

**Ela:** No, that is exactly what I was curious about. Similar to that, do you have any strong feelings about AI, technology, and education? How do you pull that into their education?

[content gap - Dr. Claire's response begins mid-thought]

**Dr. Claire:** I will tell you that we are using Math Academy with my oldest. I still teach her every lesson. Every lesson. I'm the one who teaches it to her. And if she gets stuck, I'm the one who helps her through it. What it's mostly doing for us is saying, "These are the things she needs to know. She's missing that. Let's review it." It's creating all of that back end, which is amazing and so helpful. I do recommend Math Academy for people.

...thinking. If you're trying to teach someone how to think, you have to be able to think. I know that sounds crazy.

[content gap]

**Dr. Claire:** ...how to do it. And you can catch it lying. And it also can't organize. One of the most important things when you're writing is organization - "I have this, I have that, I have this, I have that." It can't do that.

Do I think it's going to be useful? Yes. I'm actually starting to figure out - I'm thinking very carefully about how to introduce it to my children in a way that's effective and also that they're a little skeptical of it, so they know how to play around with it. I will use it with them. I'll show them how I ask it, and I'll even tell them, "What am I looking for here? How could it be wrong? How do I verify that it's right?"

**Ela:** That is amazing. You're coming to your own understanding. And it makes sense that your kids - what you've done, and what is very clear through our past conversation and everything you've shared, is that you've been very intentional about what you're exposing them to at different stages of their life and different stages of their learning journey. It seems like it's not as important to you right now to make this a priority because they still have time to learn it. And it possibly could get in the way of the things they're learning now.

[content gap]

**Dr. Claire:** Let's switch gears. We've been talking about writing. My husband does data analytics. Part of what he uses AI for is coding. He is an expert at coding, so he's able to create the structure, the framework. He's able to debug it. He's able to catch it when it's wrong. He's able to put all these things together. It makes him exponentially faster at what he's doing.

I think from that feedback, you recognize that not all the things it gives you are good suggestions. I write - I will give a post to Grok and say, "Critique this." Now, if I said, "Do you like this?" it always likes it. "I love this. This is the best post you've ever written." But if I say, "Critique this..."

...it's most likely going to get it right. But if you're using it to critique your writing, you need to be good at writing first. You need to be good at thinking first. Instead of saying, "Can you give me a synopsis of Anna Karenina?" - for what purpose? So you can decide if you're going to read it or not? Okay, fine. But if you're trying to understand or think through it - the thing about a piece of literature is it's going to be different for you than it is for me. There is no one right answer for how you're supposed to interpret the human experience of reading a novel.

**Ela:** That is probably one of the best explanations of AI and homeschool I've ever heard. Thank you. Thinking out loud is actually quite helpful. I would say I'm pretty similar to where you're at - there's just so much you still don't know. It is such a new thing. You can't even look at the research behind it from a brain development perspective - you literally can't.

Reasonable people have to think through it on their own and decide what's right for their family. Your analysis makes a lot of sense and is worth thinking through.

I also want to ask you - we've chatted a lot about your home, your education, unschooling and different approaches to learning. It sounds like you're in between this curator role and slightly mentor-ish. You curate a ton, but you're also very involved - more involved than the average unschool parent. What does a normal day look like for you and your family? How do you bring in the self-directed approach? What does your outline look like for yourself and for them?

**Dr. Claire:** Let's talk about the breakdown of the day first. I actually have a post I'm writing about this. As you think about curating your day and managing your time, I think you need to think about managing your values. What is most important to you as a family?

[content gap]

**Dr. Claire:** ...routine so that you're not constantly having to be like, "Now it's time for this, now it's time for that." Every morning we get up, they have their basic chores, they get ready for the day. We read over breakfast - whatever reading. Then we do our core subjects in the morning, the hardest subjects. They always pick to do math first, even though I've been trying to encourage them to play around with that, but that's what they do. We do math, we do writing...

[content gap]

**Dr. Claire:** ...open for them. Sometimes they play with friends, sometimes they get into other things. It's really up to them and I try to help whatever it is that they want.

It's a little bit of an Alpha School model - Alpha School says you get all the stuff done in the mornings and the afternoons are self-directed time. It's a little like that, except I don't see the core academics as something to get through. It's something that's important to us and that we enjoy and that we spend time doing.

**Dr. Claire:** ...she's making some choices in what she's writing about with a more STEM focus, and she's spending a little bit more time on math, but she's still going to learn the basics. My oldest, we were doing math, reading, and writing, but then she was like, "I want to submit competition short stories." I was like, "Okay." Then she was like, "I want to write a novel." I was like, "Okay." So we had to find time and we rearranged how much time she spent...

**Dr. Claire:** ...rivers. We were talking about flow patterns and how you think a river is just going to run straight down a hill, but it doesn't - it curves. They came up with their own hypotheses about creating dams and how waterfalls are created, why it's important, how the Grand Canyon was just a river that eroded over time, how rivers change over time, how humans have to control it. It was very exciting. They had a really good time with it because it's fun and playful.

**Ela:** What is the balance for you between being a curator and a hands-on approach?

**Dr. Claire:** I definitely pick the books we read over breakfast, but they have a lot of say in that. For example, they're really into Shakespeare. The Shakespeare company here is doing Merry Wives of Windsor and Henry V. We're going to go see those, so we've been reading Merry Wives of Windsor and Henry V over breakfast. While I chose those, really the local Shakespeare company chose them, and then we wanted to go see them as a family.

**Dr. Claire:** I just can't - recently we introduced them to opera. I thought it was going to be really hard. I introduced them and it was instant. Instantly in love. And I'm like, "Well, I better learn more about opera now because I don't know anything about opera." So I'm learning about opera.

Almost everything - if you just show it to children outside of this school mentality, my kids never feel like "I have to do that." I do think there are some days where they're like, "I don't really want to do math today." But my oldest - she knows that if she takes too much time off of math, math gets harder. We were talking about moving to a four-day-a-week schedule because we wanted to add a club. And she's like, "Mama, I don't want to do math five days a week" - no, wait - she's choosing to keep doing math five days a week. We're having conversations with her about that.

As they get older, they start to understand. You help them understand why something's important and how they want to do things. With her math curriculums, I've been through a lot, but she's been a part of all of them. We have conversations about it - "What are you not liking about this? Okay, we're struggling with this. I did a lot of research and I think this is maybe the best path. Do you think we should go this direction?" We have conversations about it. It doesn't always feel...

**Ela:** So how did you decide what that minimum standard was? Because it sounds like you've done a really good job of having conversations with your kids, making them very aware that they can co-create this and that they have a say. And the other thing you've done an amazing job with is creating a culture in your home of wonder for the world. Learning is everything - you're just always learning.

I was scrolling through some of the things you love doing, and these completely illustrate what we're talking about. You have backpacks packed for everywhere school - there's always something and you just take their school books. National park passes, of course. Turning every drive into a science field trip, getting specific books about where you're going. Telescopes, audiobooks.

**Dr. Claire:** That Roadside Geology thing has changed our whole life. That is the coolest book. Everyone should have one for their state because you're just driving around going, "That's a volcano! That was a volcano however many million years ago." It's the coolest thing. Everyone should get one of the Roadside Geology books. They're awesome.

**Ela:** I absolutely love it - all of these very practical, small things that are turning your home and your experience of life with them into an opportunity to learn. It's very apparent talking to you that you love learning about this stuff too. Even when you're learning about rivers and different areas in the world - there is no world in which we as one individual human learn everything there is to learn. To be alongside your kid learning the things they're learning is the coolest thing.

Is there anything that's hard still? I think every parent has this ideal. You're saying all these things you've figured out. Are there things you're still working through and trying to understand?

**Dr. Claire:** ...and I'm like, "You knew this yesterday - what happened?" Recognizing that - this week, homeschooling often allows for that. This week I knew she was having a tough time, and I'm like, "We're just not going to wake her up. We're going to let her sleep extra today." And then she was better. Recognizing that those things happen and giving a little bit of flexibility with them.

**Dr. Claire:** ...and I can just say, "We don't have to finish that today. That's okay."

I do want to tell people that your kids are not going to magically love everything all the time. Spelling was - I think you have to keep searching for the perfect fit, and even that perfect fit might not ever be perfect. Spelling, we switched to Spelling Safari, and that changed our world. Grammar - I love the Fix It Grammar because it's super short, super simple, super practical.

**Dr. Claire:** I think the hardest thing for parents - if your kid is struggling - is to say, "We're going to stop and we're going to go back. We're going to go farther back." Because if they're struggling, they're probably not where you want them to be. I had to do that with my kid, and it dramatically transformed things. If you're hitting struggle points, don't be scared. They don't have to get there on a specific timeline - it depends on what their goals are.

**Dr. Claire:** ...they can pick up classes really easily. If all of a sudden they decide when they're eighteen they want to do something in STEM, they can do calculus in a year.

With reading, just help them fall in love with reading. After that, you can read anything if you can help them fall in love with reading. And read the hard stuff with them so they're learning how to decode it. I think the thing that's scary with reading is kids think, "I don't know what's happening, I must be stupid." It's not that - it's just hard language.

I think it's about curating that love.

**Ela:** So how do you introduce rigor in a way that still preserves joy?

[content gap - Dr. Claire's response begins mid-thought]

**Dr. Claire:** ...make them better and stronger because they're going to go out into the world and they might get fired, they might have their boss say, "You didn't do that right." They're going to make mistakes. Nobody goes through life without making mistakes. I made mistakes this week. Math is the perfect place to practice - "What do I do when I make a mistake?" Breathe and try again. If things are hard, it's so hard to watch your kids struggle and be...

**Ela:** Yes. This is amazing. I think it comes to the core of modeling resilience for your kid and also instilling it in them as young people - very different than in a traditional school setting. As a parent, you can come next to them and say, "Hey, I know this is hard for you. I know this is really challenging. I'm in this with you. I'm going to try and help you figure this out. But you have to say that this is important for you to figure out too."

And you have to know that you can figure it out. Every single problem is something that you can figure out. It's just a question of how hard you're going to work to get there.

It was really cool listening to Janssen Bradshaw - she's on Instagram, really cool. She built a program for tutoring. Her daughter hated reading - it was so hard for her, and she thought it was going to be amazing because her first daughter got it very quickly. Years into it, she finally started to get better at reading and overcome it. Now she's an amazing reader. She was sharing her story a lot and went to her daughter and asked, "Hey, are you okay with me sharing the fact that you struggled with this?" And her daughter said, "Oh my gosh, Mom, I'm so proud of the fact that I overcame this. This is something I'm so proud of."

I think seeing it as an opportunity and recognizing that it's not going to be fast, it's not going to be easy, but at some point it can be one of those life-defining things in your kid's life - that makes it more exciting as a parent to say, "Okay, we're going to go all in on trying to figure this out."

**Ela:** Okay, I have a couple rapid-fire questions for you. Thank you again so much. This has been so phenomenal.

Question number one: What are some books you'd recommend for parents beginning their journey, trying to think through, "Okay, I'm a curator, I'm building this education for my child - where should I begin?"

[content gap - Dr. Claire's response begins mid-thought]

**Dr. Claire:** ...kind of model. I think you need both of those in your world. If you want to figure out how to blend those, you can come to my website. That's what I talk about.

**Ela:** Second question: What would you recommend people start with? Where should they start if they go to your website - podcast, blog post? What's one you'd say, "Go there"? We'll include this one in the description.

**Dr. Claire:** If you just go to clarify.life, right under there's a thing that says "Start Here" and you can click on that. It gives you the background. What I recommend is you can go to the top posts - right underneath the "Start Here," there's a banner that says "Top Posts." Click on that and it'll have all the most popular ones right there for you. If you have anything specific - you're struggling with reading or writing or math - if you scroll down, it will literally say reading, writing, science, history.

**Ela:** That's amazing. We'll include a couple of those below this episode so people can find them a little easier. Last question: What is your favorite learning resource right now? Especially because you have access to an ESA since you're in Arizona, so you get to be a little creative with different types of learning resources.

**Dr. Claire:** We're really loving opera right now. I guess - just all-around favorite, or something you probably wouldn't expect to like that you should probably get for your kids?

**Ela:** Do both. I'm intrigued by both.

[content gap]

**Ela:** That's amazing. Well, this has been awesome. Hopefully we can do a part three maybe in a couple months. I would highly recommend anybody go and read your posts, listen to your podcasts. I'm an avid listener and reader. I've definitely benefited from the way you think about things, the different perspectives, and how kind you are to the varying approaches of homeschool.

You don't tell people what to do, you just say, "Here's what I'm learning and here's what's working for my family." I think that approach is absolutely incredible.

**Dr. Claire:** Thank you, I'm honored. Thank you so much. It's been wonderful talking to you. It always is.

**Ela:** Thank you.
