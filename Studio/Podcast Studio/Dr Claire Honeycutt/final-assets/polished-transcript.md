### Welcome Back: Dr. Claire Honeycutt Returns

**Ela:** (00:00) Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ela, and today I'm joined by Dr. Claire Honeycutt. Dr. Claire is a second-time guest, which I'm very excited about. I think you're probably our second second-time guest. If you have not heard her first episode, go listen to it. It basically talked about how you went from being a researcher and a tenured professor - really deep inside of your career - to deciding to leave it all and homeschool your kids, and how that has changed the way that you homeschool because you bring your research love into homeschooling and you help a lot of families through that. So today we're going to get all the way deep into that. Welcome back to the podcast. It is amazing to see you again.

### "Just Start" - Why Your First Curriculum Doesn't Matter That Much

**Ela:** (01:08) I want to dive into your Substack, your podcasts, all the things that you've been doing recently, your writing. Something that I love about you is that you put everything out there for people to learn from and for them to build on for their own family - for them to figure out, what works for me, what doesn't. Something that I've heard you say in other areas is that one of the questions parents ask you the most is: where do I even begin? Because when you get into homeschooling, there are so many different approaches and so many different people telling you, here's the right way, here's the wrong way. Where do you recommend that people begin? And then I kind of want to take it subject by subject, probably starting with the parent relationship. Where do you even recommend that people begin?

**Dr. Claire:** (02:30) Find something that fills your home values, and that can be very different for different people. You may be like, I'm a very classical model - okay, go do Memorial Press. Or maybe you're much more like, I want my children to love and learn - okay, find a Montessori curriculum or Charlotte Mason curriculum. Find something that kind of just works for you and just start with that. Super simple. Just let someone else make these decisions for you, because you don't really know how your children are going to relate to a lot of those things yet. And then from there, you can start to say, math isn't really clicking for us, or writing isn't really clicking for us. Let's go out and look. But then you're also coming from a place of *why* isn't math clicking for your kid? If you picked a Saxon math and you're sitting there like, my kid is really frustrated and bored - okay, well then I need to find a more playful, fun math.

**Ela:** (03:17) Mm-hmm.

**Dr. Claire:** (03:28) But I have other parents that have a really playful fun math and their kids are having a hard time focusing on it. They're like, maybe I need to go to a Saxon. So I always tell people, just start with something. Start with something that's simple. Let a company pick it for you. Find someone that you really relate to, that you work through, and pick their choices. And be okay that - live with it for six months. You're not going to ruin them in six months. It's not possible. And kids will grow and you'll find new paths. Just start.

My story, for the record, is we started with a company called Prinda, which doesn't do homeschool anymore - so sad I can't tell you to use Prinda. But they do micro schools, and they just kind of held our hand. They're like, here's the math we recommend, here's the reading we recommend, here's this cool science platform we recommend. And we just kind of played around with all those things. Most of them we don't use anymore, but I'm glad we had them when we had them.

### From COVID Unschoolers to Something That Doesn't Have a Name Yet

**Ela:** (04:39) When you began, was there a specific homeschooling mentality that you were most intrigued by? Did you start that way? And then as you started homeschooling, the relationship piece obviously becomes primary. And I think something that you've talked about a little bit - and we'll go into later - is building a home culture. That is the heart of homeschool. First, there's got to be a culture that you're consciously building, and then on top of that you can help kids to learn.

**Dr. Claire:** (05:13) I wish that I could say I had this really well thought out homeschool journey, but I did not. We were COVID homeschoolers - we were like, what are we doing? And so we were kind of learning on the fly. I would say that we definitely started closer to the unschooling model - very student-led, student-directed kind of learning. And I kind of feel like if you aren't doing at least a little bit of that in preschool, you're not really doing it right. But I also think that it evolves.

What my children needed when they were five and three is very different from what my children need now at nine and eleven. And unschooling - in the hardcore sense, the radical unschooling sense - would not be a good fit for my kids now. Michael Strong and I kind of overlap in this: we believe in this joyful yet also rigorous education, and that it's possible to blend those two things. And so I'm very grateful that I started in that unschooling space because it helped me really ignite that love of learning.

**Dr. Claire:** (07:12) [Discussing different approaches for different children] She's like, her kids were just different kids and they just couldn't - it just wasn't going to be the right fit. She's like, I don't think my son would have done well with the freedom that we gave her because he just would have run wild with it. But she already had this kind of "I want to sit and focus" mentality, but she was overwhelmed with it. So it's okay for your kids to be different and do a different model for both of them as well.

### Your Child's Brain Is on Fire Right Now (Sensitive Windows Explained)

**Ela:** (07:40) So let's say that you're a parent that's interested in unschooling, because the vast majority of parents that homeschool that I've talked to recently have actually been very intrigued by the unschool approach. What are some of the things that you need to know if you choose unschool? Yesterday I chatted with a lady who works with Peter Gray, and she's actually saying that she doesn't like to throw all rules out of the window. For her, it's more of self-directed education - she opens doors and her kids walk through them. In your mind, because you've done a lot of research around this, what are the things that are necessary to think about if you're going into this unschooling approach?

**Dr. Claire:** (09:31) ...on great architecture. And it was student-directed - parents were taking them and leading them into paths and helping them gain proficiency and perseverance in specific fields, if that makes sense. And I've interviewed a couple different unschoolers.

**Dr. Claire:** (09:53) The neuroscientist in me also wants to say to people that there are - Maria Montessori was right - that there are these kind of sensitive time windows for kids. There's a range for which kids might want to learn to read, and it's somewhere between the four to eight. If you're getting to ten, are they going to be able to read? Yes, but it's going to be a lot harder for them.

The same thing goes around rich language development. Kids in this six to nine age window - their brains are on fire. They're learning like 50 words a day. I mean, it's crazy how much they're learning. And it's also a great time to learn math facts and memorize poetry and all those kinds of things, which, by the way, they actually also love to do at those ages. And so you can kind of encourage them to do those things. But if they don't do those things, it makes other things harder later. And exposure to really rich language and complex language - that kind of naughty, archaic language when they're young - makes a really big difference.

[Content gap in source audio]

**Dr. Claire:** (11:42) What I worry about is that there are some people online that make it seem that it's just this easy way and you just let kids float around and that they'll somehow end up in college. And that's just not true. I just have seen no evidence that that's true. Now I will say that there are some kids that that might work for. There probably are some kids that are just super self-directed and are just going to figure it out. But I don't think it's all kids, and it certainly wasn't my choice.

### What 8-Year-Olds Can Do That 25-Year-Olds Can't

**Ela:** (12:13) That's interesting. So you mentioned joyful yet rigorous education. And I want to go into that a bit and why you say it that way. You obviously appreciate aspects of the unschooling approach. You obviously appreciate aspects of giving your kids a lot of autonomy and choice inside of their own education. But how do you make it rigorous and what is the argument for making it rigorous? Why would you actually want to make your kid's education rigorous?

**Dr. Claire:** (13:45) But the question is how long will it take them to get there? There's some things that you can do when you're eight and ten that are way harder when you're 25. It's kind of like if you want to learn a second language - everyone knows that children can learn a second language easier and faster. And if those children have learned a second language when they're younger, then it makes learning a third or fourth or fifth language as an adult much easier. And if that second language they're learning is a language from the Eastern culture, then all of a sudden you're opening up Mandarin and Japanese and Korean to them in a way that a 25 or 30 year old can't do.

So I really see that children's brains are these things to keep as flexible and as adaptable as we can so that when they're older they can go in any direction. Because the truth is, what I wanted to be - I wanted to be a veterinarian when I was eight.

**Dr. Claire:** (15:19) When you think about education, you can be broad or you can be deep. And I think you need to be both broad and deep. But you can't be deep in everything. You can only be deep in a couple of core things. So picking the things that they're innately talented in and innately good at - which tend to have an overlap in the young years - and allowing them depth in those while also keeping them broad enough to go in a different direction.

My husband is in data analytics, and he would have told you that he did not like math class. He didn't like arithmetic. But once they got to algebra and calculus, it was more logic-based and he could understand it better. And so if his parents had decided when he was eight that, oh, you're just not going to like math and we shouldn't do math for you - this career path that he ended up being his whole life would have been cut off for him. Does that make sense?

So I feel that we want to encourage children that sometimes you have to do hard things. Sometimes you have to work through things, and you have to grapple and be frustrated with things. But we also don't want their entire life filled with that. You have things that you work on because they're important. And I do think that if you can't explain to a child why something's important, then maybe you do need to question whether it's important or not.

It's like math. You've got to be able to do statistics to be able to understand financial planning, which is super important for anybody. If my daughter wants to pursue something in STEM, she needs that foundation.

### How to Add Rigor Without Killing the Joy

**Ela:** (17:10) So how do you introduce the rigor and structure to your children? Are there things that you can point to and say, yeah, they fought me on this and I just decided to keep saying that this is important? How do you strike that balance between, okay, this is rigorous and I know it's going to be hard for them and it's not enjoyable - and the fear that it's going to lose that joy? Joy but rigor is a very difficult thing to achieve. And I think because of that, a lot of people sit in the joy or they sit in the rigor. Traditional education is very heavily rigorous, but there's very little "follow your passions." How are you doing that with your children?

### "Write It About Owls Then" - Pairing Serious With Joyful

**Dr. Claire:** (19:37) They just do weird things, and so you could just do all of that. And so it was just like, what's a way that you can play with words? She doesn't want to write - okay, well, let's make her friends with words. Let's make this something fun, make it a game, make it something that's interesting. And then from there we just kind of would talk about things. I started bringing in artwork, and we'd talk about the art, and she would kind of start to put together these sentences. And it was just this slow process.

**Dr. Claire:** (20:54) She doesn't really have a strong resistance to writing when she doesn't want to do it. She's just like, I don't feel like doing it today. And I was like, okay, you did it yesterday. So she just doesn't have that and I don't have to worry about that for her. So I think taking the pressure off, spending time figuring out how to make it playful, and then making it something that's unique and special to them.

**Dr. Claire:** (21:13) I remember one of the first things that my oldest really got excited about was - we had them writing up reports on animals, and it was because she got to pick whatever animal it was. The curriculum called for something like that. She's like, oh, I don't wanna write about this. And I was like, well, what do you wanna write about? And she was like, owls. And I was like, well, write it about owls then.

I think the thing is, when you think about what it is that you're trying to accomplish with your kid - I want them to be a good writer. Often we're not trying to go for, I want her to be Hemingway. It's like, I want her to be a competent writer. Okay, well then what are the steps that are necessary? She doesn't have to write about boats or that historical thing or that science thing. She can write about things that are of interest to her. So you're kind of pairing something that's serious with something that's joyful.

### Dickens at Breakfast, Shakespeare as a Puzzle

**Ela:** (22:11) Do you think part of this is - I love the fact that you built an at-home library, or that's something that you're currently doing. And it seems like that's very embedded inside of the culture of your family - just exposure to ideas, exposure to thinkers and literature. I think a lot of kids see Hemingway and Shakespeare and Dickens and all of these people as school. They don't see them as just great books. It's like school tasks to be done. And it sounds like in your family, you've approached this differently. The way that you explain good books, very different. The way that you probably introduced poetry - very different than "this is school and this is a task to be done."

**Dr. Claire:** (23:14) That's totally true.

**Dr. Claire:** (23:48) If you're excited about it, they're excited about it. We read Dickens - the reading thing, that was just because reading to my children is just a part of who we are as a family. We sit and we read.

From the very beginning, I actually had to convince my daughter that reading was a good idea too. She came home from school hating basically everything.

**Dr. Claire:** (24:17) But it became one of those things that we just - we do this. This is what we do. We read books together. And they still, everywhere we go, they take a book. Every time they go to bed, they have stacks of books in their bed. I read to them over breakfast every day. Every day. Their father reads to them over dinner every day. Different books. Dad gets the big epics. And I tend to do the Hemingway and the Dickens.

**Dr. Claire:** (24:55) If you haven't read it recently, it's hard. We get to these words and my kids would be like, what is that? And I'm like, I have no idea. So we'd be having to look it up and be like, what does this word mean? What is happening right now? Even my littlest one, she's like, I don't understand what's happening right now. But it was playful and fun. We laughed and we joked. We're like, all right, let's try to play it like a puzzle. Okay, what's happening? They're like, I think they're on the Hudson, and in the Hudson there's this other town, and inside that town is this other place. And so we had to read it line by line by line and try to figure it out.

And Shakespeare is the same way. We're reading Shakespeare and it's like, what does that mean? And they memorize Shakespeare. And so it becomes this kind of fun puzzle that you're doing together. And it definitely doesn't feel like school. They have school books that they read - "have to read" is a strong word. They know that as part of school they're going to read a school book. But they get to pick what that is.

### "Let Them Date a Book" (She Dropped Robin Hood for Jules Verne)

**Dr. Claire:** (25:55) I spoke to a woman - her name was Michelle. She's also homeschooled all the kids all the way through, and we have a very similar philosophy. She was talking about how she didn't feel like it was necessary for kids to force their way through a book. She said, let them date a book. Let them try out three different books and say, this book isn't for me. She said, every book that I wanted them to read, I read to them. And I really liked that philosophy because it's like, okay, we're gonna read the Iliad, but we'll do it as a family because that's hard. But you're gonna read a book that is of interest to you.

My oldest - her curriculum said to read this Robin Hood, and she got about partway through and she's like, I just don't like it. And I was reading with her, and I was like, I get it. I just didn't see the point of it.

And then she picked up 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I was like, okay, so you picked a harder book. And then it actually works really well because she's really into France right now because she's writing her novel, which takes place in France. And so she's putting all these things together. It turned out to be the right book for her.

I think we want kids to challenge themselves in that space. But if there are books that are going to be hard books that you want them to read, read those together as a family.

### Why Physical Books and How She Built the Library

**Ela:** (27:36) I want to know a little bit more. Why create a library inside of your home? You could have gone to the library, you could possibly use Kindles. Why create a library of physical books? A lot of people would say that, if you ever move, my gosh, you're going to have so many books to cart around. Why did you decide that that was important for your family?

**Dr. Claire:** (28:04) We didn't at first, and we went through a minimalism phase. We have a very small house. We had to decide to do this library thing - we literally had to bring in, we had to buy things.

When they were little, it didn't really feel like it was that important to us. I did think that physical reading was important, though. What I noticed when my kids were tiny - and they don't need this as much now because the habit's established - when they were little, if I was reading on my phone or a Kindle, they weren't interested in reading. But if I pulled out a book - physical book - sat down on the couch and read it, all of a sudden I had two little kids sitting next to me reading their physical books.

So we had a decent amount of books but not a ton. Those early years, gosh, there are just so many books. So we only had a couple that were really core important books. We used the library to pieces. We went to the library every week. Every week. And I remember when we first got the library card, it's like, you can only check out 25 items. And I was like, 25 items, who would ever check out 25 books from the library? It was definitely us. It was definitely like, I think we need more books. And we would just let them kind of pick and choose. I would take them to the science and history section and say, pick some of these books. And I'd let them do the early readers and they would just pick and pick and pick.

**Dr. Claire:** (29:34) As they've gotten older, what I noticed was that we went to the library so often that they had really kind of gone through all the books. And that wasn't really true, but they had gone through all of the series they were interested in. Because the library has all the classics, but they're not out where everyone can see them - they're always kind of hidden around someplace else. And so a lot of the main books are like Wings of Fire. They love Wings of Fire.

### Chips or Books? Why Your House Is Your Curriculum

**Dr. Claire:** (31:33) My kid doesn't want to read that book - or at least in my family, they always want to have a book. They always have to go to the library to get more books. And so it's like, we'll just go look. And if they don't pick it up, they'll find something else. And if it's there, it's kind of like - if you have a bunch of healthy food around your house, you'll eat healthy. If you have a bunch of just chips around your house, you'll eat chips. So it's like, what you have in their environment matters. And I'm not saying don't have the other ones, but I think that's important.

### No TV in the Living Room (And What Replaced It)

**Ela:** (32:15) I love that. Do you allow a TV in your home?

**Dr. Claire:** (32:24) We actually - I changed this, was it last year? I've been meaning to write a post about it. We decided - so we always had like, we watch one movie a weekend. We always let the kids watch a movie on the weekends. But they had been picking just kind of like, oh, we're gonna watch that one again. And so we just kind of stopped. And about a year ago, I was like, what are we doing? I'm always telling them they've got to read high quality literature - why aren't we watching high quality films?

**Dr. Claire:** (33:24) It's black and white! And I was like, yes it is, honey! And she was like, that's so cool! I was growing up thinking, oh, black and white, can't even handle that. And they just think it's the coolest thing ever. And then it is kind of cool because they have a picture of the street, and it's all the old-timey cars, and the kids are just like, this is so cool. And so we've started bringing those things into their world.

But I will say that when they were really little, we decided that we didn't want the TV. I read this article about - I don't want the TV to feel like that's the main thing we do. And so if the room is, if your whole house is kind of organized around the TV, then it's like TV is who we are. And it's like, TV's not who we are. Reading books is who we are. Going for a walk is who we are. Homeschooling is what we are.

**Dr. Claire:** (34:07) And so when they were little, there just wasn't a TV in the main playroom. Actually, we turned the formal living room into just the playroom. Hardcore toys, all the things. I wanted them part of our family and to just say, this is what we do. And yes, it's messier - I see people posting about that. It was absolutely messier, it was absolutely more drama with cleaning the house. But it was so worth it because now my kids never ask to watch the television. Never. Except on the weekends, because they know they get the movie. But the question is, what movie are we watching this weekend? It's not "can I watch TV now?" It's "what are we watching and when are we gonna watch it together?"

**Dr. Claire:** (35:37) We got a pool table - our dining room, which should be the dining room, is now the pool table, because it's right in the middle of the house and it's just basically saying, beckoning to the family, come play with me. We all should come play together.

I think I got way off of what the question was. I don't remember answering the question. But yes, we have a TV. No, we don't really watch it, and I think we're okay with it.

### Learn to Think Before You Learn to Prompt (AI in Education)

**Ela:** (36:05) Do you have any strong feelings about AI, technology, and education? How do you pull that into their education?

[Content gap in source audio]

**Dr. Claire:** (37:34) I will tell you that though we are using Math Academy with my oldest, I still teach her every lesson. Every lesson. I'm the one who teaches it to her. And if she gets stuck, I'm the one who helps her through that stuck. So what it's mostly doing for us is saying, these are the things she needs to know. She's missing that - let's review it. It's creating all of that back end, which actually is just amazing. And it's so helpful. I do recommend Math Academy for people.

**Dr. Claire:** (38:35) If you're trying to teach someone how to think, you have to be able to think. I know that sounds crazy.

**Dr. Claire:** (39:18) And you can catch it lying. And it also can't organize. It can't organize. One of the most important things when you're writing something is organization. Like, I have this, and I have that, and I have that. It can't do that.

And so do I think it's going to be useful? Yes. I'm thinking very carefully about how to introduce it to my children in a way that's effective and also that they're a little skeptical of it, so they know how to play around with it. I will use it with them. This is how I ask it. What am I looking for here? How could it be wrong? How do I verify that it's right?

**Ela:** (40:32) You're coming to your own understanding. And it probably makes sense too that your kids - what you've done, and what is very clear through our past conversation and also everything that you shared, is that you've been very intentional about what you're exposing them to at different stages of their life and different stages of their learning journey. So it seems like it's not as important to you right now to make this a priority because they still have time to learn it. And also, it possibly could get in the way of the things that they're learning now.

### AI as Power Tool: Her Husband's Coding Story

**Dr. Claire:** (41:41) So let's switch gears. My husband does data analytics. But part of the thing he uses it with is some coding. He is an expert at coding. So he's able to create the structure, the framework. He's able to debug it. He's able to catch it when it's wrong. He's able to put all these things together. So it makes him exponentially faster, so much faster at what he's doing.

**Dr. Claire:** (42:34) So I write - I will give a post to Grok and say, critique this. Now, if I said, do you like this? It always likes it. "I love this. This is the best post you've ever written." But if I say, critique this -

**Dr. Claire:** (43:37) But if you're using it to critique your writing, you need to be good at writing first. You need to be good at thinking first. You need to be able to - it's like instead of saying, hi, can you give me a synopsis of Anna Karenina?

Like, for what purpose? So you can decide if you're gonna read it or not? Okay, fine. But if you're trying to understand or think through it - the other thing about a piece of literature, if you're reading literature, it's gonna be different for you than it is for me. There is no one right answer for how you're supposed to interpret the human experience of reading a novel.

**Ela:** (44:15) That is probably one of the best explanations of AI and homeschool I've ever heard. So thank you. Thinking out loud is actually quite helpful. And I would say I'm pretty similar where you're at - there's just so much that you still don't know there. It is such a new thing. You can't even look at the research behind it and brain development - you literally can't. And so now just reasonable people have to think through it on their own and decide what's right for their family. And I think your analysis makes a lot of sense and is worth thinking through.

I also want to ask you - so we've chatted a lot about your home, about your education. We've gone into unschooling and different approaches to learning. It sounds like you're kind of in between this curator role and slightly mentor-ish. You curate a ton, but you're also involved - very involved, more involved than the average probably unschooled parent is. So what does a normal day look like for you and your family? And then how do you bring in the self-directed approach?

---

### A Day in the Life: Morning Core Work, Afternoon Exploration

**Dr. Claire:** (45:38) Okay, let's talk about the breakdown of the day first. I actually have a post that I'm writing about this. As you think about curating your day and how you manage your time, I think you need to think about managing your values. What are your values? What's most important to you as a family?

**Dr. Claire:** (46:50) Build a routine so that you're not constantly having to be like, and now it's time for this, and now it's time for that. Every morning we get up, they have their basic chores that they do, get ready for the day. We read over breakfast, whatever the reading is, and then we do our core subjects in the morning - the hardest subjects. They always pick to do math first, even though I've been trying to encourage them to play around with that, but that's what they do. We do math, we do writing.

**Dr. Claire:** (47:50) Then the afternoons are open for them. Sometimes they play with friends, sometimes they get into other things. It's really up to them, and I try to help with whatever it is that they want. It's kind of an Alpha School model in the sense that Alpha School is like, you get all the stuff done in the mornings and the afternoons are kind of self-directed time. It's a little bit like that, except that I don't see the core academics as something to get through. It's more of something that's important to us and that we enjoy and that we spend time doing.

### When Kids Co-Create Their Schedule (The Novel-Writing Daughter)

**Dr. Claire:** (48:48) She's making some choices in what she's writing about as a more STEM focus, and she's spending a little bit more time on math, but she's still gonna learn the basics, if that makes sense.

My oldest, we were doing math, reading, and writing, but then she was like, all of a sudden, she was like, I want to submit competition short stories. And I was like, okay. And then she was like, I wanna write a novel. And I was like, okay. And so it's like, all right, we've gotta find time, so we rearranged how much time she spends on things.

**Dr. Claire:** (49:47) We were talking about rivers - we were talking about flow patterns and how you think that a river is just gonna run straight down a hill, but it doesn't, it curves. And they came up with their own hypotheses about creating dams and how waterfalls are created and all these different kinds of things, and why it's actually important and how the Grand Canyon was just a river that eroded over time, and how rivers change over time, and how humans have to control it. And it was very exciting. They had a really good time with it because it's fun and it's playful.

### Opera, Roadside Geology, and the Pool Table in the Dining Room

**Ela:** (50:24) What is the balance for you between being a curator and also a hands-on approach?

**Dr. Claire:** (50:45) I definitely pick the books that we read over breakfast, but they have a lot of say in that. For example, they're really into Shakespeare. The Shakespeare company that's here is doing Merry Wives of Windsor and Henry V. And so we're going to go see those. And so we've been reading Merry Wives of Windsor and Henry V over breakfast. And so while I chose those, I mean, really in a way the local Shakespeare company chose it. And then we wanted to go see them as a family.

**Dr. Claire:** (51:45) I just can't - I thought that they - so recently we introduced them to opera. I thought it was going to be really hard. And I introduced them - it was instant. Instantly in love. And I'm like, well, I better learn more about opera now, because I don't know anything about opera. And so I'm learning about opera.

Almost everything I expose them to, if you just show it to children outside of this school mentality - like "I have to do that" - my kids never feel like that about stuff. I do think there are some days where they're like, I don't really want to do math today. But I will tell you, my oldest - she knows that if she takes too much time off of math, math gets harder. And so we were talking about moving to a four-day-a-week schedule because we wanted to add this club. And she's like, mama, I don't want to do math five days a week. She's choosing that.

So we're having conversations with her about that. As they get older, they start to understand. You help them understand why something's important and how they want to do things. She's been through a lot of math curriculums, but she's been a part of all of them. We have conversations about it. It's like, well, what are you not liking about this? Okay, we're struggling with this. Well, I did a lot of research and I think this is maybe the best path. Do you think we should go this direction or not?

### What's Still Hard (Bad Days, Spelling, and Going Back)

**Ela:** (53:48) How did you decide what that minimum standard was? Because what it sounds like is that you've done a really good job of having conversations with your kids, making them very aware of the fact that they can co-create this and that they actually do have a say. And the other thing that it sounds like you've done an amazing job with is creating a culture in your home of wonder for the world. It's like learning is everything - you're just always learning.

I was scrolling through some of the things that you absolutely love doing, and they completely illustrate exactly what we're talking about. You have backpacks that are packed for "everywhere school." Basically there's always something and you just take school books. National Park passes, of course. Turning every drive into a science field trip so that you'll get specific books about where you're going. Telescopes, audio books.

**Dr. Claire:** (54:48) That Roadside Geology thing has changed our whole life. My gosh, that is the coolest book. Everyone should have one of those for their state because you're just driving around and you're just like, that's a volcano! That was a volcano however many million years ago. It's the coolest thing. Everyone should get one of the Roadside Geology books. They're awesome.

**Ela:** (55:07) All of these very practical, small things are obviously turning your home and your experience of life with them into something that's an opportunity to learn. It is very apparent talking to you that you love learning about this stuff too. Even whenever you're learning about rivers and you're learning about different areas in the world - there is no world in which we as one individual human learn everything there is to learn. And so to be alongside your kid learning the things that they're learning is just the coolest thing ever. Is there anything that's hard still, though? Because I think every parent has this ideal, and you're saying all these things that you've figured out. Are there any things that you're still working through?

**Dr. Claire:** (56:46) And I'm like, you knew this yesterday - what happened? And I think recognizing that - this week, homeschooling often will allow that, so this week I knew she was having a tough time, and I'm like, we're just gonna not wake her up. We're just gonna let her sleep extra today. And then she was better. And so I think recognizing that those things happen and giving a little bit of flexibility with them.

**Dr. Claire:** (57:43) And I can just say, we don't have to finish that today. That's okay.

I do want to tell people that your kids are not going to just magically love everything all the time. Spelling was - I think you have to keep searching for the perfect fit and even that perfect fit might not ever be perfect. Spelling we did switch to Spelling Safari - that changed our world with spelling. Grammar - I love the Fix It Grammar because it's super short, super simple, super practical.

### "Don't Be Scared to Go Back" - When Your Kid Is Struggling

**Dr. Claire:** (59:34) I think the hardest thing for parents - if your kid is struggling - is to say, we're gonna stop and we're gonna go back. We're gonna go farther back. Because if they're struggling, they're probably not where you want them to be, and you're gonna be like, nope, we're gonna stop and we're gonna go back. And I had to do that with my kid, and it's dramatically transformed things. So if you're hitting struggle points, don't be scared to. They don't have to get - depends on what their goals are.

### Math Is Where You Practice Making Mistakes

**Dr. Claire:** (01:00:20) They can pick up classes really easily. If all of a sudden they decide when they're eighteen that they want to do something in STEM, they can do calculus in a year.

So with your kids that are with reading - just help them fall in love with reading. After that, you can read anything if you can just help them fall in love with reading. And read the hard stuff with them so they're learning how to decode it. I think the thing that's scary with reading is it's just like, I don't know what's happening. And then, I must be stupid. And it's like, no, that's just hard language.

**Dr. Claire:** (01:00:52) I think it's about curating that love.

**Dr. Claire:** (01:01:35) You want to make them better and stronger because they're going to go out into the world and they might get fired, they might have their boss say, oh, you didn't do that right. Or they're going to make mistakes. Nobody goes through life without making mistakes. I made mistakes this week. Math is like the perfect place to just practice - what do I do when I make a mistake? Breathe and we try again. And so if things are hard, it's so hard to watch your kids struggle and be frustrated.

**Ela:** (01:02:17) Yes. This is amazing. I think it comes to the core of modeling resilience for your kid and also instilling it in them as young people - very different than in a traditional school setting. You as a parent can come next to them and say, hey, I know this is hard for you. I know this is really challenging. I'm in this with you. I'm going to try and help you figure this out. But you have to say that this is important for you to figure out too. And you have to know that you can figure it out. This is not something that is un-figure-out-able. Every single problem is something that you can figure out. It's just the question of, okay, how hard are we going to work to get there?

And it was really cool actually listening to Janssen Bradshaw, who is on Instagram and really cool. She built a program for kind of tutoring, but her daughter hated reading. It was so hard for her, and she thought it was going to be amazing because her first daughter got it very quickly. Years into it, she finally started to get better at reading and she finally started to overcome it. Now she's an amazing reader, but she was sharing her story a lot. And she went to her daughter and she was like, hey, are you okay with me sharing the fact that you struggled with this? And she was like, my gosh, mom, I'm so proud of the fact that I overcame this. This is something that I'm so proud of.

And I think seeing it as an opportunity for that, and recognizing the fact that it's not gonna be fast, it's not gonna be easy, but at some point it can be one of those things in your kid's life that are just very life-defining - makes it more exciting as a parent to say, okay, this we're gonna go all in on trying to figure out.

### Rapid Fire: Book Recs, Where to Start, Favorite Resources

**Ela:** (01:04:13) Okay, I have a couple rapid fire questions for you. Thank you again so much - this has been so phenomenal.

Question number one: what are some books that you'd recommend for parents that are beginning their journey and just kind of trying to think through, okay, I'm a curator, I'm building this education for my child. Where should I begin?

**Dr. Claire:** (01:05:10) I think that you need both of those in your world. If you want to figure out how to blend those, you can come to my website. That's what I talk about.

*[Note: Claire recommended The Well-Trained Mind and Free to Learn - two books on opposite sides of the homeschool philosophy spectrum.]*

**Ela:** (01:05:23) Second question: what would you recommend people start with? Where should they start if they go to your website, podcast, blog post? What is one that you're like, go there? And we'll include this one in the description.

**Dr. Claire:** (01:05:38) Well, if you just go to clarified.life, right under there's a thing that just says "Start Here" and you can click on that and it kind of gives you the background. But what I recommend is that you can just go to the top posts. Right underneath the "Start Here," there's a little banner that says "Top Posts" and you can click on that and it'll just have all the most favorite ones right there for you. And I will say that if you have anything that you're struggling with, like reading or writing or math - if you scroll down, it will literally say reading, writing, science, history.

**Ela:** (01:06:12) That's amazing. We'll include a couple of those also just below this episode so that people can find those a little easier. And last question: what is your favorite learning resource right now? Especially because you have access to an ESA because you're in Arizona, so you kind of get to be a little creative with different types of learning resources.

**Dr. Claire:** (01:06:54) We're really loving opera right now. I guess, just all around favorite, or just something that you probably wouldn't expect to like that you should probably get for your kids.

**Ela:** (01:07:09) I mean, do both. I'm intrigued by both.

### Closing

**Ela:** (01:08:17) This has been awesome. Hopefully we can do a part three maybe in a couple months. This has been so awesome. And yes, I would highly recommend anybody go and read your posts, listen to your podcasts. I'm an avid listener and reader. If that says anything, I've definitely benefited from just the way that you think about things and the different perspectives, and also how kind you are to the varying approaches of homeschool that there are. You don't tell people what to do - you just say, here's what I'm learning and here's what's working for my family. And I think that approach is absolutely incredible.

**Dr. Claire:** (01:08:56) Thank you, I'm honored. Thank you so much. It's been wonderful talking to you. It always is.
