## Priority Clips

### 1. Your House Is Your Curriculum (55 sec) ⭐ BEST
**Timestamps:** 28:04, 31:33, 34:07, 35:37 (supercut)
**On-screen hook:** "Chips or books?"

Four rapid cuts: physical books vs Kindle → chips/food analogy → "TV's not who we are" → pool table in dining room. This is the episode's core insight.

**Caption:**
> She put a pool table where the dining table should go. Her kids are thriving.

### 2. Write It About Owls Then (45 sec)
**Timestamps:** 21:13 - 22:11
**On-screen hook:** "The reluctant writer fix"

Kid resisted writing prompt. Claire asked what she wanted to write about. "Owls." "Write it about owls then." Shortest, most quotable clip.

**Caption:**
> Her daughter didn't want to write. "Well, write it about owls then." @HippyMomPhD on making rigor joyful.

---

### 3. Let Them Date a Book (50 sec)
**Timestamps:** 24:55 - 27:20
**On-screen hook:** "She picked a harder book"

Daughter dropped Robin Hood, picked up 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea - harder, not easier. Great payoff.

**Caption:**
> "Let them date a book." @HippyMomPhD's daughter dropped Robin Hood, picked up 20,000 Leagues instead. Way harder. Finished it.

### 4. AI Clip - Long Form (5-6 min) - Optional
**Timestamps:** 36:05 - 44:15
**YouTube title:** "A Neuroscientist Explains Why Her Kids Don't Use AI Yet"
**Thumbnail:** IT ALWAYS LIKES IT

The Grok "critique this vs do you like this" moment is the highlight. Check audio for transcript gaps at 37:07-37:34 and 38:35-39:18 before cutting.

**1/** Dr. Claire Honeycutt has a PhD in Biomedical Engineering/Neuroscience from Georgia Tech & Emory. She quit her tenured professor job to homeschool her two daughters. This is what her days actually look like:

**2/** "If you have healthy food around, you eat healthy. If you have chips, you eat chips." She ditched the TV. Filled the house with physical books. Put a pool table in the dining room. The environment does half the teaching.

**3/** Her oldest was assigned Robin Hood and dropped it halfway through. Then she picked up 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. "Let them date a book." Give permission to quit - they don't choose easier. They choose what fits.

**4/** On AI: "You need to be good at thinking first." She tells Grok "critique this" not "do you like this" - because it always likes everything. Her husband uses AI for coding because he already knows how to code. Expertise first. Tools second.

**5/** Her husband hated arithmetic as a kid. Almost got pulled from math at age 8. He went on to love algebra and calculus. Now he's in data analytics. One parental decision at age 8 almost closed that door forever. Full episode with @HippyMomPhD: [LINK] @OpenEdHQ

Your home is doing more teaching than your curriculum.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt left a tenured professorship in neuroscience to homeschool her kids in Arizona. When we asked about her approach, she didn't talk about curricula or schedules. She talked about her pool table.

It's in the dining room. Not hidden in a basement - right where the family gathers. The TV isn't the centerpiece of the living room. Physical books are everywhere. Roadside Geology lives in the car.

"If you have a bunch of healthy food around your house you'll eat healthy. If you have a bunch of chips, you'll eat chips," Claire told Ela Bass in Part 2 of their conversation.

Environment design beats curriculum choice. What your kids bump into matters more than what you assign.

Your house is already teaching. The question is what.

We just published Part 2 of Dr. Claire Honeycutt's episode - and her take on environment design is one of the most practical things we've heard this year. She talks about setting up her home so her kids can "date a book" instead of defaulting to screens, and why she put a pool table where the dining table should be. What's one small change you've made to your home environment that shifted how your kids spend their time?

## Email to Claire

**Subject:** Your episode assets are ready + a pitch

Hi Claire,

Coordinating assets for Part 2 of your episode with Ela. Blog post is drafted, clips are mapped, social copy is ready.

Ela flagged your AI discussion as one of the strongest moments. If you're interested in writing a standalone piece, here's the angle:

> "My husband uses AI for coding because he already knows how to code. I use it to critique my writing because I already know how to write. For our kids, we're building the thinking first. The prompting can come later."

Could work as an X thread, LinkedIn post, or short Substack piece. We'd amplify whatever you write.

We'll send final links when it drops. Would love for you to share on your channels.

Best,
Chavilah
