# A Day in the Life of a Neuroscientist Who Homeschools: Dr. Claire Honeycutt

There's a pool table where the dining room should be. No TV in the living room. Dickens over breakfast, the Iliad over dinner. And somewhere between Shakespeare memorization and a geology book cracked open in the back seat, two girls - ages 9 and 11 - are getting an education that doesn't have a name yet.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt holds a joint PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech and Emory, specializing in neuroscience. She won multiple teaching awards, earned tenure, and then quit. ("I got tenure so they couldn't fire me, so I quit.") Now she homeschools full-time and runs [ClarifiEd](https://clarified.life/), helping parents become better teachers at home.

This is Claire's second time on the OpenEd Podcast. If you missed her first episode - [What Neuroscience Can Teach Us About Homeschooling](https://opened.co/blog/what-neuroscience-tells-us-about-homeschooling-dr-claire-honeycutt) - she covers the neuroscience of why handwriting beats typing, what Shakespeare does to young brains, and why she walked away from a tenured position. This time, she walked us through what her days actually look like.

## From Unschooler to Something New

Claire didn't arrive at her current approach with a master plan. "I wish that I could say I had this like really well thought out homeschool journey, but I did not, right? We were like COVID homeschoolers, we're like, what are we doing?"

She started closer to unschooling - student-led, student-directed learning. It fit when her kids were three and five. It stopped fitting around nine and eleven. "Unschooling would not be in the hardcore sense, like the radical unschooling sense would not be a good fit for my kids now."

The neuroscientist in her can tell you why. There are sensitive developmental windows - Maria Montessori was right about that. Kids in the six-to-nine age range are learning roughly 50 words a day. "Their brains are on fire," Claire says. Reading, math facts, memorization, rich language exposure - these all have windows. Missing them doesn't make things impossible, but it makes them dramatically harder.

So she landed somewhere she shares with thinker Michael Strong: "joyful yet also rigorous education." Two words that most people treat as opposites. Claire treats them as a pair.

## The Morning

Core subjects happen in the morning, when everyone's sharpest. Math comes first - always. "They always pick to do math first, even though I've been trying to encourage them to play around with that, but that's what they do."

For her oldest, that means [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) - an AI-powered platform developed by Justin Skycak that we covered in our [Best Homeschool Math Curriculum](https://opened.co/blog/best-homeschool-math-curriculum) guide and our [honest assessment of AI tutoring](https://opened.co/blog/ai-tutors-homeschool). But Claire teaches every lesson herself. "I still teach her every lesson. Every lesson. I'm the one who teaches it to her." The platform handles the back end - sequencing, review, gap identification. Claire handles the front end, which is the relationship between a mother and a daughter working through something hard together.

Writing follows math, and Claire learned early to let go of the assigned topic. Her oldest once resisted a writing prompt. "She's like, oh, I don't wanna write about this. And I was like, well, what do you wanna write about? And she was like, owls. And I was like, well, write it about owls then." The goal was competent writing, not compliance. The owls got them there.

Then there's breakfast reading. Claire reads aloud to her girls every morning - Hemingway, Dickens - while their father takes the dinner slot with bigger epics. Different books at every meal, every day.

Reading Dickens as a family turns out to be an exercise in shared confusion. "We get to these words and my kids would be like, what is that? I like, I have no idea. So we'd be having to look it up and be like, what does this word mean? What is happening right now?" They'd work through it line by line, like solving a puzzle. Shakespeare gets the same treatment - memorized, decoded, laughed over. "It definitely doesn't feel like school."

## The House Is the Curriculum

If you spend enough time listening to Claire, you realize the environment matters more than any program she's bought. The house itself teaches.

It started with a small observation when the kids were little - one that tracks with [research on print vs. screens](https://opened.co/blog/print-books-beat-screens-for-memory). "If I was reading on my phone or a Kindle, they weren't interested in reading. But if I pulled out a book, physical book, sat down on the couch and read it. All of a sudden, I had two little kids sitting next to me reading their physical books."

So the family built a home library. Physical books everywhere. And they made a deliberate choice about the living room: no TV at the center of the house. "If your whole house is kind of organized around the TV, then it's like TV is who we are. And it's like, TV's not who we are. Reading books is who we are."

Claire frames it like nutrition. "If you have a bunch of healthy food around your house you'll eat healthy. If you have a bunch of just chips around your house you'll eat chips. What you have in their environment matters."

The pool table sits in the dining room "because it's like, it's right in the middle of the house and it's just basically saying, beckoning to the family, come play with me." Backpacks stay packed for what Claire calls "everywhere school." A copy of Roadside Geology rides in the car - "That roadside geology thing has changed our whole life. You're just like driving around, you're just like, that's a volcano!"

Weekend movie night shifted recently too. The kids had been rewatching the same films, so Claire introduced classic black-and-white movies. Her daughter's response: "It's black and white! That's so cool!" And most recently, opera - which Claire expected to be a hard sell. "I thought I was gonna like write this big post, like it's really hard. And like I introduced them to me, felt it was instant. It was like instantly in love. And I'm like, well I better learn more about opera now, because I don't know anything about opera."

## Let Them Date a Book

Claire borrowed an idea from a friend named Michelle: "Let them date a book. Like, let them try out three different books and say, you know, this book isn't for me."

Her oldest was assigned Robin Hood and couldn't stand it. Claire didn't push it. The girl picked up 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea instead. "I was like, okay, so you picked a harder book." It turned out to be the right fit - her oldest is writing a novel set in France and started connecting Verne's world to her own project.

The hard books - the Iliad, Shakespeare, Dickens - those get read together as a family. "Every book that I wanted them to read, I read to them," as Michelle puts it. That way the challenge is shared, and nobody feels stupid for not knowing a word.

## The Afternoon

After morning academics, the rest of the day opens up. Kids play, explore, pursue whatever they're drawn to. Claire compares it loosely to the Alpha School model - structured mornings, self-directed afternoons - but draws a clear line: "I don't see the core academics as something to get through. It's more of something that's important to us and that we enjoy and that we spend time doing."

Her two daughters have started to diverge. The oldest is writing competition short stories and a novel. The younger one leans more toward STEM, spending extra time on math and choosing science-focused writing topics. Claire adjusts the schedule around them, not the other way around.

## What's Still Hard

Claire is honest about the bad days. "I do want to tell people that your kids are not going to just magically love everything all the time."

There are mornings where her daughter can't do something she could do yesterday. "And I'm like, you knew this yesterday, like what happened?" The flexibility of homeschooling helps - sometimes Claire just lets her sleep in, and the problem resolves itself.

Spelling was a real struggle until they found Spelling Safari. Grammar got easier with Fix It Grammar - "super short, super simple, super practical." But some things stay hard, and Claire thinks that's fine. Math especially. "Math is like the perfect place to just practice, what do I do when I make a mistake? Breathe and we try again."

And sometimes the answer is to go backward. "I think the hardest thing for parents, like if your kid is struggling, is to say, we're gonna stop and we're gonna go back, we're gonna go farther back. Because if they're struggling, they're probably not where you want them to be."

## The Paradox

When asked for book recommendations, Claire names two: *Well-Trained Mind* by Susan Wise Bauer and *Free to Learn* by Peter Gray. They sit on opposite ends of the homeschool philosophy spectrum - one [structured and classical](https://opened.co/blog/classical-education), the other radically child-led. "I think you need both of those in your world."

That's Claire in a sentence. A neuroscientist who reads Dickens over breakfast and lets her kid drop Robin Hood. A former tenured professor who puts a pool table in the dining room. Rigorous and joyful, structured and free - and convinced you don't have to choose.
