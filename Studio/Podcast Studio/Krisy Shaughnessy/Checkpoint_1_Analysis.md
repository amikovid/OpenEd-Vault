## 5 Big Ideas (Potential Marketing Angles)

### 1. The Wonder Wall ⭐ STRONGEST
Sticky notes on a wall to capture curiosity questions. Kids pick one during homeschool time, grab a notebook, research together. Validates questions without requiring immediate answers.

**Key quote:** "As a mom you get asked why this, how does this work a million times a day. And there's something about it that it's always at the least convenient time possible to actually answer that question."

---

### 2. Hiding Vegetables in Education
Kids played Prodigy thinking it was a gaming privilege. Never framed as "math time."

**Key quote:** "It's kind of like when you put vegetables in food. Like there's some veggies you can blend up that's totally unnoticeable. You don't need to tell them that the veggies are in there."

---

### 3. "Be the Villager"
Started Nature School by just picking a park and sending an email every week. Community forms around consistency.

**Key quote:** "So often we talk about that it takes a village to raise a kid, but then we're like, well, where's the village? I heard a quote that said, if you wanna be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager."

---

### 4. Bad Day vs. Not Working
Pattern observation over time. One meltdown isn't signal to change curriculum.

**Key quote:** "If they're not seeing progress, that's the problem."

---

### 5. Trust Yourself
Who knows your kid better? Who loves them more?

**Key quote:** "They're never gonna love your kid the way you love your kid."

## Quote Bank (Verbatim)

### On Boredom & Curiosity
> "Sometimes they are just sitting like on the couch looking like they're totally zoned out and so it might not seem like they're using it well, but when I've talked to them and checked in with them to see what's going on, they're thinking about things and I think that there's such a value to some boredom."

> "When we pulled them out, curiosity came back and they were like, oh, what do I wanna learn about?"

### On Community
> "If you wanna be part of the village, you have to be willing to be the villager."

> "All it took was because I was the one who threw the idea out, I got put in charge of being the person who did it. I would just pick a random park each week and say, we're meeting here."

### On Hiding Education
> "We never really framed it as a math thing. We kind of did just say like, Hey, do you wanna play Prodigy?"

> "They thought it was a special privilege that they were getting extra screen time and they didn't realize that they were just solving math equations."

### On Confidence
> "Trust yourself. Those doubts are so normal... who is more invested in your kid than you and who knows your kid better than you?"

### On What Works
> "If they're not seeing progress, that's the problem."

> "The relationship and the connection is the priority and everything else seems to just work out."

## CHECKPOINT 1: DECISION POINT

**Recommended angle for Day in the Life:** Lead with the Wonder Wall as the central hook, weave in the daily rhythm around it.

**Questions before proceeding:**
1. Is Wonder Wall the right lead, or should we lead with something else?
2. Any sections to cut or expand?
3. Tone check: Should this feel more "polished mom blogger" or more "casual friend sharing"?
