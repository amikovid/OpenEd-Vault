## The Story Arc

### **[SETUP]** The Assumption That Shaped a Life

Joshua Fields Millburn grew up poor in a public school system he describes as "adequate for most people." He wasn't the type to wait to raise his hand. Standardized testing didn't work for him. His test scores looked like they belonged to someone struggling, even though he was relatively bright.

"I got a lot of detentions, mostly for not turning in homework," he recalls. By senior year, he tried to drop out entirely. His guidance counselor, Mr. Day, worked out a deal: one last class for one semester, then he didn't even have to show up. "I even failed at dropping out of high school."

Through all of it, one thing seemed clear to Joshua: reading was just really difficult. That's how it was for everyone, right?

### **[DISASTER]** The Daughter Who Couldn't Hide It

Fast forward decades. Joshua has a daughter, Ella. She's athletic, easygoing, social. But when it comes to school - a good school, a Spanish immersion program in Missoula, Montana - something is wrong.

"She would come home with stomach aches. She'd have stomach aches in the morning with the anxiety of going and being forced to try to read."

The system that had been merely uncomfortable for Joshua was making his daughter miserable. Every time she was told to sit down and focus, it fell apart. Labels started getting thrown around: ADHD. Dyslexia.

### **[FAILED APPROACH]** Trying to Fix It From the Inside

They tried several things within the system. Different approaches. Working with the school. It still didn't work.

"What we're doing right now doesn't work. We've tried several things within the system and it still doesn't work."

The question became: Is the answer a different school? Private school? Tutoring? Homeschool? They started researching, looking for the next best path forward.

### **[INSIGHT]** The Test That Changed Everything

Then came the dyslexia tests.

Ella took them. And Joshua - now about 40 years old - took them alongside her.

"I didn't realize until I had a daughter that I was dyslexic. I mean, she was struggling to read. I'm like, well, yeah, reading is just really hard, right? And they're like, no."

Oh.

For four decades, Joshua had walked through the world assuming his experience was universal. That the struggle was normal. That everyone felt this way about words on a page. He never knew he had what some call "a disease or problem or malfunction in the brain."

But here's the thing: not knowing had given him something. "I just assumed that reading was really difficult, but it actually made me love writing in a way. I got to play with the words and piece them together. And so it became a strange sort of superpower."

### **[RESOLUTION]** Removing the Desks

They found an unschool in Southern California. A husband and wife had bought an old school building the town wasn't using anymore. The first thing they did was remove all the desks.

"So effectively it's like going to a school place, but there is no school."

There's a recording studio. Band instruments. An art room. A bug room. Gardens where she learns to farm. Kids ages 6 to 16 all in the same space, teaching each other. Ella, now 12, is making films - just because she's interested in trying it out.

"I find that the self-directed learning, she's able to delight herself in a way that she was never delighted by the public school system. I haven't seen much in way of downsides yet for her specifically."

The stomach aches are gone.

### **[REFLECTION]** There Are No Shoulds, Only Coulds

When Isaac asked Joshua how parents should combat the panic - the fear that they're missing something, that their kid should be learning to code, should be doing more - Joshua's answer cut through it all:

"There are no shoulds, there are only coulds. Should my daughter be enrolled in a sport? Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she learn an instrument? Should she take calculus at some point? No, there are no shoulds with respect to education. There are only coulds."

The question isn't what society dictates. It's what compels her. When you're compelled by something, time behaves differently. "All of a sudden the time is just soaking the table because there's so much immersion when you're interested in something."

This is minimalism applied to education. The same philosophy that helps people clear 300,000 items from their homes applies to learning: clutter is anything that gets in the way.

"For my daughter, the public school system was a type of clutter. Standardized testing was a type of clutter. It was getting in the way of her life, of her joy, of her peace."

And the deepest insight of all: "Joy cannot be acquired. Peace cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered. It's buried beneath the clutter."

Joshua spent 40 years not knowing what was "wrong" with him. Maybe nothing was. Maybe the environment was the mismatch, not the brain. What we label as weakness might just be a misread context - a coffee grinder in the bed instead of on the counter.

## The Universal Takeaway

Sometimes the thing you've been treating as a personal failing is actually a mismatch between you and your environment. The diagnosis doesn't have to become an identity. The label can be useful without being defining.

And sometimes the breakthrough isn't adding more - more tutoring, more intervention, more shoulds. Sometimes it's removing what's in the way.
