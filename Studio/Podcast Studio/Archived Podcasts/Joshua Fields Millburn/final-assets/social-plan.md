## Long-Form YouTube Clips (Clips 1 & 5)

### Clip 1: "Should My Kid Learn to Code?" Wrong Question.

**Alt title:** Stop "Shoulding" On Your Kids | Joshua Fields Millburn

**Duration:** 6:53
**Descript:** [Link](https://share.descript.com/view/BYq3vKEO7bV)

**Description:**
```
"Should my kid learn to code?" Wrong question.

Joshua Fields Millburn of The Minimalists shares the parenting philosophy that changed everything for his daughter: there are no "shoulds," only "coulds."

When you stop asking what your kid should learn and start asking what compels them, time behaves differently. In a boring classroom, every minute drags. When you're immersed in something you care about, two hours disappear.

Full conversation with OpenEd CEO Isaac Morehouse.

### Clip 5: "Competition Is a Mental Illness" | Joshua Fields Millburn

**Duration:** 5:48
**Descript:** [Link](https://share.descript.com/view/palKQrpfOcA)

**Description:**
```
"Competition is a mental illness."

Joshua Fields Millburn of The Minimalists explains why achievement culture is just consumerism in disguise - and why we're all signing contracts to be discontented.

The prestigious kindergarten. The "right" college. Valedictorian. It's all the same trap: thinking happiness is out there and can be acquired.

"Joy cannot be acquired. It can only be uncovered."

"Would you ever give your kids fentanyl?"

### Clip 4: Entryway Rule (Most Practical)

**On-screen hook:** "The entryway rule"

**Caption:**
```
Phones stay at the door.

@joshuafieldsmillburn calls it the entryway rule. You're not deprived - distractions just don't follow you around.

The bedroom? Worst place for a phone.

"There are no shoulds, there are only coulds."

Joshua Fields Millburn of The Minimalists told us this when we asked how parents should combat the panic - the fear that their kid should be learning to code, should be doing more.

Should my daughter learn karate? Should she dance? Should she take calculus?

No. There are no shoulds with respect to education. Only coulds. The question is: is she compelled by any of them?

His daughter is dyslexic. She was miserable in public school - stomach aches every morning. Now she's 12, thriving in an unschool environment, making films because she's interested.

The difference? They stopped asking what she should learn and started asking what compelled her.

Joshua defines clutter as anything that gets in the way. For his daughter, traditional school had become clutter. Removing it cleared the path.

I've known Joshua Fields Millburn for years.

When his dyslexic daughter started coming home with stomach aches every morning from traditional school, he did what any minimalist would: he asked what needed to go.

We finally sat down to record a conversation about education. What surprised me wasn't the philosophy - it was how precise his thinking has become.

"There are no shoulds. Only coulds."

Should she learn karate? Calculus? An instrument? Wrong question. The question is: what compels her?

The ancient Greeks had a word for what's broken in achievement culture: pleonexia. Greed for things that can be counted. Grades. Credits. Test scores. All measurable. None measuring what matters.

Joshua's daughter is thriving now. Teaching six-year-olds and learning from sixteen-year-olds.

Three things that stuck with me:

1. Clutter isn't stuff. It's anything in the way.
2. Joy can't be acquired. It can only be uncovered.
3. Competition for achievement is "signing a contract to be discontented until you get the thing you want."

Finally recorded this conversation with my old friend @joshuafieldsmillburn.

We talked screens, achievement culture, and why "there are no shoulds."

His fentanyl analogy for screens is worth the click alone.

### Entryway Rule Clip

```
One rule worth trying tonight:

Joshua Fields Millburn and his wife keep their phones at the door. They call it the entryway rule.

"I can still use it like a home phone. I'm not deprived. But the distractions don't follow me around the house."

The bedroom? "The worst place for a phone."
