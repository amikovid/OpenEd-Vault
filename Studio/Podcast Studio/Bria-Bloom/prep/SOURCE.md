## Guest Info / Relevant Context


### Ela’s Notes: 

0:00: Hello, hello.
0:01: OK.
0:01: So, today's podcast with Bria was on self-directed education and she offered a really amazing perspective because she centered self-directed directed education as a thing that is primarily, stemming from the parent-child relationship.
0:20: So, like, there's not one way to do a self-directed education, and I think that that's kind of the misconception is that self-directed education means kid can do whatever they want, parent is not involved, very similar to unschooling, and just like that approach of Kid chooses everything, and there's very little parent involvement, whereas, Instead, her approach is basically that it starts with a parent-child relationship and the goal is to build trust between you two, but then also to act as a, almost like a door opener.
0:58: Like as a parent, you open every door that you can.
1:01: And as a child, they get to choose which ones they're going to go through.
1:04: You can nudge them if you've earned that level of trust with them, especially, but you don't fear monger, you don't tell them that they have to do a ton of things.
1:13: She also creates this distinction between like, as a parent, there are going to be some things that are just like really important to you, and your family.
1:21: So, like, she doesn't find anything wrong with saying, hey, in our family, there are a couple of things that are really important.
1:27: And just setting that as a standard, but it was basically like, set standards, open doors for your kids, use your relationship as a thing that helps you to gauge whether or not they're on track and, Mostly happy, like, are they happy in their situation?
1:47: And then continue seeing if you can find new opportunities for them if they're not, or if you see that there are ways that they could develop more, And she actually sends her kid to a 5 day a week school.
2:01: So, it's like a self-directed education school, but like, pretty cool that she's not 100% just, you know.
2:10: There's one way to do self-directed learning.
2:12: It is at home, parent-driven or kid-driven, and, yeah.
2:20: One other thing that she mentioned that I think would be good to also note is that when we're working on the self-directed education.
2:29: , blog post, if you haven't finished that already.
2:33: Her, Peter Gray, and Ken Danforth together have like a really unique perspective.
2:38: And I think they give that whole movement together a good, a good perspective because Ken is a little bit like on the, only do what the kid wants to side.
2:50: Peter Gray is very philosophical, and I think she made it a little bit more approachable for the, the parent.
2:54: So, hopefully that helps.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Bass (00:00.536)
Brea, I want to open up with a question that I think is very interesting, but you often say that self-directed education is really about adults unlearning control. Where do you see that control instinct coming from? And can you explain that a little bit?

Bria Bloom (00:16.23)
Yeah, and I think it comes from a lot of places. And I think it's more recent if we think about the thousands and thousands of years of human history. I think it's more recent since Industrial Revolution, since schooling has become more prominent or even invented, because that's very recent in our history. But I do think that school really teaches us.

that we need to compete with other people, that we need to be successful in this very specific way in order to get ahead. And I think also, personally, I capitalism in a lot of ways teaches us that as well. We are in competition against each other in order to really survive and get resources. So I think a lot of that creates this kind of fear.

in parents because we really, really care about our kids. We really, really care. Do need to pause? Sorry. okay. We really, really care about their success, their wellbeing. We care about our family's success and wellbeing. So I think the fear of will my kid be okay? Will they be able to get a job? Will they be able to compete in this culture?

Ela Bass (01:19.67)
No, keep going.

Bria Bloom (01:37.473)
at least in Western culture, in the United States and other Western societies, and this culture that is in competition, it's like resources feel scarce, even though maybe in reality they aren't if we distributed them differently. And I think that fear breeds control, because we're trying to control what we can and exert our authority to make sure our kids are successful. And so I think it comes from this really actually caring, loving place.

But for me, in my opinion, it's very misplaced because the control actually inhibits their ability to learn and develop as humans and really know themselves and be able to go out in the world and advocate for themselves and know how to navigate relationships and know their own self-worth and develop their self-esteem. So I think it's misplaced, but I understand where it comes from.

Ela Bass (02:31.104)
Yeah, this is very fascinating. we were talking before that you are good friends with Peter Gray and also Ken Robinson and Ken Danford. And both of them both of them had really amazing things to talk about on this topic. So if anyone's listening, definitely go listen to those episodes after this. But I would love to hear your definition for self-directed education and also your belief for what education's goals should be. Right. You mentioned that.

that schooling is a recent invention and I think it's hard to wrap our heads around that. There's this famous quote, I forget the exact way it goes, but it's something like, we change and then we forget that we changed, and we changed the way that we schooled, and then we forgot that we changed the way that we schooled, and we believed that it was always that way. We always went from K through eight, and then nine through 12, and then college, and like,

Bria Bloom (03:14.24)
Mm.

Ela Bass (03:26.028)
All of these things are just a given. I mean, even the words that we ascribe to them, Like pre-K, you know, and kindergarten through eighth grade, those concepts, right? Eighth grade. Those are new concepts. And like even just wrapping our head around that is wild.

Bria Bloom (03:44.372)
Yeah, it's so interesting you say that. This isn't a side, but my oldest, who's 15, has been unschooled for a long time, has been in and out of SDE schools as it fits for our family. And I didn't go to school. So a lot of times, people in the world would ask him, what grade are you in? Not what age. They're not asking his age, which is the same question for the most part. They ask what grade, and he'd look at me because he had no idea. And I was like, I don't know either. I don't know what age aligns with what.

grade. But that's what we think of when we think of kids to ask them what grade they're in, even though, like we could just as easily ask what age and this is very recent in human history. So that's an aside, but it's very pervasive.

Ela Bass (04:28.268)
Like in the past, it used to be like, how old are you versus like, what is your grade?

Bria Bloom (04:33.79)
I mean, I don't know I wasn't there, but I hope that's what we asked people. Or maybe they didn't even ask age. I wonder how much age matters more now in industrial society because we've ascribed certain things to age. And because we basically allow young humans to do less and less, and they're capable of so much more. So I don't know how much we asked about age a long time ago.

I wonder if it was less. I'm very curious about that, but again, I wasn't there. So it's just a hypothesis.

Ela Bass (05:09.047)
No, I love that.

Bria Bloom (05:09.214)
All right, do you want me to jump right in or do you want to say anything else? All right, so self-directed education, I'm actually going to define in the Alliance's Alliance for Self-Directed Education their terms because this term was coined by the Alliance and the founders of that organization predated my involvement by about six months. But Peter Gray was one of the founders, Pat Ferrenga, who continues John Holt, if you've heard of John Holt, his work.

Ela Bass (05:12.887)
Yes, please.

Bria Bloom (05:39.32)
He was a partner with John Hull and continues his work now for homeschooling and unschooling and a few others or many others were founders and they helped define that term. because that term so wrapped up in ASD, that's the shorthand for the Alliance, I'm gonna use their definition. So one thing I wanna start with is that I think a lot of folks...

Think of education, the word education, as synonymous with the word schooling. We think of education and we think of school. There's various dictionary definitions for the word education, but that's kind of what it is in our mind now because of the schooled society we're in and how prevalent that is. So Asdy really purposefully wanted to use the word education and wanted to define it in a different kind of way. So.

Their definition is education that derives from the self-chosen activities and life experiences of the learner. So using that definition is kind of how they got to this definition of, or how they got to the definition of self-directed education. So the definition of self-directed education is education that derives from the self-chosen activities and life experiences of the learner.

whether or not those activities were chosen deliberately for the purpose of education. So I think a lot of people think of, I mean, in schooling, most of what we're doing is deliberate. It's delivered from a teacher for a specific purpose or from a curriculum for a specific purpose. And we really think about the learning objectives and everything we do in school. For

This term of education, a lot of times I just think about it as living life. Education is everything you know to live your life, and learning happens through living your life. So you might say, I'm going to read this book because I want to learn about biology. Or you might say, I'm going to read this book because it sounds really interesting, and the side effect is something you learn from that book. But you didn't choose it to learn about a specific topic. Sometimes you do, and sometimes you don't.

Bria Bloom (07:50.364)
And self-directed education kind of recognizes that everything we do, we're learning something, even if we're not deliberately stepping into it for the purpose of learning a specific topic.

Ela Bass (08:00.492)
That's really fascinating. Can you go into this idea of deliberate, right? You mentioned that, yeah, that we always associate things with learning objectives. I would love to understand that a little bit more and unpack that from your perspective. Like, what is the right way to approach things?

Bria Bloom (08:20.959)
Can you say a little bit more about what you mean about right way?

Ela Bass (08:23.894)
Well, obviously, it depends on the student. It depends on the moment. I think just from a philosophical perspective, you mentioned that learning happens all the time. You don't have to necessarily say this is learning, this is not learning. Learning is life. And education is happening all the time, no matter what. But how, whenever it comes to your children, how are you making sure that there's a distinction between like,

at least as a parent, whenever you look at their education and the way that they're learning in general. I think it's a, there's this tendency to look at everything as productive or unproductive, right? And as a parent, it's really hard to get to this point where you just see more activities as cool and appropriate.

quote productive or even you divorce yourself from that idea of things needing to be productive anyways. But as a parent, like have you had to fight yourself with this idea or with this like notion of productivity and like the things that they're doing deliberately for math versus not deliberately for math, AKA, or like, you know, just the things that they need to succeed as, individual humans, like how do you approach that as a parent?

Bria Bloom (09:44.008)
Yeah, there's so much to unpack here. But it's interesting because I think there can be stages of this. And I started my quote unquote education career in early childhood because at that point it felt like the place I could be where play was supported, the way the teachers want to handle the classroom or management, those are not my favorite words, but I use them here, of the kids.

Ela Bass (09:59.374)
Mm.

Bria Bloom (10:11.003)
was a lot more open because you don't have a state curriculum or state assessments. Of course, you have no state funding either. That's another issue. But I started there because I just felt like it was a more open space. And what we did where I worked was that we would, it was called emergent curriculum, which comes from Reggio Emilia. So if folks haven't heard of that, I suggest you look it up. It's a town in Italy that developed a.

curriculum and ideology based on their present moment. And people have tried to replicate kind of the values of it in different places in the world. So with emergent curriculum, it's like we're giving them basically what interests them. But these kids are all just playing to learn. And instead of saying, which I think even they do in a lot of preschools, like we're going to give them this activity and here's the learning objectives, we would observe them.

and write about what they were doing, and then highlight what they learned through what they already did. So it's basically just observing what's happening and then figuring out what learning happened in that moment instead of planning for learning. And I think that really helped me in this because I mean, already had this. was an unschooler growing up. So I already kind of believed in it because it worked for me. It felt really good for me. But this could make it really

Ela Bass (11:07.606)
Interesting.

Ela Bass (11:16.686)
Bria Bloom (11:31.551)
a parent really visible and it made it really visible for the parents we were with or working with. I think that really helps if you're starting out and you don't know what learning is happening. I think observing your kids and then trying to go back and be like, what were they learning? What were they processing? What were they trying to figure out in this moment is really helpful to kind of make learning visible where it's already happening, but we don't have to.

clear learning objectives. So after all of that, I think my frame for watching kids, even when they are older, really shifted. And another thing, well, this jumps the ages, but there is a difficult moment, I think, when kids really stop playing in that way young kids play. Because adults don't really play in that same way. And that shift happens. It depends on.

Ela Bass (12:22.478)
Mm.

Bria Bloom (12:29.48)
person, but around 11, 12, 13, 14 for most people. And now suddenly, even in self-directed education, even with unschooling families, a lot of people get really worried because they don't know what to do. Now that their kid isn't playing, now suddenly the learning is less visible unless it looks like academics or looks like learning objectives. So there is this shift, I think, with teenagers and sometimes pre-teens that

you have to think again whether they're learning through what they're doing, but now it's not play. So I think it gets a lot more complex.

Ela Bass (13:05.836)
Hmm, that's interesting. So I want to dive into this like emergent curriculum idea. So because I find it absolutely amazing. Do you involve the kid there or is this like you as the teacher, parent, whatever that are like interested in their learning? Are you the one that is looking at them and just trying to pay attention and trying to like ascribe, it seems like they were learning this.

Or are you trying to also pull that out of the kid themselves to be like, wow, like it looks like you are trying to do this. Is that true? And is it a dialogue between you two or like, how would that work in practice?

Bria Bloom (13:45.011)
You know, I think for the youngest kids, they're so, when you ask them questions, it's so impressionable that it's just, every question can be leading. So like we were with two, three, four year olds, right? So if I ask my three year old, do you feel this way because of this? She doesn't always say yes, but often she does. And then I don't actually know if that's true. I want to believe it's true, but I don't think it always is exactly what the feeling was.

Ela Bass (14:06.53)
Yeah.

Bria Bloom (14:13.722)
So I think asking them about their learning can be a little bit leading. We did have discussions about things with groups of kids. We'd ask them what they thought about certain questions. We'd ask them their hypothesis. We'd test out that hypothesis and play later. So there were some more kind of directed activities in that way, but they could always leave. It's like we're inviting you to this directed activity, but you don't have to be there.

And I think that's kind of the key here, too, with self-directed education, is it doesn't mean there's no directed activities. It doesn't mean there's no worksheet. It doesn't mean there's no classes. It's that the kids are invited or the options are made available to them, and they get to choose whether to participate or not. But it doesn't all have to be unstructured. And it doesn't all have to look like non-academic. And I think that is a misconception that people think.

Ela Bass (14:40.686)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (14:48.75)
Mm.

Ela Bass (14:58.63)
Bria Bloom (15:09.836)
if you're giving them a math textbook or a math worksheet, it's no longer self-directed education. It's like, no, if you're denying them a math workbook when they ask for a math workbook, it's no longer self-directed education, because now me as the parent has decided what's worth it and what's valuable for them to engage in, and that's not self-directed. So I think that is a pretty important distinction here that people kind of get tripped up on.

Ela Bass (15:19.566)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (15:30.67)
Mm.

Bria Bloom (15:36.837)
And I'm trying to return to your original question mentally. But yeah, we do involve the kids in different ways and invite them into things. And we ask them what activities they'd like to do or what materials they'd like or what field trips they'd like to go on. I'm thinking specifically of these young kids right now because that's what we're talking about. We ask them those things and we make it happen as we can. But it's not really put on them quite as much as it would be as they get.

Ela Bass (16:06.97)
So I actually love this and I think where you took it is where we need to go back to and then we can keep on diving into the rest.

there's a spectrum, right? There's a spectrum of schooling and there's also a spectrum of unschooling and self-directed education. And some of it looks like what you mentioned where it's like, okay, you're like literally gonna build everything yourself. Like I'm not gonna do anything, I'm not gonna be involved, I'm not gonna even like ask you what you wanna do, I'm just gonna trust that like you're going to learn. Whereas it sounds like your perspective is more so I'm not going to make them do anything, I'm not going to place...

fear or anxiety on them that if they don't do this then. But I am going to have options and I am going to invite them into things. Can you explain what that looks like? So especially as they get older, this your approach of quote unquote self directed education and unschooling.

Bria Bloom (17:02.206)
Yeah, and I'm like my main, I don't know how to say, the main thing I focus on in this work and even in my life is like the relationship. So this actually will be different depending on what kind of kid you have, what your relationship with them is like. Yeah, and this is my main focus and this is why, I'll save that topic for later actually.

Ela Bass (17:15.224)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (17:21.953)
I love this.

Bria Bloom (17:30.482)
But relationship is something I'm really interested in and something I help support parents and educators through when they want to shift what that relationship looks like. I think that is actually the heart of all of this. And my son and daughter are very different ages, 15-year-old stepson, 3 and 1 1 And they're very different dispositions. So what I've done with my son is probably not what I'll do with my daughter. And it's actually true of my brother and I as well.

Ela Bass (17:42.422)
Yes.

Bria Bloom (17:59.966)
We were very different dispositions and what worked for him, because he's older, started to not work for me and my parents had to shift that. Even though we're in the same situation, really strong parent-kid relationship, we grew up like we didn't move or anything so we had the same access to community and the same place we were living in, really, really different approaches with each of us. So some kids I think you have to

Ela Bass (18:09.92)
Mm.

Bria Bloom (18:29.281)
offer and even nudge and push a little bit more. And there's a caveat on that. I want to come back to it. But nudge them into trying things a little bit more, depending on their disposition, how well you know them, what they've already tried, and things like that. Other kids, this was me, are just going to be like, can I go to this? Can I go to this? Will you find this for me? Can I try out every single possible class I can find?

Ela Bass (18:44.386)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (18:55.33)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (18:57.179)
And you might have to find certain things for them that maybe they didn't know they were interested in. Like my dad found karate for me. had no idea he was looking for that. And he was like, hey, do you want to try this? So he still found things based on knowing me and then offered them to me. But yeah, every kid is going to be different. And then some kids want to do a bunch of different things. And some kids want a more stable environment that's more exactly the same. Not exactly the same, but you know what you're going into.

Ela Bass (19:07.768)
That's awesome.

Bria Bloom (19:26.973)
you know, who the people are. And for those kids, finding some sort of community that you can attend regularly is really important. So it varies wildly based on the child and your relationship with them. So it's really hard to give some sort of blanket answer. And also, the caveat I said earlier about nudging and pushing kids. So if you have a kid who's gone to

Ela Bass (19:46.455)
Yes.

Bria Bloom (19:57.192)
public conventional school. They're used to having their time controlled. They're used to adults telling them what to do. Maybe they're even used to you as the parent telling them what to do, and you're in that situation. And you suddenly want to change and do self-directed education or just something else, even homeschooling. Your relationship is one of them being used to you controlling them. So any nudging and pushing you do at that moment comes with all that baggage.

So a lot of times in that beginning shift, I recommend to parents that they don't nudge and push for a while, that you heal that relationship, that you shift into building more trust and partnership with your young person. And then once you feel that that trust is there and that they know that when you are nudging them, first of all, it's not gonna happen often. And second of all, it's actually for...

coming from a place of knowing them and wanting to support them rather than a place of your own fears or your own assumptions. Once you get to that place, then you can nudge them and push them a little bit more. But if you're not in that place, I don't recommend you really do it that often or ever unless it's like this big like life threatening or safety thing, because you need to repair that relationship and rebuild the trust. So depending where you are on that spectrum with your

Ela Bass (20:57.838)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (21:24.253)
Yeah, can nudge more if you've been an unskiller for a long time and you have respected their no for a really long time. And you can probably nudge less if you haven't respected their no and their personhood for a long time if you want to be able to repair this relationship and shift it towards a more partnership-based collaborative relationship.

Ela Bass (21:50.062)
So it seems like self-directed education in your mind is this partnership experience between child and parent where parent has a certain set of values and a certain set of things that they believe are good for life and they are going to as much as possible help and nudge the kid and the other human to develop those like either ideals, ideas, like habits, skills, whatever, but also completely

respect if their kid does not want that. And like, it's this, it's this mix between like, almost parent slash teacher opens door, kid decides if they're walking through it. And like, that's kind of the self-directed education approach. But I think you hit like something incredible. And I actually have not heard many people talk about it. I've heard people say this loosely, but I haven't heard anybody speak about it as articulately as you. So I'd like to go into it a little bit, but the relationship aspect, right? And

I think the approach of many traditional homeschoolers is, hey, something's not working, I just need to find a new curriculum, right? Not, hey, something's not working, is this a learning option or a problem? Or is this like an us problem? Like is it something to do with the trust that we have? Is it something to do with the relationship that we have? How do you figure out what's going on, especially if you have multiple kids? It's very time consuming to try and work with one kid specifically and then like,

It's a balancing act, right? Let's say that you're a homeschooler or you're at home, you have four kids, you're trying to help all of the other kids, and then there's this one kid that you know really needs help. How do you recommend that parents do that? And where do you recommend that they start whenever they know that something's off, but they don't necessarily know what it is? And then, I mean, I imagine that it gets very complex because as an example, kids can lose trust in you if you give them things that they're not ready for yet.

or like if you push on them some things that they're, let's say that you push on them a really, really difficult curriculum, and then they just are like, hey, I'm like done. Like I'm not ready for this. So it's a very complex interwoven thing about like, how do you actually solve these challenges with a relationship, right?

Bria Bloom (24:08.271)
Yeah, and I do want to go back to one thing you said when you were kind of distilling what I was talking about in self-directed education. I think we do have to be careful how many of our values and ideas about life we try to impose on our kids. They will learn values through living with you, through what you care about. And if you're trying so hard to instill certain values, like this is still a person who's going to grow up

Ela Bass (24:36.59)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (24:38.832)
They have their own personhood. They have their own ideas. So I'm never trying to mold them into what I think is right in the world. I'm trying to model what I think is right in the world. I'm trying to have these discussions and share my ideas. I'm trying to hear their ideas. But I don't want to think about all my values and then try and mold them based on that. And I'm not sure you were saying that, but I feel like some folks could have that idea based on what we were talking about. And I just wanted to clarify that a little bit.

Ela Bass (24:46.53)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (25:08.438)
No, I appreciate that. Yeah. Thanks for the clarification.

Bria Bloom (25:11.312)
Yeah, thank you. I think there's so many it depends when you're talking about relationships. So this is a really, really nuanced, difficult place to be. But I think that when kids, when humans, but kids are the ones who were telling them what to do, basically, and putting them in situations that they didn't choose, when it's not working for them, they show it to us.

Most of them. Some kids internalize a lot of things. They'll keep trying to people please, but that might come out in other ways like anxiety or fawning tendencies. Like it still kind of comes out even for the people pleasing children. But I think they show us. They show us through their mental health. They show us through even like they might rebel more. Not exactly the word I want to use. They might push back more.

at home if they feel too controlled at school or in a certain situation. Behaviors come out when people aren't feeling good about their situation they're in. So I think just paying close attention to that will give you hints as to what's going on. And I will give an example. Again, we did this since birth, so I'm very practiced in noticing what's going on for my kids. even my one, I think she was like one and a half.

Ela Bass (26:12.835)
Mm.

Bria Bloom (26:38.65)
maybe almost two, we put her in this part-time daycare, because I needed to work, she needed more socialization, and I never thought I'd put my little kid in daycare, but here we are, and it was needed for everybody. And the daycare really worked for a long time. And about six months in, she started crying at drop-off every day. She started sobbing through nap time. And at first, I was like, maybe this is just a phase, let's give it a couple weeks, but it kept getting worse.

And she is not even two. She can't say, hey, I don't want to be here anymore. Here's all the things that aren't working for me. She can't list those out at two. She spoke very well at two, but she doesn't have the processing capacity to connect those dots. But I can. I can see how her behavior is changing, how now it's not a phase because it's been going on too long, and that this isn't working for her. So we decided to take her out and shift to a different preschool.

things changed a lot. Her behavior changed, she was really excited to go, she was never crying when she went. And I wanna be careful because sometimes drop off is hard for kids regardless. So it's not like your kid's never gonna cry when you drop them off at preschool. Work with your teacher, they have a lot of knowledge about this if your kid is going to preschool or daycare. But it was very clear something huge changed in her behavior.

And that was a very clear signal to me. So I think even our littlest ones are giving us signals. We just have to look for them. And if your kid's older, you can then ask them, like, what's going on for you? What's stressful about your day? How's school feel if they're in school? How's this curriculum feel if they're doing the curriculum? But you also have to really care about the answer and show them that, like, based on their answer, you will change something.

Because if you're just asking and then there's no behavior or change behind it, they might not really even want to share the truth with you. Like, if there is like a history of you just asking them things and then not changing anything based on their feedback, why would they want to get into that conversation? But if you're just starting out at this, you could say, like, I really want to change because I'm seeing this is tough for you. So can you help me figure out what's tough for you so we can decide together what to do instead so that it feels good forever?

Ela Bass (28:29.582)
Mm.

Bria Bloom (28:59.952)
And then make a change, because you want to back your words with actual action, or else they're not going to trust you next time you say that. So yeah, looking for the signals and signs that show that they're feeling distressed, that's not working for them, and then being honest with them about it, and then making a plan with them. Like, I want to involve you in this shift. What would work for you? Let's figure it out. And I think the other key piece of this is that we're going to mess up.

Like, my kid was there for maybe a month crying at drop off and nap time. Like, all in all, I think it was maybe a month. And she'll be OK. Like, it's OK to mess up. It's OK to be in difficult situations and not change right away. It's OK to shift to a situation that also doesn't work and try things out. If you have that flexibility in your life, I'm speaking about people who have more flexibility to make these changes and try things out.

Like, it's OK to mess up. It's OK to not notice right away. It's OK to shift to something that doesn't work. It's OK to make mistakes in relationships. It's OK to harm a relationship. Like, people yell at their kids. They get in fights. Kids yell at parents and then go back and repair. Like, the repair and the apology is so important. And sharing the honesty of like, I don't have the perfect answer.

I don't know what perfect school or center or friend is going to fix this for you, because I am a human trying to figure it out, and I need your help in figuring it out, and I'm going to make mistakes. So being human and real about that and forgiving yourself for being human and real, I think is really important. We're not trying to be perfect the first time, and we're not trying to not make mistakes. We're just living a life with each other, and it's really hard. It's really complicated.

Ela Bass (30:54.796)
That's amazing. think that was like nailed it on the head. And I think all of your, yeah, all of your amazing words to parents that are trying to figure it out, like there's this fear. I mean, there's fear that makes you control on and there's fear whenever you let go of control that you're going to mess up and that it's not going to work. like you're.

you are so focused on the minute moment that like, it's really hard to recognize, okay guys, like it's just a month. Like we're going to see if this persists or see if this works. And like sometimes time is the thing that's gonna change it. Like you can't speed up, you know, having somebody get something you can't speed up, finding the right moment or finding the right opportunity. As a parent that is interested in self-dra...

directed education, like I want to look at kind of how you did it from young years to older years. What does it look like from the youngest years? Because we touched on the fact that like there are some kids that are going to go from public school, very structured education to a much more unstructured education. for the kids that are going to go just from unstructured throughout, what is your approach in that?

Bria Bloom (32:17.409)
Yeah, and go ahead.

Ela Bass (32:19.84)
And I'll also preface with the fact that it is possible that I'm saying a couple words that like unstructured may not be exactly the right approach. if that, yeah, if there are any like language things that you just want to dial in on to make sure that you do.

Bria Bloom (32:36.133)
Totally fine. Thank you.

Now my brain has gone somewhere else. I keep having the start, and then the start leaves my mind. All right. I want to say first that actually myself and a couple of colleagues did a whole podcast on self-directed education from the early years. So if you have resources to share with people, I will send that to you, because it is very different in the early years before your kids can speak to you, before you're even in school.

Ela Bass (32:55.98)
Love. Yes.

Ela Bass (33:06.359)
Yeah.

Bria Bloom (33:08.431)
So I think the beauty of starting from the beginning is that most of us, I would say a huge majority of us, actually do unschooling and self-directed education values from the start. Because that's just raising our small children and them playing. And it seems that until kids are age five and school says, hey, send your kids to school, we're totally fine. We're just raising our kids and playing. So it's interesting that the switch happens right when school tells us.

which is again, I think why school, the ideas of school and it being important are just reinforced by school itself. I don't think that's inherent that we think age five, there's some sudden shift. I think it's because school has shown that to us for many, many years. And we think that there must be a research and merit in that because it's what everyone does. So I think people are already doing it in a lot of ways when their kids are really young.

Ela Bass (33:38.37)
Hmm.

Bria Bloom (34:05.028)
I will say where it gets complicated is if you have to work. I mean, that's where all of this gets complicated. If you both have to work, if your kid is a more maybe introverted kid who wants or more of a homebody and they want to stay home all the time and you don't have that option, it can be a little difficult. But I want to speak to the people who do have those options because I will say that when we had our youngest, I thought she would never.

Ela Bass (34:10.488)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (34:32.731)
go to daycare or preschool. Because I was like, you hold on to your little ones, you stay with your little ones, you raise your little ones, that's really important. And why would you send them to childcare? Well, because they want to go. Or because in order to be a really present, happy, engaged parent, 95 % of the time, they need to have childcare or the other. mean, 80 % of the time, they need to have childcare, 20 % of the time.

which is the situation I found myself in, like being with her all the time, a little bit isolated, didn't feel good anymore, so let's get her into this place for some of the time so I can be more refreshed, to be more present. So there's all these little decisions when they're little that again, they can't really verbally communicate with you about, and you just have to assess what works for them and what do I need to be.

a more present, engaged human and to be like happy with myself because we are people in this too. I never want to tell parents like forget all of your own needs and just fulfill your kids needs. I think that's another trap that people fall into. They go too far one way and they forget that they're a person too and we need to take care of ourselves. So there's all these little decisions to make. And for my youngest, like she really wanted to be with kids.

Ela Bass (35:30.956)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (35:56.188)
most of the time once she turned two. So now...

Ela Bass (35:59.287)
How did you know? Just like micro moments where like you'd go out playground, she's just like, I wanna stay. Okay.

Bria Bloom (36:05.529)
Yeah, yeah, she's always wanting, like at the playground, she always wants to find kids to play with. When she did, because she was in like part-time preschool for a while, when she did go, she was so excited to go every day, didn't want to leave, things like that. And that was hard for me because I want to be home with her more. So finding the balance has been difficult, but now she's in like sort of full-time, like six hours a day, five days a week. And that works.

Also, it's paid for by our city. So we have a very privileged position there that we wouldn't otherwise be able to access. But that has worked. I think when my oldest was three, he would have been like, mm-mm, I want to stay home. So if we had access to that, we would have kept him home. Like my brother, when he was little, didn't like preschool. So it really depends on your kid and what you can access and what works for your family and schedule. So just constantly.

Ela Bass (36:47.99)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (37:03.995)
testing those things out and paying attention to your kid and yourself and your family and how it works is important in the early years. But otherwise, we let kids play. We let them learn to talk and walk through just talking and walking with us. All those things are self-directed education and action. So I think we're actually prepared to keep doing this if we can just undo that conditioning that at age five somehow they're not able to learn.

Ela Bass (37:32.012)
Yeah, and then, okay, so let's go a little further. So I think that there's this kind of, there's the checkbox mentality of like, okay, well, my kid needs to know every subject that is just like baseline. And usually like, that is fear that they won't get into college and their future options are limited. But I chatted with Peter about that a little bit and his thoughts were awesome.

but then there's also like this other emphasis on like my kid needs to be involved in every single possible, enrichment opportunity. And, and I think at least there there's some sort of like a, at least they need to try it situation. so when, when kids get older, when they can articulate things to you, how have you handled and how does, yeah, how have you handled at least the, the

here's how much structure I want to help make available for the kid that needs it and the kid that wants it. And here's the structure that I actually don't want to make available. Because I think the biggest misconception that I've seen over time in unschooling is a parent thinks that a kid can do everything on their own. They don't need to open any doors. And I think that's really dangerous depending on the kid. I've chatted with a couple of families and like,

who have a friend or something like that that has a kid with dyslexia or like a kid with a learning disability and like that's very, very difficult for them to get the help that they need if the doors aren't open for it. So how do you see that experience of like, okay, we're gonna open the right doors and then we're just gonna see where they walk through and also that relationship piece of, hey, you should do this if that's there.

Bria Bloom (39:20.642)
Yeah, and I might sound like a broken record eventually because I'm going to keep saying, like, it's your relationship and you noticing what's going on for the kid. So if you have that close relationship and you're noticing, you're probably going to notice if there's something like dyslexia going on or something else that they need more support with. And I think, of course, we miss things, and that's OK. We'll figure them out later. The kid will figure them out later. It's not like it's OK to make mistakes and miss things we don't

Ela Bass (39:34.904)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (39:46.285)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (39:50.479)
to be like hawks staring at them all the time, trying to assess every part of how they learn in their humanity. So I'm not trying to say that. But I think you will notice those places where they need extra help. I mean, the other part's really hard because it does vary wildly depending on the family and their values and the kids.

Ela Bass (39:52.077)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (40:19.65)
Some families are going to have this super strong bottom line that my kid has to do one art class, or they have to learn math. Or some families, it's actually really important to their, I don't want to say survival, but cultural survival that their kids learn to read. I think it's really different in families with people of color because their families end.

their capabilities as parents are looked at differently and judged more harshly. So it's more important for them to teach reading, I've heard from these families, at an early age than it is for a lot of white families because of the safety issue of people and how they perceive kids of color who can't read at a certain age. So there's things like that that are really specific to culture and safety and family life. But it's not the same.

Ela Bass (41:11.426)
That's interesting.

Bria Bloom (41:16.92)
It's not the same for my family. And I know that. And I know I have that privilege to let my kid not read until they're older. But I think any blanket rule, and I think this is where unschooling, self-directed education can get a little dogmatic. Any blanket rule, like don't teach them to read, let it happen naturally isn't fair. And we really have to look at the nuance of the culture and the family and the learning disabilities and things like that.

Ela Bass (41:34.648)
for sure.

Bria Bloom (41:48.216)
I'm trying to think, can you clarify your first original question about kind of structure and how you pick it and how you don't?

Ela Bass (41:56.384)
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm really curious because I think like I've been mostly exposed to on the unschool side like the the kid that chooses everything for themselves, right and and I hesitate to to say necessarily that that like a parent needs to impose structure but I think like it is it is real that sometimes parents have values or like in the example that that you Labeled like sometimes it's a matter of safety. Like it's a matter of

It's a matter of like our family just needs to know this. Like this will make me feel very comfortable if our family just knows this. And I think like the standards that maybe school sets are not always the ones that you need to hold yourself stringently to, but how do you as a parent decide the standards that you want to set as minimum?

Because I think that that's an important conversation to have with yourself, with your spouse, with your kids too. Just like, what is our minimum?

Bria Bloom (43:01.57)
Yeah, definitely. And I like that you added the kids in there too, because maybe the kids have minimums that are so different from yours. Maybe the kids notice that you're picking up your phone all throughout dinner, and you don't notice that. That happens if adults have phones and kids don't. Some teenagers these days are way better at their phone use boundaries than I am, to be honest. So to have that reciprocal relationship where everyone can

call each other in and discuss issues. And I just jump to the phone because it's like an easy one that I think a lot of us have difficulty with. But if you're leaving the family conversation, not that phones are always bad. I definitely believe in tech and how great these tools can be. But if you're leaving a conversation and ignoring someone, that's an issue to point out. So there's minimum family relational standards and agreements that I think everyone.

Ela Bass (43:35.106)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (43:44.173)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (43:54.893)
Yeah.

Bria Bloom (43:58.476)
once they're old enough to verbalize should be a part of making. And that's just part of being in community together. A family is in community and their household the same way. People are in community in schools or SDE centers. So if you're talking about chores, talking about like minimum viable, how clean you want your house, how many dishes you want available, and then who's gonna pitch in what because we are all part of this.

And once you're old enough to do dishes or whatever it is, you are a part of making this family.

system work and supporting everyone in it. So I think those are conversations to have. What I would recommend against is the adults deciding what the minimum standards are by themselves and then telling the kids what to do. And of course, you can say, I want everyone to pitch in. I want everyone to have a chore or a job or whatever. And the kids need to be involved in that.

And I don't think that's the same kind of imposing that maybe some people think it is because you're just, again, in a community taking care of your space together. So it's all about framing there and it's about the family deciding together. But there are gonna be different things people are comfortable with. Like I said, the reading piece is different depending on your cultural values or your cultural safety or how people perceive you. I think there's other pieces.

that some people deem super, super important, and I wouldn't. Like, you really need to learn, I don't know, I'll say math. I don't know why it's always math. I think people learn enough math on their own through living life. But let's say someone doesn't believe that, and they're really worried about their kid not learning math.

Bria Bloom (45:46.553)
The less bottom line, this is super important to me, you have to do this in our family, things you have, the easier it's gonna be to have that reciprocal, trustful relationship. But when you have that relationship and you say, hey, this is really important to me, here's why, how do you feel about trying it out, maybe we can do it together, then the kid's more likely to say yes. When there's less things that we're requiring of them or imposing on them.

and you can lay out why the value's important to you, then they're more likely to be like, sure, I'll try it. If that's important to you, let's do it, let's figure it out. Or even if you're like, no, you have to do this, they're more likely to be okay with that if you have less of those standards. So my recommendation is really, really think about what your bottom lines are, what your values are, and take the ones that only feel the most, most important to you. And as much as you can involve like,

whole family in that and do it together and then make guidelines and things you want to engage in together. Because also I think a lot of things aren't fair to say, the kid has to do this, but the parent can't. Like the kid has to put away their devices at dinner, but the parent can have devices at dinner. Or what if the parent forgot all their math? The kid has to learn this math, the parent doesn't even know anymore, but the parent doesn't have to learn the math. Like that's a really interesting space to be in.

Ela Bass (47:09.932)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (47:13.143)
because now you're recognizing that you forgot everything that you learned. So why is it important to you? So I think the more you can dig into those things, the more you'll realize why something's important, what's not important, and what can be like more of a family value rather than just your parent value.

Ela Bass (47:16.182)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (47:31.15)
I like that distinction a lot. I'm curious for you and in your own life, you mentioned that you send your daughter to five days a week school, quote unquote self-directed probably school, but how do you stay connected to her learning whenever she's in a different environment all the time? So you mentioned that that relationship piece is really important and like.

paying attention is very important, but how do you personally stay connected to that when most of that learning is happening, you know, not with you there?

Bria Bloom (48:05.112)
Yeah, isn't that interesting? And I know Peter says all the time that it's really important for kids to play away from their parents, or to be away from their parents. And I think that's true. I think that's really true. And I think you also have to trust that your kid is learning, they're playing, they're engaging. You're going to get some reports from the teachers. If you want more, you can ask them for those. But I just trust that as long as she comes home and

she has been playing and being with her friends all day, and she's happy about that, that she's getting what she needs. And again, she's three. It feels a lot different than your teenager coming home. And then you're asking them, what did you learn? What are you interested in? And maybe you're not getting all the information. It's a different level of trust there and a different level of assessment. But yeah, for Nova, like she is

playing with her friends, she's engaging, and I trust that means she's learning all the things because that's how three-year-olds learn all the things. I chose the preschool really, really specifically knowing that it was a place that's very respectful of kids, that really honors their autonomy, trusts that kids are really capable, and that their day is play. That's what they do. So Nova plays a game that she calls school at home.

And all she does, it's like her stuffed animals go to school and all she does is they play games, they go outside, they eat food and they rest. I was like, if that's what school is for everybody, I am so pro school, like let's make it happen. And I love that that's what school means to her. And I hope that continues throughout her life. We'll see what happens and what she chooses to do, but I just love that that's what school is.

Ela Bass (49:56.896)
I love that. And I want to spend a little bit just in our last little bit of time together focusing in on your self-directed upbringing. Because I think that's another part of this that is really cool is that this isn't just you having this philosophical belief and now trying it out on your kids. You've actually gone through it. And I think that gives you a different kind of perspective on it.

What advantages would you say that you have and have had throughout your life because of your self-directed upbringing? How do you see it having changed your own life?

Bria Bloom (50:32.94)
I mean, for me, it's everything, I would say. But that's specific to me. I'm sure my brother's answer would be a little different, because now I obviously work in self-taught education, unschooling. I went all in. It was really like I really, really wanted kids most of my life. And I really wanted to raise them in the way I was raised. So it's really important in my family life as well. So I think I'm a very specific case, and I don't want to say it's true for all.

Ela Bass (50:36.405)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (50:43.501)
Mm-hmm.

Bria Bloom (51:02.84)
unschoolers growing up. But if we're taking that out of it, a lot of the key like traits I think I have came from just being an unschooler as a kid. So I feel like my life, there's a lot of flexibility and changing decisions and seeking jobs outside of.

the norm and building a life structure that works for me. And again, there's privilege in being able to do that. And it depends on what your money situation is, what your family situation is. And I want to recognize that. But just being able to view my life and think, I don't have to work a nine to five. I don't have to get this specific job from an employer. There's so many ways I can patch things together so it works for my time. Like when my baby was born, I don't have to keep going to work.

We can make way less money and change our lifestyle to fit that. And I can stay home with my baby. Like all these doors feel very open to me and the flexibility is there. And I think it's just how I view life. And also just asking for things, like just reaching out to someone and saying, can I be involved in that? Do you need an assistant here? Can I learn from your, I don't know.

Can I learn from you here? Can I come observe? Like those kinds of things are, it's something my dad really encouraged me to do when I was younger and it just carried on throughout my life. And some of these things I don't realize that other people don't do because it was so ingrained in my life. Like even getting involved in ASD, it's cause I met Peter at a conference and I pitched an idea to him and he was like, yeah, I get in touch. And then I emailed and I was like, can I work with you? Here's my idea.

And I think schooled kids can do that too, but that kind of thing, like go find options, go look for different things and go ask people if you can get involved was really, really nurtured. And if someone says no, that's just an opportunity that's not for you right now. Like no is okay. Like no or failure didn't feel detrimental to me because we're just.

Ela Bass (53:03.276)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (53:10.094)
Hmm.

Bria Bloom (53:22.37)
testing things out, we're just putting ourselves out there, we're just seeing what happens and there's always another option that you can look into.

Ela Bass (53:30.208)
I love that. And this has been something that I've definitely realized recently, which is like this idea of happiness in later life. think what is really dangerous about this mentality of, you know, check the box, do what you're told, is that you never gauge your own happiness in the process and you don't hold it as important because the most important thing is what you're supposed to do. The most important thing is, you know, checking that box. The most important thing is all of these

all of these other people's values, they're so important to you that you are willing to put them ahead of your own happiness. And I've definitely seen that become more prevalent where it's just like, you know, somebody's willing to stay in a situation that they absolutely hate because that's what they're told to do. And that's what, you know, the pressure is on them to do.

Bria Bloom (54:21.451)
Yeah, I think that's a great point. And when I think about what I actually want for my kids and what I think they're learning through not being in school and through being in this strong, supportive relationship is being able to define for themselves what a good life is. Because I think school and work and capitalism a lot of times define a good life for us, and then we just buy into it.

Ela Bass (54:36.685)
Mm.

Bria Bloom (54:49.78)
You don't want to have kids or get married. Don't have kids or get married. But it's really hard to figure out, or a number of any other decisions that we make, right? But it's really hard to figure that out when, as you said, the system is constantly telling you what you should care about and what you should achieve. And if I can raise them in a way where they know themselves, where they feel OK about failure and trying things out, and where they can define for themselves what a good life is, no.

matter what that is for them. They get to define it and choose it and seek it out, then I feel like that's success. So I think that's maybe why I don't get so worried about these things that a lot of people get worried about, because my definition of what I want for my kids is so wildly different. And I know they're more likely to get that in with what we're doing than any other situation they could be in.

Ela Bass (55:45.984)
No, this has been amazing. I have three rapid fire questions for you really quickly to end this off. But I have loved hearing your perspective on this because I don't think I've ever gone as deep into into like the day to day experience. like Ken was a lot about his his school, quote unquote. He'd probably hate that I said that, but his his not school.

And then Peter was more about like just the philosophy behind self-directed learning, self-directed children, self-directed humans. And I think this was really amazing from the perspective of a parent that wants to open this option and an opportunity for their kids to be self-directed learners. Like what does that actually look like in practice and how do you do that and where does it start? So rapid fire question number one.

Is there anything that you're worried about? So choice and personalization seem to be, actually, which is awesome, becoming more mainstream. A lot more public education options are opening up and things like that. But is there anything along this line that you are worried about with this movement of education evolving?

Bria Bloom (57:02.199)
I guess it depends on, you mean worried about where self-directed education will take us.

Ela Bass (57:08.706)
Where like, so right now there's a lot of movement in just education, evolving education innovation in the public schools, like everybody's talking about education right now. And I'm curious if there's anything that you see that you're like, hmm, I don't necessarily know if this is the right approach to this. Like, I'm glad that y'all are talking about personalization. I'm glad that y'all are talking about innovating inside of education finally, but.

Is there anything that you're like, I don't know if that's necessarily the right approach to this.

Bria Bloom (57:41.569)
I mean, I think my biggest concern is that if we do innovate conventional public schools, will they all end up being the same cookie cutter, innovated cookie cutter way of doing things, but still the same? And then people are more likely to actually keep choosing them and not question it, even if it's not working still for every kid. Because we can make them more arts integrated, more project based, more lovely for so many kids. And I think that's important. But then,

Ela Bass (57:51.374)
Mm.

Ela Bass (57:58.466)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (58:06.626)
Mm-hmm

Bria Bloom (58:11.906)
Will people stop questioning and stop thinking about like, wait, does this still work for every kid? Because not every model will work for every kid. And software-directed education is about finding what works for your kid because not one thing works for everyone.

Ela Bass (58:17.186)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (58:26.414)
I love that second question. Do you have advice for a parent that is starting self directed education? Let's say that they've heard about it. They have been either homeschooling or doing some other approach and now they're like, OK, let's try this out.

Bria Bloom (58:44.359)
Yeah, mean, my main advice is to go to ASD's website because we have a ton of different ways to find resources, find connection, find possibilities. You can just email us and be like, I'm just starting, help me. And we will connect you with everything we can connect you with. So I do think that's the best one-stop shop for all those things. But let's say you're not doing that. The other advice would be to find people.

however you want to online, in person, who are going to support you and support your decision and help you stumble through it together.

Ela Bass (59:25.068)
I love that, that's great. And what is the website again so that people can go to it?

Bria Bloom (59:30.251)
Yeah, it's [self-directed.org](http://self-directed.org/).

Ela Bass (59:33.462)
Amazing. And my last question for you, I hope everyone goes and checks that out and also go check out those podcasts with Peter and Ken. But when you look at the future of education, what is your dream for it? Is it that it is more localized and smaller? Like what would, if you were painting out the picture, what would it look like?

Bria Bloom (59:58.712)
I mean, for me, education is living our lives. And I think what we need to live our lives better and more supported right now is community and more people supporting each other, even in raising kids. And of course, there's a lot of ways society has created our cities so that we don't have access to that. So a lot of things would have to change. But let's just say we keep everything else as it is, and we just take the schools and turn them into

opt-in community centers where there's access to adults, a lot like liberated learners, but for all ages, there's places for young kids to be watched, for people to play. Maybe there's teenagers watching the younger kids. Like it's integrated. All ages, like even senior centers are in there. So I think that's the easiest for me to imagine as we take the schools and we make them all ages, community centers, and even childcare centers for people to learn and mingle and be with each other.

Ela Bass (01:00:58.934)
That's amazing. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast for sharing all of these things. And yeah, I hope that people go and check out the website. I hope people go and listen to those other podcasts. And if they want to find you more, where can they find anything about you?

Bria Bloom (01:01:15.095)
Um, everything that I do is linked from my website, [briabloom.com](http://briabloom.com/). I also have a sub stack, it's partnership parenting and yeah, everything else is on my website. I have a bunch of articles there. do a lot of writing podcast episodes. My information about flying squads is on there. That's another model that a colleague and I co-founded. So you can find all of that on there.

Ela Bass (01:01:40.408)
Thank you so much for coming on the podcast.

Bria Bloom (01:01:41.89)
Thank you.
