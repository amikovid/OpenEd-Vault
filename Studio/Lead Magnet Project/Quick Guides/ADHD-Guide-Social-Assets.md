## ADHD Reels

### Reel 1: Minecraft vs Homework
**Text:**
```
6 hours of Minecraft. No problem.
6 minutes of homework. Impossible.
It's not laziness. It's their brain.
```

### Reel 2: The 30% Rule
**Text:**
```
Your 12-year-old with ADHD has the planning skills of an 8-year-old.
That's neurology, not attitude.
```

### Reel 3: Auditory Exclusion
**Text:**
```
They're not ignoring you.
When you yell, their brain literally can't process words.
```

### Reel 4: Wall of Awful
**Text:**
```
The Wall of Awful:
Every past failure builds a wall they have to climb before they can even start.
```

### Reel 5: Interest-Based Brain
**Text:**
```
ADHD brains don't run on "this is important."
They run on: Interest. Urgency. Novelty. Challenge.
```
