# 5 Things You Can Do This Week If Your ADHD Kid Is Struggling in School

*A quick guide for parents who are tired of fighting the system*

## First, Read This

Your child isn't broken. Their brain works differently - and the traditional classroom wasn't designed for how they learn.

Kids with ADHD have an **interest-based nervous system**, not an importance-based one. When a teacher says "this is important for your grade," neurotypical brains engage. ADHD brains literally cannot access motivation through importance alone.

That's why your kid can hyperfocus for six hours on Minecraft but can't focus six minutes on homework. It's not laziness. It's neurology.

Here are five things you can start doing this week - whether you're considering homeschool or just trying to survive the current situation.

## 1. Expect the Executive Function Age, Not the Birthday Age

**The 30% Rule:** Kids with ADHD are roughly 30% behind their peers in executive function (planning, organizing, self-monitoring).

| Their age | Their executive function |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| 9 | ~6 years old |
| 12 | ~8 years old |
| 15 | ~10 years old |
| 18 | ~12 years old |

**This week:** Stop expecting your 12-year-old to manage their day like a 12-year-old. Would you expect an 8-year-old to remember their own permission slips? Adjust your expectations - not for learning, but for managing the learning.

## 2. Work With Their Brain, Not Against It

ADHD brains need one of four things to engage:

- **Interest** - They find it genuinely fascinating
- **Urgency** - The deadline is NOW
- **Novelty** - It's new and different
- **Challenge** - It's difficult enough to be stimulating

**This week:** Pick one homework battle. Instead of fighting it, ask: Can I make this interesting? Add urgency? Try a new approach? Make it harder (yes, harder)?

Example: Math problems about Pokémon. Spelling words written in shaving cream. Reading while walking on a balance beam.

## 3. Understand the Wall of Awful

Every time your child tries something and fails, that failure gets added to an emotional wall they have to climb over before starting the task again.

This is why your bright, capable kid can sit at the table for two hours without starting their work. They're not defiant. They're staring at a 40-foot wall built from every past criticism, failure, and time they disappointed someone.

**This week:** When they're stuck, don't lecture (that makes the wall higher). Try:
- Sit with them while they start (body doubling)
- Break it into the smallest possible first step
- Acknowledge the wall exists: "This seems hard. I get it."

## 4. Regulate Yourself First

When you raise your voice, your child's brain goes into fight-or-flight. A phenomenon called **auditory exclusion** kicks in - they literally cannot process your words. Their ears only hear low-frequency sounds (like danger). Not your voice.

They're not ignoring you. They're neurologically unable to hear you.

**This week:** Before you engage with a struggling child, check yourself:
- Lower your voice
- Soften your face
- Relax your shoulders

Then get curious instead of furious: "I notice this seems hard. What would make it easier?"

## 5. Remember: You Can Change the Curriculum

In traditional school, if the curriculum isn't working, the assumption is the student is the problem.

At home, if the curriculum isn't working, you change the curriculum.

The curriculum is a tool. If your hammer doesn't work, you get a new hammer. You don't sit there hitting your thumb thinking "I must be bad at hammering."

**This week:** Identify one thing that's consistently not working. Give yourself permission to try something completely different. Switch the math program. Try audiobooks instead of reading. Move school outside.

## The Bigger Picture

You're not failing your child. The system is failing to adapt to how their brain works.

The question isn't whether you're qualified to teach them. The question is whether the current environment is qualified to reach them.

Most parents who pull their ADHD kids from traditional school say the same thing: "I wish I'd done it sooner."
