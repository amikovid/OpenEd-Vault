# Social Assets: "You're Qualified" Reel

**Existing reel:** "Sign from the universe that you're qualified to teach your child"

**Lead magnet to pair:** Confidence Scripts (pending - need book chapter)
**CTA keyword:** SCRIPTS or QUALIFIED

---

## Caption (Simple)

```
You taught them to walk.
You taught them to talk.
You taught them to share, apologize, tie their shoes.

The only question is who picks the curriculum - you or a stranger.

Comment QUALIFIED if you needed this today.
```

---

## Alternative Caption (With Lead Magnet CTA)

```
You're already their teacher.

The hardest part isn't the teaching - it's the conversations.

"What about socialization?"
"What will your mother-in-law think?"
"Are you sure you're qualified?"

I put together the exact scripts I use. Word for word.

Comment SCRIPTS and I'll send them.
```

It's whether the current environment is qualified to reach them.
