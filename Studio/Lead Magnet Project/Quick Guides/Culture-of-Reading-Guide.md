# How to Create Readers (Not Screen Addicts)

*A librarian mom's playbook for building a reading culture at home*

## The Hard Truth Nobody Wants to Hear

If screens are competing with books in your house, books will lose.

That's not a moral judgment. It's brain chemistry. Screens deliver dopamine hits that pages can't match. And this isn't just about kids - most adults struggle with this too.

Janssen Bradshaw runs one of the most popular book recommendation accounts on Instagram (600K followers). She was a school librarian. She grew up surrounded by books. And she'll tell you straight: the secret isn't finding the right book. It's shaping the environment.

Books first. Screens second. That's the order that matters.

## What a Reading Home Actually Looks Like

Janssen's house has somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books. (She's a book blogger, so that's extreme.) But the principles work at any scale:

**Physical environment:**
- Books in every room, not just on one shelf
- A dedicated spot for library books (so you never lose them)
- No TV as background noise - it's either on for a purpose or off
- Audio book players accessible to kids (Yoto, Echo Dot with Audible)

**Daily rhythms:**
- Reading aloud every night - even to teenagers
- Family reading time where everyone reads their own book (30 min before lunch in her homeschool)
- Regular library trips as a family habit

**The key insight:** Her kids don't see reading as "educational." They see it as what their family does. It's identity, not assignment.

## When One Kid Reads and Another Struggles

Janssen's oldest daughter tested at a 12th grade reading level in kindergarten. Reading came easy.

Her second daughter? Barely at grade level in first grade - and drifting lower every assessment.

Same parents. Same books everywhere. Same read-alouds. Completely different results.

Here's what she learned:

**It's not about effort or intelligence.** Her struggling daughter was bright. Reading is just genuinely hard for some kids. That difficulty was making her feel stupid and starting to hate school.

**The critical window is real.** By third grade, school shifts from "learning to read" to "reading to learn." Kids who aren't competent readers by then often never catch up - because now every subject assumes you can read the textbook.

**One-on-one help changed everything.** A college intern working with her daughter 15-20 minutes daily produced more progress in weeks than months of classroom instruction.

The daughter who struggled in first grade was reading at an 11th grade level by fifth grade.

## Practical Hacks That Actually Work

### Keep Their Hands Busy

Kids (and adults) struggle to just sit and listen. Janssen's trick: let them do something with their hands during read-alouds.

- Legos
- Coloring
- Play-Doh
- Jigsaw puzzles

This isn't distraction. It's engagement. The hands-busy, ears-open approach works for audio books too.

### Read With Them, Not Just To Them

Janssen's mom would get two copies of a book and alternate pages with her - even through high school. Pride and Prejudice. Tale of Two Cities. Books that would be overwhelming alone became accessible with a guide.

You can:
- Point out things to notice ("Watch this character - she's important later")
- Catch when they're lost and slow down
- Make it feel like shared discovery, not assignment

### Let Them Revisit Favorites

Her kids have listened to some audio book series 15-20 times. This isn't laziness - it's how deep connection forms. Rereading builds the kind of love that lasts.

Those shared references become family language. Inside jokes. Identity.

### Use What They Already Love

If your kid loves a YouTube channel, turn on captions.

If they love movies, find the screenplay.

If they're obsessed with Minecraft, there are Minecraft novels.

The goal isn't to replace their interests with "real" books. It's to connect reading to what already has their attention.

## Signs It's Working

- They ask for "just one more chapter"
- They talk about characters like real people
- They recommend books to siblings or friends
- They choose reading when they're bored (at least sometimes)
- They have opinions about what they like and don't like

---

## Signs You Might Need More Help

Not every kid will become a voracious reader, and that's okay. But watch for:

- Consistent struggle with grade-level material
- Reading avoidance that's getting worse, not better
- Frustration that's affecting their confidence in other areas
- The gap between them and peers is widening

If the "learn to read" window (K-3) is closing and they're still struggling, don't wait. One-on-one tutoring - even 15-20 minutes daily - can make a dramatic difference.

## The Confidence That Comes From Hard Things

When Janssen asked her daughter if she was embarrassed that mom talked publicly about her reading struggles, the daughter said:

"Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

That's the real gift. Not just reading skills - but knowing in your bones that hard things can be conquered. That's confidence no one can take away.
