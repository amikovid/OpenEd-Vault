# X/Twitter - Platform Insights

**Status:** Draft - consolidating from multiple sources

---

## Success Heuristic

**"I wish I said that"** - Content people want to affiliate with. Retweet-worthy means the person is saying "this represents me" or "I wish I had thought of that."

This is fundamentally different from LinkedIn (thought leadership) or Facebook (engagement bait). On X, you're crafting quotable statements people want to claim as their own.

## What Works

### Content Types
- Short, punchy takes (70-100 chars optimal despite 280 limit)
- Threads for longer concepts (each tweet should stand alone)
- Quote tweets adding value to trending content
- Replies that add insight (reply game > posting until 500-1000 followers)

### Formats
- One-liners that crystallize a truth
- Pattern recognition ("I've noticed...")
- Contrarian takes ("Unpopular opinion...")
- Lists with surprising entries
- Before/after framings

### Engagement Strategy (from Notion)
- Reply 20 times while curating content
- Create two lists: Peers + Big accounts
- Comment on trending tweets
- Unfollow/mute those who don't reciprocate
- Threads = collections of standalone tweets

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Threads where tweets don't stand alone
- Too formal/corporate voice
- Hashtag overload (1-2 max)
- External links in main tweet (kills reach)
- Long-winded explanations
- Arrow bullets (→) - AI tell
- "Here's the thing:" throat-clearing

---

## Video on X

- Horizontal preferred (1.27 width ratio)
- Topic keyword in first sentence
- Find a unique type of content you're known for
- Short clips with clear value proposition

---

## API Limitations (Get Late)

- **No X Articles** - Long-form requires posting through X directly
- **No atomic threads** - Must post tweets individually
- **280 char limit** - Standard tweets only

---

## Platform-Specific Voice

- Witty, concise, confident
- Slightly irreverent
- Strong opinions stated simply
- No hedging ("maybe we should consider...")

---

## OpenEd-Specific Notes

- Education hot takes perform well
- Quote-tweet education news with contrarian angle
- Tag people who will RT (builds network)
- Use for distribution after LinkedIn/blog posts
