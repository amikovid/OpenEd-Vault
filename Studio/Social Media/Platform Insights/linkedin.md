# LinkedIn - Platform Insights

**Status:** Draft - consolidating from linkedin-content skill + references

---

## Success Heuristic

**Thought leadership + vulnerability** - LinkedIn rewards long-form content that demonstrates expertise while being personal. The "comment-to-get" strategy (offer value in exchange for comment) drives massive engagement.

---

## What Works

### Content Types
- Long-form posts (200-500 words optimal)
- Personal stories with professional lessons
- Frameworks and mental models
- Contrarian takes on industry norms
- Before/after transformations

### Framework Categories (from linkedin-content skill)
| Category | Animating Principle | Best For |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Engagement** | People want to participate | Opinions, debates, polls |
| **Story** | Emotion drives sharing | Personal experiences, failures |
| **List/Tips** | Scannable = actionable | How-to content, mistakes to avoid |
| **Contrarian** | Pattern interrupts grab attention | Challenging conventional wisdom |
| **Authority** | Expertise builds credibility | Research, data, professional insights |
| **Community** | People want to belong | Celebrations, shoutouts, welcomes |

### Comment-to-Get Strategy
- Hook: 5 options (Steal, Mistakes, Shocking truth, Wish I knew, Controversy)
- 4 bullet benefits
- CTA with keyword (GUIDE, TEMPLATE, TOOLKIT)
- DM funnel system for leads

---

## Anti-Patterns

- External links in main post (put in comments)
- Hashtag overload (3-5 max)
- Too casual/informal voice
- Arrow bullets (→) - AI tell
- Correlative constructions ("isn't just X - it's Y")
- Generic platitudes without specifics

---

## Platform-Specific Voice

- Professional yet conversational
- Thought leadership tone
- Vulnerable but not oversharing
- Specific details over generic claims
- Permission-giving, not preachy

---

## Structure

**Hook → Body → Insight → Question or CTA**

- First 2 lines critical (shows in feed before "see more")
- Line breaks for readability
- End with question to drive comments

---

## Character Limits
- 3,000 character limit
- Optimal: 200-500 words (1,000-2,500 chars)

---

## API Limitations (Get Late)

- **No @mentions via API** - Names appear as plain text; must manually edit post to tag people
- Images supported (ALWAYS include for higher engagement)
- Documents/PDFs supported
- Carousels supported

---

## OpenEd-Specific Notes

- Use for thought leadership content
- Tag guests/contributors (edit manually after posting)
- Repurpose newsletters and podcast insights
- Ela Richmond voice for personal posts

---
