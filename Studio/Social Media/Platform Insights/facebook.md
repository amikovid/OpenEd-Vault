# Facebook - Platform Insights

**Status:** Draft - consolidating from multiple sources

## Success Heuristic

**Comments drive reach** - Facebook's algorithm rewards engagement, especially comments. The goal is to get people talking, not just liking.

The audience here is largely parents already in the program. 80% category content (parenting, education philosophy), 20% program-specific.

## What Works

### Content Types
- Question posts with background images (BEST PERFORMER)
- Text on colorful backgrounds (native feature)
- Simple images with provocative captions
- Engagement bait that invites response

### Formats
- Questions (10-20 words max)
- "Fill in the blank" posts
- This or that choices
- Validation posts ("You're not alone if...")
- Text-on-background using native FB feature

### Text Heavy Sub-Formats (from Notion)
- iPhone notes style
- White text on black background (surprisingly effective)
- Handwritten on graph paper / textured background
- Social media screenshot posts
- "Pop Quiz" format

### Question Post Strategy
- Use Post Planner's question ideas
- Focus on relatable, easy-to-answer prompts
- Example: "What's your favorite homeschool win this week?"

## Anti-Patterns

- External links in main post (KILLS reach)
- Hashtags (Facebook doesn't reward them)
- Too formal/corporate voice
- Long-form content (save for LinkedIn)
- Complex multi-step asks

---

## Platform-Specific Voice

- Informal, playful, personable
- Like talking to a friend
- Validation-heavy ("You're doing great")
- Simple, strong opinions that make you go "MHMMMM"

---

## Guidelines (from Notion)

> "Talk more to parents in the programs. Validate them, build trust. Keep them in our corner, sharing with friends saying, 'OpenEd gets me!'"

The goal is creating content that feels like validation from a friend, not a brand lecturing.

---

## Character Limits
- 40-140 characters optimal
- Question posts: 10-20 words max

---

## API Notes (Get Late)
- Text + images supported
- Videos supported
- Links supported but hurt organic reach
- No hashtag requirement

---

## OpenEd-Specific Notes

- Audience: Parents already enrolled
- Goal: Validation, community, word-of-mouth
- Tone: "We get you" not "Here's what you should do"
- Use dude-with-sign one-liner patterns here
