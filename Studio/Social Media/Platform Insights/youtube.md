# YouTube - Platform Insights

**Status:** Draft - needs more definition

---

## Success Heuristic

**Shorts for reach, long-form for depth** - YouTube Shorts compete with TikTok/Reels for discovery. Long-form builds subscriber loyalty and watch time.

---

## What Works

### Shorts (Discovery)
- Repurpose Reels/TikToks directly
- 15-60 seconds
- Vertical 9:16 format
- Educational hooks
- Include #Shorts tag

### Long-Form (Depth)
- Podcast full episodes
- Deep dive explainers
- Course-style content
- Interview format

### Community Posts
- Polls for engagement
- Behind-the-scenes updates
- Quote cards
- Cross-promote other content

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Shorts without clear topic in first 2 seconds
- Long-form without strong hook/intro
- Ignoring description SEO
- Not using end screens and cards

---

## Platform-Specific Voice

- Slightly more produced than TikTok
- Educational authority
- Consistent format/intro helps recognition
- Thumbnails matter enormously

---

## Specifications

### Shorts
- 9:16 vertical

### Long-Form
