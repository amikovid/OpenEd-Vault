## Part 1: The Big Picture

### What We're Building

**"Content Dropshipping"** - We don't manufacture content from scratch. We source (podcasts, blog archive, newsletters) and repackage (social posts, video clips, ads) using templates and automation.

**The Math:**
- Traditional team: 5-7 people for consistent multi-channel output
- AI-augmented team: 1-2 people producing equivalent output
- Multiplier: 1 podcast = blog + 5 social clips + newsletter segment + X thread

### The Hub-and-Spoke Model

```
         ┌─────────────┐
         │  HUB PIECE  │
         │  (Podcast,  │
         │  Deep Dive, │
         │  Newsletter)│
         └──────┬──────┘
                │
    ┌───────────┼───────────┐
    │           │           │
    ▼           ▼           ▼
┌───────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐
│ Blog  │   │Social │   │ Video │
│ Post  │   │ Posts │   │ Clips │
└───────┘   └───────┘   └───────┘
```

**After completing any hub piece, the system generates spokes automatically.**

**Full matrix:** `Archive/Andrew Muto/FORMAT_EVALUATION_Matrix.md`

### Meta Ads Library (100 Concepts)

**V1 (50 concepts):** Notes App, Text-Over-Video, Reddit/Tweet, Meme, Testimonial, UGC, Carousel, Before/After

**V2 (50 concepts):** Text-Only Static, Split-Screen/Duet, Green Screen Commentary, Ad Reaction, Educational Micro-Series, Partnership Ads

**Key files:**
- `Studio/Meta Ads/50-Ad-Concepts-January-2026.md`
- `Studio/Meta Ads/50-Ad-Concepts-V2-January-2026.md`
- `Studio/Meta Ads/2026-Meta-Ad-Trends-Research.md`

### Calibration Examples (What Works/Doesn't)

**`Studio/Social Media/staging/Content_Concepts.md`** - 105 post options with inline feedback

Markers:
- `{good}` or `[X]` = Replicate this pattern
- `{reject}` = Avoid this pattern
- `{needs context}` = Concept works, execution needs refinement

**Patterns that work:**
- Paradox hooks (contradictions that make you read)
- Concrete numbers + attribution
- "X is overrated. Y is underrated."
- Quote posts with @tags
- Juxtaposition without commentary

**Patterns that fail:**
- Correlative constructions ("isn't just X - it's Z") - THE #1 AI tell
- Tired openers ("Hot take:", "Unpopular opinion:")
- Staccato patterns ("She left. She thrived.")
- Soft endings ("You're probably right too")

### Content Sources (Archive)

| Source | Size | Location |
|--------|------|----------|
| Blog archive | 406 articles | `Master_Content_Index.md` |
| Podcast episodes | 50+ | `Studio/Podcast Studio/` |

|------|-----------|
| **Jan 19-31** | Pre-launch setup (pixel audit, list pulls, creative development) |
| **Feb 10** | Enrollment cycle opens |
| **Feb 16** | **Pillar 1 launches** (11,380 known leads) |
| **Mar 1** | Pillars 2 & 3 launch (website visitors, lookalikes) |

**Creative needs for Pillar 1 (Feb 16):**
- 4-6 ad variations (video + static mix)
- Concepts: "We Saved Your Spot", "Join 17,000+ Families", Parent Testimonials, "Apply in 10 Minutes"

**Your role:** Help produce these ad assets from the 100-concept library.

## Part 4: The Automation Opportunity

### Current State: Manual + Calibration
1. Write posts in staging/Content_Concepts.md
2. Schedule via Social_Scheduling.md
3. Publish via GetLate API

### Target State: Automated + Templated
1. Source material → Router skill identifies format + platform
2. Sub-agents generate options (parallel processing)
3. Markdown staging files auto-created
4. Human QC + tag verification
5. GetLate publishes on schedule

### Staging Workflow (Ready to Use)

```
staging/
├── drafts/      # Work in progress
├── ready/       # Approved, awaiting publish
└── published/   # Archive of sent posts
```

**File format:**

## Part 5: Replicable Formats for Team Handoff

**These are the formats other OpenEd team members can take and run with:**

### Format 1: Text-Only Static Ads (EASIEST)
- Bold text on solid background
- Pattern interrupt in visual-heavy feeds
- Production: 10-15 variations in 1 day (Canva)
- Source: `Studio/Meta Ads/50-Ad-Concepts-V2-January-2026.md` (15 concepts ready)

**Example:**
```
"Maybe the problem
 isn't your kid.
 
 Maybe it's the system."
```

### Format 2: Notes App Screenshots
- iPhone notes app aesthetic
- Feels like real parent discovery
- Production: Near-zero cost, 5 min each
- Source: `Studio/Meta Ads/50-Ad-Concepts-January-2026.md` (8 concepts)

### Format 3: Pointing Format (Video)
- Point to tablet/easel headline, hold 5-8 seconds
- 90-second production, high replay value
- Source: `Archive/Andrew Muto/POINTING_FORMAT_Batch.md` (60 headlines ready)

### Format 4: "Is It Reimbursable?" Series (UNIQUE TO OPENED)
- Hold up item (chicken, garden tools), reveal yes/no + reasoning
- 3-5 minutes per video
- Endless variations, encourages audience participation
- Differentiated - no one else can do this

### Format 5: Quote + Commentary (X/Twitter)
- Featured guest quote + 1-2 line commentary
- Tag the guest for amplification
- Source: `Studio/Nearbound Pipeline/` for handles
- Example from calibration: "Your kid isn't 'bad at school' - school is bad at your kid."

### Format 6: Question Posts (Facebook)
- 10-20 words max, colorful background
- Comments drive algorithmic reach
- Best performer on Facebook
- Examples: "What's one thing about homeschooling you wish you knew sooner?"
