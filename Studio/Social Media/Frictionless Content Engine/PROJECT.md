## Vision

Transform content production from manual creation to **template-driven multiplication**:
1. Define replicable formats per platform
2. Map source material (archive, podcasts, blog) to format inputs
3. Automate the last mile (staging, scheduling, posting)
4. Humans handle quality control and strategic decisions

This is "dropshipping" for content - we don't manufacture from scratch, we source and repackage.

## Platform Strategies

| Platform | Audience | Replicable Format | Source Material |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **X/Twitter** | Intellectual homeschoolers | Quote + link resurfacing | Blog archive, featured guests |
| **YouTube** | Search-driven discovery | Long podcast clips (SEO-matched) | Podcast episodes |
| **Facebook** | Mainstream moms | Ad creative, curricula promo | Curricula, lead magnets |
| **Instagram** | Aesthetic homeschool moms | Faceless educational content | Blog posts, tips |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional educators | Thought leadership posts | Newsletters, deep dives |
| **Pinterest** | Discovery/SEO | Pins linking to articles | All evergreen content |

**Full details:** See `../Platform Insights/` folder.

## Retargeting Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Retargeting Strategy FY26-27** drives 2026 enrollment. Content Engine creative feeds these campaigns.

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Feb 10 | Enrollment tasks open |
| Feb 16 | Launch Pillar 1 (known lead recovery) |
| Mar 1 | Launch Pillars 2 & 3 (website visitors, lookalikes) |

**Creative needs:**
- Pillar 1: 4-6 variations (video + static) - "We Saved Your Spot", testimonials
- Pillar 2/3: Ongoing fresh creative for cold audiences

**Action:** Review `../../Retargeting Strategy FY26-27/PROJECT.md` for full creative matrix.

## Calibration Examples

`Studio/Social Media/staging/Content_Concepts.md` contains 40+ post options with your inline feedback:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `{good}` or `[X]` | Approved pattern - replicate |
| `{reject}` | Doesn't work - avoid |
| `{needs context}` | Concept works, execution needs refinement |

**Example patterns that work:**
- Paradox hooks (contradictions that make you read)
- Concrete numbers + attribution
- "X is overrated. Y is underrated."
- Quote posts with @tags

**Use this file for calibration before generating new content.**

## Content Sources

| Source | Location | Use For |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Blog archive (406 articles) | `../../Master_Content_Index.md` | All resurfacing |
| Podcast episodes | `../../Open Ed Podcasts/` | Clips, quotes, video |
| Newsletter archive | `../../OpenEd Daily/` | LinkedIn, short posts |
| Featured people | `../../Nearbound Pipeline/` | Tagging strategy |

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Template Definition (Q3 Start)
- [ ] Define 3 replicable formats per platform
- [ ] Document input requirements (what source material needed)
- [ ] Review staging/Content_Concepts.md feedback for patterns
- [ ] Estimate production time per format

### Phase 2: Automation Setup (Q3 Mid)
- [ ] Build or configure automation for each format type
- [ ] Connect to content archive / Master_Content_Index.md
- [ ] Set up staging workflow for human review
- [ ] Integrate with Nearbound Pipeline for auto-tagging

### Phase 3: Velocity (Q3 End)
- [ ] 10x content output vs. Q2 baseline
- [ ] <15 min human time per piece (down from hours)
- [ ] Maintain quality bar (no slop)
- [ ] Feed Retargeting campaigns with fresh creative

---

## Key Constraints

1. **No AI slop** - Every piece must pass human quality check
2. **Platform-native** - Content feels native, not cross-posted
3. **Archive-first** - Leverage existing content before creating new
4. **Tag people** - Use Nearbound Pipeline to tag featured guests
5. **Measurable** - Every format has a clear metric

### Meeting Notes (2026-01-20 Onboarding Call)

**Topics Covered:**
- System architecture walkthrough (.claude/skills, CLAUDE.md, NOW.md, PROJECT.md hierarchy)
- Nearbound strategy explained - piggybacking on authorities who have audience trust
- Daily newsletter as surface area multiplier (2,000 active / 20,000 total, HubSpot auto-suppression)
- Havila's outreach workflow after featuring people
- Tools: Canva, Descript (Underlord with Opus), generated video options in Descript

**Curriculove Demo:**
- Quiz flow walkthrough (philosophy → email gate → curriculum cards)
- Meta ads opportunity: Target people who already like specific curricula
- Templated images with curriculum logos = less competition, higher relevance
- Dropshipping logic: Bump ads until ROAS falls below threshold, then refresh creative

**Proven Formats Discussed:**
- "This is your sign" video (performed well historically)
- iPhone Notes format (performs well)
- Lo-fi + relatable text on aesthetic background > heavily produced

**Key Principle Reinforced:**
> "Rule #1: No AI slop, but frictionless replicable formats"

**New Meta Ads Idea to Test:**
Curriculum-specific lookalike audiences - show users the logo/screenshot of a curriculum they already like, positioned as "swipe to find out" or "what kind of homeschooler are you?" Less competition around niche curriculum keywords.

**Tools Mentioned:**
- Canva (primary for graphics, batch processing)
- Descript (Underlord AI editing, generated video via Cling/Pixverse/Sora/Veo)
- CapCut (mentioned but not currently using)
