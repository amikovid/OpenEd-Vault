## The Reality Check

Video content requires knowing what's **producible**, not just what's ideal. This doc defines the actual arsenal - formats we can execute without expensive production.

- Social media reactions
- **Tools:** Screen recording + voice

## Triple Word Score System (from video-caption-creation skill)

Algorithms need topic clarity through 4 signals:

1. **Audio Transcript** - Say topic words in first 10 seconds
2. **On-Screen Text** - Reinforce spoken words visually
3. **Caption Copy** - Topic-relevant keywords in description
4. **Hashtags** - 10-12, broad to specific

When all 4 align, algorithm knows exactly who to serve it to.

---

## Production Workflow

1. **Script/Hook** - Use video-caption-creation skill for hooks
2. **Shot List** - If UGC, send specific requests to families
3. **Capture/Source** - Stock, AI-generated, or filmed
4. **Edit** - CapCut, Descript, or Canva
5. **Captions** - Auto-generate + review
6. **Optimize** - Apply Triple Word Score
7. **Distribute** - Via Get Late API to platforms
