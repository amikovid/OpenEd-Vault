# Social Spokes: Scrolling Is The New Smoking (Jan 27)

---

## LINKEDIN POST 1 (Hot Take)

**Format:** Contrarian opinion

The Minimalists hit half a billion views on social media. Then they quit for an entire year.

Joshua Fields Millburn's takeaway? Most of those views lasted eight-tenths of a second. He started wondering what exactly he was measuring.

Their new TEDx Talk makes a comparison I can't stop thinking about: people who scroll 2+ hours a day are 3x more likely to be diagnosed with depression and 40% more likely to have sleep problems. Those numbers are tobacco-lawsuit territory.

But the solution they propose isn't a ban. It's cultural pressure - the same thing that killed indoor smoking. Treat your phone like a cigarette. When you need to check a message, step outside. Let everyone see you doing it.

The awkwardness is the point. We didn't outlaw cigarettes in restaurants. We just made it embarrassing to light up at the table.

I think about this every time I catch myself scrolling in front of my kids.

What's your phone-as-cigarette moment?

## LINKEDIN POST 2 (Story/Stat)

**Format:** Transformation story

Joshua Fields Millburn pulled his daughter out of school in first grade. She was having anxiety attacks every morning - stomach aches, dread about being forced to read.

Four years later, she was running her own business.

By age 10, she'd started PAWS (Pretty Awesome Walking Service) and has since made thousands of dollars walking dogs at five bucks a pop. No business curriculum. No entrepreneurship class. She learned customer service, scheduling, and reliability because she wanted to - not because it was on the test.

"I feel like it's a job she would do for free anyway," Joshua says. "She's dog sitting at someone's house and she just gets to play with their dog for five hours and then they give her money."

I keep coming back to this: the skills she picked up running PAWS are the same ones parents pay thousands of dollars for summer business camps to teach. She learned them by accident, because nobody was standing between her and something she actually cared about.

## X POST 1 (Standalone)

The Minimalists hit 500 million social media views.

Average view duration: 0.8 seconds.

They quit for a year.

Now they're calling scrolling "the new smoking" - and proposing the same fix: make it embarrassing to do in public.

## X POST 2 (Thread Starter)

Joshua Fields Millburn pulled his daughter out of school in first grade.

She was having anxiety attacks every morning. Stomach aches before the bus came. Dread about being forced to read.

Four years later, she was running her own company. Here's what happened in between:

- 4/ Their TEDx Talk data: 2+ hrs daily scrolling = 3x depression risk, 40% more sleep problems. They want phones treated like cigarettes.
- 5/ Full story drops Thursday on the OpenEd podcast. Joshua goes deep on screens, education, and what happens when you remove all the desks. Link in bio.

## INSTAGRAM CAPTION (Quote Card / Carousel)

**Visual suggestion:** Quote card with "How many square feet of joy do you have in your life?" over a muted background. Or carousel: slide 1 = hook stat, slide 2 = the 0.8 second story, slide 3 = the phone-as-cigarette idea, slide 4 = pleonexia definition, slide 5 = CTA.

The ancient Greeks had a word for what social media runs on: pleonexia.

It means greed for things that can be counted. Views, likes, followers, square footage, GPA.

Joshua Fields Millburn (one half of The Minimalists) asked this in their latest TEDx Talk: "How many square feet of joy do you have in your life? How many yards of peace have I acquired this year?"

After hitting half a billion views - most lasting less than a second - The Minimalists took a full year off social media. And their conclusion is wild: scrolling is the new smoking, and the fix isn't a ban. It's social pressure. Treat your phone like a cigarette. When you need to check it, step outside.
