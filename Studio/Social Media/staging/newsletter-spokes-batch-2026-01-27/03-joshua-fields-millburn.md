## LinkedIn Post 1: Hot Take

**Format:** Contrarian / authority
**Tags:** @JFM @theminimalists

Joshua Fields Millburn built a career around one idea: clutter is anything that gets in the way of a meaningful life.

He applied that to closets, kitchens, garages. Millions of people followed along.

Then his daughter started getting stomach aches every morning before school. She was in a good public school in Montana - Spanish immersion, strong ratings. But she came home worse every day.

They did the dyslexia tests. Ella tested positive. Then Joshua took the same tests - at 40 years old - and found out he was dyslexic too. He'd spent his whole life thinking reading was supposed to be that hard.

The system he'd endured was now hurting his kid. So he did what he teaches everyone else to do: he removed what wasn't working.

They found an unschool. The stomach aches stopped.

"I didn't realize until I had a daughter that I was dyslexic. She was struggling to read. I'm like, well, yeah, reading is just really hard, right? And they're like, no."

Joshua Fields Millburn was 40 when he found out. His daughter Ella was in first grade.

There's a pattern here that parents recognize: the kid who seems fine but dreads school. The one whose body gives the signal before anyone asks the right questions. Stomach aches. Headaches. The slow withdrawal.

Ella was in a well-regarded public school. The family tried everything within the system first. Different strategies, different accommodations. Nothing changed.

What changed was the environment. They pulled her out and found a school built around how she actually learns.

We published the full conversation with Joshua this week. Worth a read whether you're a minimalist or not.

Joshua Fields Millburn didn't know he was dyslexic until age 40.

He found out because his daughter was struggling to read and he thought that was normal.

"Well, yeah, reading is just really hard, right? And they're like, no."

Joshua Fields Millburn helped millions of people declutter their lives through @theminimalists.

Then his daughter started dreading school every morning. Stomach aches before. Stomach aches after.

When the dyslexia tests came back positive - for her AND for him, at age 40 - he realized the system he'd survived was now hurting his kid.

So he did what he teaches: remove what isn't working.

They found an unschool. The stomach aches stopped.
