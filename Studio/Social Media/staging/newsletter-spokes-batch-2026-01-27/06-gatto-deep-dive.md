# Social Spokes: Gatto Deep Dive

## LINKEDIN POST 1 - Hot Take

**Format:** Contrarian opinion

In 1991, the best teacher in New York State quit his job in the Wall Street Journal.

John Taylor Gatto had just won State Teacher of the Year. He'd already won NYC Teacher of the Year three times. Instead of accepting the honor and going back to class, he published an op-ed: "I can't teach this way any longer. If you hear of a job where I don't have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know."

What did he see that others didn't?

He outlined seven lessons that every institutional school teaches - none of them on the syllabus. Confusion (everything out of context). Class position (kids sorted and labeled from age five). Indifference (when the bell rings, stop caring about whatever you were doing). Emotional dependency on teacher approval.

The longer you sit with those seven lessons, the harder they are to unsee.

Every few months, another wave of stories hits about homeschool kids "falling behind." But nobody asks the question Gatto asked 30 years ago: compared to what?

We rewrote and expanded our deep dive on Gatto's life and work. Anyone searching for his name deserves to find the connection between his ideas and what's happening in education right now.

## LINKEDIN POST 2 - Story/Stat

**Format:** Bio narrative

Before John Taylor Gatto ever taught a class, he drove a cab through Manhattan, wrote ad copy on Madison Avenue, designed jewelry, and ghostwrote speeches for Richard Nixon.

This matters.

When he finally entered a classroom, he didn't teach like someone who'd only ever been in classrooms. He sent kids on independent research at public libraries. He arranged for shy 13-year-olds to interview state legislators. He connected students labeled "at-risk" with real apprenticeships.

Those methods earned him NYC Teacher of the Year - three times.

But the disconnect between what schools claimed to do and what he actually observed got worse every year. The system wasn't failing. It was succeeding at something nobody wanted to name out loud.

"Schooling is a form of adoption," he wrote. "You give your kid away at his most plastic years to a group of strangers."

Gatto quit at the peak of his career. The open education movement is his legacy in action.

## X POST 2 - Thread Starter

John Taylor Gatto outlined seven hidden lessons that every school teaches - none of them on the syllabus.

Once you see them, you can't unsee them. [thread]

**Thread 2:** 1. Confusion - everything taught out of context. History separated from literature, math from science, all divided into arbitrary periods marked by bells.

2. Class position - kids sorted and labeled from age five. Gifted, average, remedial. "I'm not a math person" becomes a prophecy.

**Thread 3:** 3. Indifference - when the bell rings, drop whatever you're doing. This teaches kids not to care too deeply about anything.

4. Emotional dependency - "By using stars and red checks, smiles and frowns, I force children to become emotionally dependent upon my praise."

**Thread 4:** And three more that cut deeper - intellectual dependency, provisional self-esteem, and the normalization of constant surveillance.

Gatto said this in his State Teacher of the Year acceptance speech. In front of the people running the system.

**Thread 5:** He won NYC Teacher of the Year three times. Then he quit in the Wall Street Journal.

Before teaching, he drove cabs, wrote ad copy, designed jewelry, and ghostwrote for Nixon. He knew what the "real world" looked like. Schools didn't resemble it.

**Thread 6:** We expanded our deep dive on Gatto - his life, his seven lessons, and why he matters more now than in 1991.
