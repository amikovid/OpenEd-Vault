# Social Spokes: Design Over Delivery

## LINKEDIN POST 1 - Hot Take

**Format:** Contrarian opinion

Michael Horn took two online courses at Harvard. Same platform, same year.

One was brilliant. The other was almost unwatchable.

Parents keep asking "Is online school good or bad?" and that question is about as useful as "Are books good or bad?" The delivery method is neutral. The pedagogy is the variable.

The good course used short video segments with clear storylines, graphics that actually helped, and instructors who showed up when students got stuck. The bad one dumped paragraphs of text onto a screen and called it education.

We keep debating "screens vs. no screens" when the real question is: did anyone actually design this thing? Or did they just upload a textbook to a platform?

If you're evaluating online learning for your family, stop asking about the technology. Ask about the design. Ask whether instructors engage. Ask if someone bothered to think about how students actually learn - or if they just digitized the same broken model.

The medium is not the message. The design is.

## LINKEDIN POST 2 - Story/Stat

**Format:** Personal observation + stat anchor

Julie Bogart (@JulieBogart) has been teaching kids to write for decades. Her latest recommendation sounds almost comically old-fashioned: wordless music, a candle, and writing by hand together as a family.

I laughed when I first read it. Then I thought about it for three days.

Handwriting activates more areas of the brain than typing or voice-to-text. That's not nostalgia - it's neuroscience. The slow, physical act of forming letters anchors memory and creativity in ways keyboards don't replicate.

But the part that hit me: when every digital tool suggests, corrects, and predicts, writing by hand might be the last place a kid can think without algorithmic interference. No red squiggles. No autocomplete. No AI offering to finish the sentence before they've figured out what they're trying to say.

The messiness of original thought requires space that autocomplete won't give you.

I think the most important tech skill for kids in 2026 might be a pencil.

## X POST 2 - Thread Starter

Handwriting might be the most important "tech skill" of 2026.

Not joking.

When every digital tool suggests, corrects, and predicts - writing by hand is the last place a kid can think without algorithmic interference.

@JulieBogart has been saying this for years. Here's what she means: [thread]

**Thread 2:** She recommends wordless music, a candle, and writing together as a family. Sounds like a parody of homeschool cottage-core - until you realize she's describing the exact opposite of everything modern life pushes on kids.

**Thread 3:** Handwriting activates more brain areas than typing or voice-to-text. The slow, deliberate act of forming letters anchors memory and creativity in ways keyboards can't replicate. Not nostalgia. Neuroscience.

**Thread 4:** The messiness of original thought requires space that autocomplete won't give you. No red squiggles. No "did you mean?" No AI finishing the sentence before they know what they're trying to say.

**Thread 5:** We wrote about this (and Michael Horn's opposite-outcome Harvard courses) in today's OpenEd Daily. Link in bio.

Every digital tool your kid uses is trying to finish their sentence.

Autocomplete. Spell check. AI suggestions. The red squiggles. The "did you mean...?"

Julie Bogart's recommendation sounds almost absurdly old-fashioned - wordless music, a candle, writing by hand together as a family. But she's describing something specific: the last place a kid can think without algorithmic interference.

Handwriting lights up more areas of the brain than typing. The slow act of forming letters anchors memory and creativity in ways keyboards can't touch.

The most important tech skill for 2026? Probably a pencil.
