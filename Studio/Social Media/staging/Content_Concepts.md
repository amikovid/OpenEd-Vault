## CATEGORY 1: Heavy-Hitting One-Liners (Evergreen, No Links)

**1.**
> Roger Federer wins 54% of points played. School would give him an F.
 {this into a New Yorker cartoon where the teacher is telling Roger Federer, "We need some sort of percentage." We've got to make it obvious. It's almost like a political cartoon, but New Yorker style, a little more right. }
**2.**
> 1 in 4 teenage boys are now diagnosed with ADHD. Maybe the system needs the diagnosis.
 {This one's good. }
**3.**
> Teen anxiety spikes every August and drops every June. {What could possibly be behind this?} - The image to the graph and follow-up tweet, maybe tag Peter Gray and link to the article. 

**4.**
> Schools still follow a farmer's calendar. Nobody farms anymore. {This is a good concept, but we need a different framing, a different format. }

**5.**

{We should have the alternating caps, "but what about socialization!?"? }
> Your kid spent 6 hours today with people born within 12 months of them. That's weird.

**6.**
> "It's not you. It's the curriculum."
>
> The most freeing sentence a struggling kid can hear.

Jack. reject 

**7.**
 
To everyone who questions homeschool parents: Chicago has dozens of schools with zero percent math proficiency. Zero.

We can do better than zero.

**8.**
> We put kids on stimulants so they can sit still in a system designed in 1840. {is a good one. I might like to think about how we could add some visuals. }

**9.**
> Bullying is so common in schools we call it a rite of passage. Common isn't normal. {reject }

**10.**
> The "socialization" question has it backwards. Schools socialize you for one peer group that disappears at graduation.
{one feels like it needs another clause. }
**11.**
> When your kid graduates, their coworkers will be ages 22 to 65. When did school prepare them for that?
{We, could probably merge this in with the previous one. }
**12.**
> "I got tenure so they couldn't fire me. So I quit." — Neuroscientist turned homeschool mom
{This is a great example of a very bad tweet that does not have nearly enough context. However, if we wanted to identify who it is, it's Claire Honeycott. This could be a good one, but we'd need to workshop it quite a bit. }
**13.**
> The bell rings mid-sentence. You learn not to care about things. This is by design.

{This one's almost decent, but I feel like it doesn't, again, doesn't have enough context. The setup is not quite there. }

**14.**
> Your kid's Chromebook was designed by the same people who designed slot machines. ~~Same reward loops.~~
{Let's submit an iPad here. and maybe educational app. I don't know. That might be too, that's probably too inflammatory. }

**15.**
> "What other product do you pay for in advance and celebrate when it's not delivered?"
Who is this quote from? We need the context here. This could be good if it's from a podcast. We could do it as a podcast clip. For some of these, it seems like you should be suggesting podcast clips, which is okay. 
**16.**
> William Torrey Harris, Education Commissioner under four U.S. Presidents:
>
> "Ninety-nine out of a hundred are automata. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education."

I can totally see this one as a reel where we somehow use 11 Labs or some kind of automation. That's a different category, and we could try that, but I don't know, interesting idea. 

**17.**
> The hidden curriculum: Confusion. Class position. Indifference. Dependency. Surveillance.
>
> The things actually being taught.
{Eject. }

**18.**
> LeBron shoots 50%. Simone Biles medals 61% of events. Tom Brady completes 64%.
>
> School would fail all of them.

**19.**
> "Good students wait for teachers to tell them what to do."
>
> That's not intelligence. That's obedience.

{has correlative construction, so it's not good. }

**20.**
> Your kid is "obsessed" with one topic. Don't fix it. That's how they'll learn everything else.

---

## CATEGORY 2: Contrarian Takes

**21.**
> ~~Unpopular opinion:~~ The "weird homeschooler" stereotype describes normal human development.
>
> Age-segregated, bell-scheduled, standardized schooling - that's weird.

{Remove "Unpopular opinion:" - tired opener. Concept is good.}

**22.**
> We diagnose kids with attention problems, then put them in an environment specifically designed to fragment attention into 50-minute blocks.

{Good. Clean irony, no correlatives.}

**23.**
> The argument for school socialization:
> - 6 hours with same-age peers
> - Supervised by adults
> - Minimal mixed-age interaction
> - Relationships end at graduation
>
> The argument against it is the same list.

{The twist is clever. Could work as an image with the list, caption "The argument for and against school socialization."}

**24.**
> ~~Hot take:~~ Deep obsession with a single topic is ~~a feature, not a bug~~.
>
> A kid who spent a year obsessed with fishing learned how to learn. Then picked up calculus in weeks.

{Remove "Hot take:" - tired. "Feature not a bug" is overused tech metaphor. The fishing→calculus story is the good part. Lead with that?}

**25.**
> Personalized curriculum is a gateway drug to independent thinking.

{Good one-liner. Might work as image text.}

**26.**
> We treat summer as "learning loss."
>
> Meanwhile, teen mental health measurably improves every June.

{Similar to #3. Visual: graph showing inverse relationship. Follow-up could link to research.}

**27.**
> ~~"But what about structure?"~~
> "bUt WhAt AbOuT sTrUcTuRe??"
>
> The structure of school was designed for factory efficiency, not human flourishing.

{Use alternating caps for the question. Makes it clear we're mocking the concern.}

**28.**
> Credentialism is insurance for employers who don't know how to evaluate talent.

{Punchy. Might need follow-up with example (Kade Hinkle, etc.)}

## CATEGORY 3: New Yorker-Style Cartoon Concepts

{These could be commissioned illustrations, AI-generated concepts, or partner with a cartoonist. Political cartoon style but New Yorker dry wit.}

**29.** *[CARTOON: Four 12-year-olds standing next to each other - one is 6'4", one is 4'6", wildly different sizes]*
> Caption: "All normal. One curriculum."

{Good. Clear visual absurdity.}

**30.** *[CARTOON: Farmer in overalls looking at calendar, confused, while kid in modern clothes holds a laptop]*
> Caption: "Why do we still follow his schedule?"

{This is the visual treatment for #4 (farmer's calendar concept).}

**31.** *[CARTOON: Report card with all F's, but the student is holding Olympic gold medals]*
> Caption: "How school would grade the GOATs"

{This is the visual treatment for #1 (Federer concept). Per your note - could be teacher handing Federer a report card saying "We need to talk about your percentage."}

**32.** *[CARTOON: Slot machine and a school Chromebook side by side, same blinking lights and reward sounds]*
> Caption: "Same engineers, same psychology"

{Per your note on #14 - maybe iPad instead of Chromebook.}

**33.** *[CARTOON: Line graph showing anxiety spiking August 1, dropping June 1, repeating yearly]*
> Caption: "Researchers still searching for the cause"

{This is the visual treatment for #3. Could be actual graph image + caption.}

**34.** *[CARTOON: Kid at desk being handed pill bottle. Caption on bottle reads "So you can sit still in a chair designed in 1840"]*
> No caption needed.

{Strong. Visual treatment for #8.}

**35.** *[CARTOON: Adult at first job surrounded by coworkers ages 25-60, looking terrified]*
> Caption: "But he was socialized"

{Good. Connects to #5, #10, #11.}

**36.** *[CARTOON: Teacher hitting pause on student's passionate explanation, saying "Bell rang"]*
> Caption: "How we teach indifference"

{Good concept. Relates to #13.}

**37.** *[CARTOON: Parent and kid at zoo. Parent: "Look at those animals all grouped by birth year!" Kid: "That's not how zoos work." Parent: "Exactly."]*

{Clever. Dialogue format is trickier to execute visually.}

**38.** *[CARTOON: Two paths diverging - one labeled "Fix the schools" leading to construction site, one labeled "Fix the kids" leading to pharmacy]*
> Caption: "Guess which one we chose"

{Strong. Clear visual metaphor.}

## CATEGORY 4: Featured Posts (With Links)

{These already have guest tags. Verify all handles before posting.}

**39.**
> A school librarian with 5,000 books raised two daughters.
>
> One read at 12th-grade level in kindergarten. The other couldn't read at all.
>
> Same books. Same read-alouds. Same mom.
>
> @EverydayReading on what actually worked: [link]

{Good story structure. Already scheduled in previous batch.}

**40.**
> @ben_m_somers' town when he was 11:
> - Almost 25% of boys on stimulants
> - Ben was one of them: 70mg Concerta for tapping his foot
>
> The medication was prescribed to make the classroom manageable.
>
> [link]

{Strong. The "tapping his foot" detail is specific and damning.}

**41.**
> Curriculum is overrated. Friends are underrated.
>
> @ben_m_somers on Synthesis: They spent $10M/year on educational content. The #1 predictor of whether a kid stayed? Whether they had a friend in class.
>
> [link]

{Already scheduled. Contrast Evaluation template done right.}

**42.**
> @AnjanKatta on what makes a good screen for kids:
>
> "More interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard."
>
> [link]

*Follow-up tweet suggestion:* Tag @daylightco - they make screens designed for this.

{Already scheduled.}

**43.**
> Why won't my ADHD kid listen?
>
> @amylawsonmoore: Their prefrontal cortex shuts down when you raise your voice. It's called auditory exclusion - stress makes the brain only process danger, not words.
>
> Lower your voice. They'll start hearing you.
>
> [link]

{Good practical advice. "auditory exclusion" is the specific term that makes this credible. Could also be a REEL with voiceover.}

**44.**
> Attention is overrated. Working memory is underrated.
>
> @amylawsonmoore studied 5,000 kids with ADHD. The weakest skill wasn't attention - it was working memory, processing speed, and long-term memory.
>
> [link]

{Good. Contrast Evaluation + specific research. Could be a PODCAST CLIP if she says this on the episode.}

**45.**
> @William_Blake on why the Thiel Fellowship has a better track record than Y Combinator at producing billion-dollar companies:
>
> Naive audacity.
>
> George Dantzig solved two "unsolvable" math problems because nobody told him they were impossible.
>
> [link]

{Already scheduled. The Dantzig story is the hook.}

**46.**
> John Taylor Gatto was named New York State Teacher of the Year.
>
> Then he published this in the Wall Street Journal:
>
> "I can't teach this way any longer. If you hear of a job where I don't have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know."
>
> [link]

{Strong. The juxtaposition of "Teacher of the Year" + "hurt kids to make a living" is powerful. REEL potential with dramatic reading?}

**47.**
> Daniella Park:
> - Dyslexic
> - Dropped out
> - Became a top chef
> - Founded Baketivity
>
> Her advice: "Say yes to everything. Most times it works. Sometimes it kills you. But it always gives you lessons."
>
> [link]

{List format is borderline AI-ish, but the quote is strong. Maybe lead with the quote instead? Need to find her X handle - try @PrimalBaketivity or search.}

**48.**
> "Is that even allowed?"
>
> Darryl Stinson's reaction when someone told him he could pull his kids from school for educational travel.
>
> Now his daughter starts a new business every 90 days.
>
> [link]

{Good. "Is that even allowed?" is relatable. Need to find Darryl's X handle.}

---

## CATEGORY 5: Thread Starters (First Tweet + Suggested Follow-Up)

**49.**
> The things school actually teaches (according to John Taylor Gatto, who was named NYC Teacher of the Year):
>
> ~~A thread~~

*Follow-up tweets:*
> 1. Confusion - fragmented knowledge with no connections between subjects
> 2. Class position - labels like "gifted" or "remedial" become permanent identity
> 3. Indifference - the bell rings mid-passion, you learn not to care
> 4. Emotional dependency - your worth = grades = external validation
> 5. Intellectual dependency - "good students" wait to be told what to do
> 6. Provisional self-esteem - you are what you score
> 7. Surveillance - constant monitoring makes freedom feel uncomfortable

*Final tweet:* This wasn't his opinion. He taught this way for 30 years. Then quit.

{The numbered list feels AI-ish. Could work better as CAROUSEL/SLIDES - one per lesson - or a REEL with voiceover. Remove "A thread" - just let it be a thread. The final tweet is strong.}

**50.**
> Kids change more between ages 10-14 than they do from birth to 3.
>
> Here's what we do about it:

*Follow-up:*
> We put them all in one classroom with one curriculum.
>
> One kid is 6'4" playing varsity sports. Another is 4'6" still playing with dolls. Both normal. Both same class.

{Good setup/payoff structure. Connects to cartoon #29.}

**51.**
> The "learning loss" narrative is missing something.
>
> Teen ER visits for anxiety drop every June.
> Psychiatric hospitalizations decline in summer.
> Both spike in August.
>
> ~~We measure learning. We don't measure this.~~

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION in last line. Rewrite: "We measure one. We ignore the other." or just end with "Both spike in August." and let it land.}

**52.**
> ~~Everyone asks about homeschool "socialization."~~
> "bUt WhAt AbOuT sOcIaLiZaTiOn??"
>
> Here's what school socialization actually produces:

*Follow-up:*
> - 6 hours daily with only your birth-year peers
> - One teacher per 25+ kids
> - Relationships that end at graduation
> - Zero experience with mixed-age groups
> - First job: surrounded by ages 22-65, terrified

{Use alternating caps per #5 note. List is fine here because it's the punchline.}

---

## CATEGORY 6: Question Posts (Engagement Drivers)

**53.**
> ~~Genuine question:~~ At what age did you stop loving learning?

{Remove "Genuine question:" - soft opener. Just ask it directly.}

**54.**
> Your kid is "obsessed" with one topic - dinosaurs, Minecraft, fishing, whatever.
>
> Do you:
> A) Redirect to "well-rounded" subjects
> B) Let it run and see what happens
>
> ~~(There's research on this. The answer might surprise you.)~~

{Remove the teaser line - AI-ish. The poll format is fine. Follow-up tweet could share the research.}

**55.**
> When was the last time you spent 6 hours with only people born in your exact birth year?
>
> Why do we think that's healthy for kids?

{Good. No changes needed. Connects to #5.}

**56.**
> What do Roger Federer, LeBron James, Simone Biles, and Tom Brady have in common?
>
> School would give them all F's.

{Good. Setup/punchline. Variant of #1 and #18.}

**57.**
> If sitting still for 6 hours is healthy, why is every adult who works from home switching to standing desks?

{Good. Simple irony.}

**58.**
> ~~Parents: When you picture your kid's education, do you picture:~~
> ~~A) A classroom~~
> ~~B) Something else~~
>
> ~~What's the "something else"?~~

{REJECT. Too soft, sounds like a focus group. Replace with something more pointed?}

---

## CATEGORY 7: Quote + Commentary

**59.**
> "Ninety-nine out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in prescribed paths. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education."
>
> — William Torrey Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education under four presidents
>
> He wasn't criticizing the system. He was describing its purpose.

{Strong. The commentary line is the punchline. Same quote as #16 but with better framing. REEL potential with 11Labs voice reading quote + text reveal of who said it.}

**60.**
> "When children are young, you can see the love of learning in their eyes. Too often, that light dims with each passing year of schooling."
>
> — John Taylor Gatto, after being named NYC Teacher of the Year
>
> ~~The award-winning teacher saw the problem clearly.~~

{Remove last line - soft/preachy. Let the quote + attribution do the work.}

**61.**
> "There isn't a right way to become educated; there are as many ways as fingerprints."
>
> — John Taylor Gatto

{Quote alone is fine but might not have enough punch for X. Consider pairing with a visual or adding context about who said it.}

**62.**
> "You never want your children to be the kind of people who only feel comfortable around their own age."
>
> — T.K. Coleman @TKColeman
>
> Because when they graduate, that artificial neighborhood disappears.

{Good. The follow-up line adds value. Verify @TKColeman is correct handle.}

**63.**
> "When normal is broken, weird wins."
>
> — Matt Barnes
>
> ~~The homeschool kids aren't weird. The system is.~~

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION in commentary. Rewrite: "The system is broken. The 'weird' kids are winning." or just let the quote stand alone.}

**64.**
> "The biggest problem in education today is the assumption that there is one perfect way to learn that suits all children everywhere under all conditions."
>
> — Dr. Claire Honeycutt, neuroscientist turned homeschool mom

{Good. No commentary needed - the quote is complete. This is the same person from #12 (tenure quote). Could be a thread: two quotes from her, then link to episode.}

---

## CATEGORY 8: Stats-Driven Posts

**65.**
> Homeschooling numbers:
> - 1980s: 250,000 students
> - 2019: 2.5 million students
> - 2024: 3.5 million students
>
> The market is speaking.

{Good. Could be a visual - bar chart with dates. "The market is speaking" is punchy ending.}

**66.**
> Video-based learning stats:
> - 85% of students prefer video-first
> - 66% more assignment completion
> - 53% higher exam scores
>
> And yet most schools still lecture.

{Good contrast. Needs source citation in follow-up. Visual: infographic with these stats.}

**67.**
> Online courses with live community: 2-3% dropout rate
> Online courses purely self-paced: 30%+ dropout rate
>
> ~~It's not the content. It's the connection.~~
>
> (h/t Ray Ravaglia, Stanford Online High School founder)

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION. Rewrite last line: "Connection beats content." or "Community makes the difference."}

**68.**
> Legally homeschooled students are 40% less likely to die from child abuse or neglect than the average student nationally.
>
> The "regulation for safety" argument doesn't survive contact with data.

{Strong. This counters a major anti-homeschool talking point. Need source ready for follow-up.}

**69.**
> Public school enrollment: down 1.2 million across 37 states since 2020.
>
> Homeschooling: up 1 million in the same period.
>
> ~~Parents are voting with their feet.~~

{Remove cliché ending. Let the numbers speak. Or: "The market spoke."}

---

## CATEGORY 9: Provocative Reframes

**70.**
> ~~We don't have an ADHD epidemic.~~
>
> ~~We have a "sit still for 6 hours in a system designed for factory workers" epidemic.~~

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION. Rewrite: "The ADHD epidemic is a 'sit still for 6 hours' epidemic." or "1 in 4 boys diagnosed with ADHD. Maybe the chairs are the problem."}

**71.**
> The NYT: "Homeschooled kids are not alright"
>
> Also the NYT, three weeks earlier: "America's children are unwell. Are schools part of the problem?"
>
> Compared to what, exactly?

{Already scheduled (variant). Strong. The juxtaposition does the work.}

**72.**
> ~~School doesn't prepare you for the real world.~~
>
> ~~It prepares you for more school.~~

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION. Rewrite: "School prepares you for more school. That's it."}

**73.**
> "Learning loss" implies you can only learn in school.
>
> Kids who left school and started businesses: confused by this framing.

{Good. The second line is the punch.}

**74.**
> Mandatory reporters in schools miss abuse too.
>
> The argument that homeschoolers need more oversight assumes schools have oversight. They don't.

{Good counter-argument. Could use specific stats in follow-up if available.}

**75.**
> The phrase "gifted and talented" creates a permanent class system.
>
> You're either born smart or you're not. That's the message.
>
> ~~It's also wrong.~~

{Remove "It's also wrong" - soft ending. The message itself is the indictment.}

---

## CATEGORY 10: Absurdist Observations

**76.**
> ~~Imagine explaining school to an alien:~~
>
> "We group children by birth year, ring bells every 50 minutes, and teach subjects in isolation from each other or any real-world application."
>
> "Why?"
>
> "...Tradition?"

{"Explain X to an alien" format is overused. The dialogue itself is fine - could just present it without the alien framing.}

**77.**
> We tell kids screens are bad.
> We hand them Chromebooks.
> We're confused when they're addicted.

{Good. Simple, three-line irony. No correlatives.}

**78.**
> "Professional development" for teachers:
>
> Hours of training on managing 30 kids in a room designed for 15.
>
> Zero training on maybe not putting 30 kids in a room designed for 15.

{Good observation. Structural critique.}

**79.**
> Every adult workplace has:
> - Standing desks
> - Walking meetings
> - Movement breaks
> - Flexible schedules
>
> Every school has:
> - Sit down
> - Be quiet
> - Follow the bell

{Good contrast. Could be a visual - split screen comparison. Or REEL showing adult office vs classroom.}

**80.**
> We medicate kids so they can tolerate an environment we wouldn't tolerate ourselves.

{Strong one-liner. This is #8 and #34 distilled to one sentence.}

---

## CATEGORY 11: Story Snippets

**81.**
> Matt Bowman's daughter, junior year at a traditional high school:
>
> "My friends are all on anxiety medication for tests. The pressure is crazy. I'm forgetting stuff."
>
> ~~She left. She thrived.~~
>
> ~~The system was the problem.~~

{Staccato ending + soft conclusion. Let the quote do the work. Maybe follow-up: "She left. Now she's [specific outcome]." Or just: "She left."}

**82.**
> Cassie Shepherd pulled her twins out of first grade after the principal said:
>
> "Your child is one of many."
>
> Her words: "The second we brought them home, their lights went back on."

{Good. Specific quote from principal is damning. "lights went back on" is strong image.}

**83.**
> Laura Feller, when she started homeschooling:
>
> "Can I help him? Do I have the ability? Do I have the resources? Am I enough?"
>
> Her answer now: "Yes. I am enough."
>
> ~~You probably are too.~~

{REJECT soft ending "You probably are too." Either let her story stand, or make it a REEL with her speaking. The direct address to reader undercuts the story.}

**84.**
> Aiden Prout: 17 years old, garden entrepreneur, $150K first year.
>
> ~~Not despite skipping traditional school. Because of it.~~

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION. Rewrite: "He skipped traditional school. That's how."}

**85.**
> Kade Hinkle: 18 years old, no degree, $100K+ tech job.
>
> Employers asked what he could do. Nobody asked for his diploma.

{Good. Concrete example. Find his X handle?}

**86.**
> Dorothy Jean Tillman II earned her doctorate at 17.
>
> The age requirements are made up.

{Good. Punchy ending.}

---

## CATEGORY 12: Permission-Giving Posts

{This whole category trends soft/preachy. Be selective.}

**87.**
> Your kid doesn't fit the system.
>
> ~~Good. The system wasn't designed for humans. It was designed for efficiency.~~

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION ("wasn't designed for X, was designed for Y"). Rewrite: "The system was designed for efficiency, not humans. Your kid is fine."}

**88.**
> You don't need a teaching degree to know what's best for your child's education.
>
> ~~You already know more than you think.~~

{Remove soft ending. First sentence is strong on its own.}

**89.**
> If your kid is struggling with math, it might not be your kid.
>
> It might be the curriculum.
>
> Try a different one before you diagnose a problem.

{Good. Practical + permission. This is #6 expanded (which you rejected). Does the practical advice save it?}

**90.**
> The "weird homeschooler" your kid might become:
>
> - Comfortable talking to adults
> - Knows what they're interested in
> - Can teach themselves anything
> - Not burned out by age 18
>
> ~~Sounds fine to me.~~

{List is okay here - it's flipping an insult. Remove soft ending. Maybe: "The horror."}

**91.**
> You're allowed to:
> - Pull your kid out mid-year
> - Try something different
> - Change curriculum if it's not working
> - Let them sleep in
> - Follow their interests
>
> ~~You're the parent.~~

{List feels AI-ish. "You're the parent" is soft. Could work better as: "Things nobody told me I could do:" [list] - more personal angle.}

---

## CATEGORY 13: Meta / Pattern Recognition

**92.**
> Pattern: The people most critical of homeschooling have never tried it.
>
> The people most enthusiastic about it have.

{Good observation. Simple pattern recognition.}

**93.**
> Notice how "socialization" is only a concern for homeschoolers?
>
> Not for the bullied kid. Not for the anxious kid. Not for the kid with no friends in class.
>
> Only for the one who left.

{Strong. The specific examples (bullied, anxious, no friends) make it concrete.}

**94.**
> The same people who say "let kids be kids" also say:
>
> - Start academics earlier
> - More homework
> - Teach to the test
> - Less recess
>
> Pick one.

{Good. Exposing contradiction. "Pick one" is punchy ending.}

**95.**
> Weird that "alternative education" is the alternative.
>
> Age-segregated classrooms, arbitrary bells, fragmented subjects - that's only 150 years old.
>
> The "alternative" is actually the original.

{Good reframe. Historical context flip.}

---

## CATEGORY 14: Taggable Takes (Featuring People)

{Verify all handles before posting.}

**96.**
> Peter Gray (@peter_gray_play) has tracked this for years:
>
> Every fall when school starts, teen mental health tanks. ER visits spike.
>
> Every summer, it gets better.
>
> We keep ignoring this.

{Good. Per your note on #3, this connects to the anxiety graph. Verify handle - might be @PeterGrayPhD or similar.}

**97.**
> .@~~coreydeangel~~ @DeAngelisCorey on Chicago schools with 0% math proficiency:
>
> "You can do better than zero percent."
>
> Hard to argue with that.

{Fix handle to @DeAngelisCorey (per earlier research). Good.}

**98.**
> .@MichaelBHorn on what's actually happening:
>
> "Parents are cobbling it together. A little from the microschool, sports here, this tutor there."
>
> The unbundling is already underway.

{Good. Verify handle. "The unbundling" is a strong concept.}

**99.**
> Ray Ravaglia built Stanford Online High School.
>
> His biggest insight: "If we could connect them with other students, that's what would keep them engaged for years."
>
> ~~It was never about the content. It was always about connection.~~

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION. Rewrite: "Connection. That's what mattered." or just end with his quote.}

**100.**

## CATEGORY 15: Wild Cards / Outside the Box

**101.**
> ~~Your kid's "screen addiction" isn't about screens.~~
>
> ~~It's about an environment so boring that variable reward loops are more interesting than real life.~~
>
> ~~Fix the environment.~~

{CORRELATIVE CONSTRUCTION. But the insight is good. Rewrite: "Screen addiction is an environment problem. Kids choose variable reward loops because real life is boring. Fix the environment."}

**102.**
> Every generation thinks they invented teenage rebellion.
>
> But teenage rebellion was invented by age-segregated schooling.
>
> Before that, 14-year-olds worked alongside adults. They had responsibilities. They belonged.

{Good insight. Historical reframe. Well-structured.}

**103.**
> The weirdest thing about school isn't the bells or the grades.
>
> It's that we expect kids to be passionate about subjects they didn't choose, taught by people they didn't pick, on a schedule that ignores their biology.
>
> Then we're surprised when they check out.

{Good. Long but coherent. Might work better broken into a thread or REEL.}

**104.**
> Homeschool parents get asked "bUt WhAt AbOuT sOcIaLiZaTiOn??" approximately 47 times per week.
>
> School parents never get asked "But what about the bullying? The anxiety? The 1 in 4 ADHD diagnosis rate?"

{Good contrast. Added alternating caps per earlier pattern. "47 times" is specific humor.}

**105.**
> Your kid doesn't need to be "well-rounded."
>
> They need to be interested in something. Anything.
>
> Deep beats wide.

{Good. "Deep beats wide" is punchy ending. Could be image text.}
