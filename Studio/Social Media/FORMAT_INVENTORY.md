## TEXT POST FORMATS (X/LinkedIn)

**For full methodology and 360+ templates:** Invoke `text-content` skill.

Below are OpenEd's highest-performing patterns for quick reference.

### A. Contrarian Takes
Challenge conventional wisdom without correlative constructions.

**Pattern:** [Observation] + [Ironic twist]

- "We diagnose kids with attention problems, then put them in environments designed to fragment attention into 50-minute blocks."
- "Personalized curriculum is a gateway drug to independent thinking."

---

### B. Question Posts (Engagement Drivers)
Direct questions that provoke response.

- "At what age did you stop loving learning?"
- "When was the last time you spent 6 hours with only people born in your exact birth year?"
- "If sitting still for 6 hours is healthy, why is every adult switching to standing desks?"

---

### C. Quote + Commentary
Authority quote with punchy framing.

- [Gatto quote on teaching] + "He wasn't criticizing the system. He was describing its purpose."
- [Harris "automata" quote] + "The U.S. Commissioner of Education under four presidents. This was the goal."

---

### D. Featured Posts (With Links/Tags)
Story setup, guest tag, link to content.

**Pattern:** Hook > Specific detail > Attribution > Link

---

### E. Thread Starters
First tweet opens loop, follow-ups deliver value.

**Strong openers:**
- "Kids change more between ages 10-14 than they do from birth to 3. Here's what we do about it:"
- "The 'learning loss' narrative is missing something."

---

## HARD RULES: WHAT TO REJECT

### Never Use
- **Correlative constructions:** "X isn't Y - it's Z" or "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- **Tired openers:** "Hot take:", "Unpopular opinion:", "Genuine question:"
- **Soft endings:** "You're probably right too", "It's also wrong"
- **AI-isms:** delve, comprehensive, leverage, landscape, navigate, foster
- **Staccato patterns:** "She left. She thrived. The system was the problem."
- **"Explain X to an alien"** format

### Preferred Alternatives
- **For correlatives:** Make it a single statement ("The system was designed for efficiency, not humans.")
- **For tired openers:** Just state the take directly
- **For soft endings:** Let the content land without commentary
- **For mocking questions:** Use alternating caps ("bUt WhAt AbOuT sOcIaLiZaTiOn??")

---

## WHAT WORKS WELL

### User Likes
- Stats + provocative one-liner
- Direct address openers ("To everyone who...")
- Visual concepts (cartoons, graphs, reels)
- Alternating caps for mocking ("bUt WhAt AbOuT...")
- Specific damning details ("tapping his foot" for ADHD story)
- Juxtaposition without commentary (let contrast speak)

### Strong Endings
- "The market is speaking."
- "Pick one."
- "The requirements are made up."
- "Deep beats wide."

## MINDLESS EXECUTION REMINDERS

From Andrew Muto's 15-Minute Rule:
1. Jump in mindlessly
2. Complete first version rapidly (don't evaluate while creating)
3. 90% is enough (last 10% takes 2.5x time)
4. Edit the completed work (easier than blank page)
5. "Bing bing bing - fuck it, it's done"

**McDonald's Test on Every Hook:** Would a McDonald's worker understand this instantly? If NO → simplify.
