# Andrew Muto Notes Audit

Synthesis of practitioner wisdom from Andrew Muto consulting sessions. These insights should inform the short-form-video skill and related content creation workflows.

## Core Philosophy

### "Sponge Then Sharpen"

The creative process has two distinct phases:

1. **Sponge Phase**: Be malleable, try different things, hunt for what works
   - Don't build processes until you know what's working
   - McDonald's analogy: "You don't build a franchise system if you're not already selling a billion cheeseburgers"
   - This phase feels chaotic - that's normal for creative work

2. **Sharpen Phase**: Once something works, triple down
   - "I'm not gonna sleep, and I'm gonna make 15,000 of these videos"
   - Build process AFTER proving the format works
   - Lock in what's working, then scale

**Key insight**: Corporate types panic in the sponge phase and try to apply "business leadership shit" - but you can't dictate creative success into existence.

## The Hook: First 1-3 Seconds

### The McDonald's Test

If a truck driver wouldn't understand your hook, it's too complicated. Accessible language wins.

### Hook Categories That Work

1. **Polarizing statements** - Challenge assumptions ("George Washington was a screw-up")
2. **Counter-intuitive claims** - "The battery that lasts forever"
3. **Direct challenges** - "If your kid hates school, please watch this"
4. **Curiosity gaps** - "The second person theory"
5. **List formats** - "5 reasons..." (add on-screen numbers with ding sounds)

### Hook Construction

- The hook doesn't need to be *in* the video - it can be the on-screen text
- Find a "gimmick" or "device" you can reuse (Jordan The Stallion's "come here" whisper)
- The punchline often works better at the BEGINNING, not the end
- If clip has no satisfying ending, add "Check description for how she solved it"

### Examples of Strong Hooks

- "This 6th grader's marketing pitch is genius"
- "From screw-up to legend" 
- "They ate me for lunch" → simplified to "They hate me"
- "Don't hire a middle-aged man from Google. That's creepy. Instead, hire me."

## Algorithm Optimization (Triple Word Score)

Stack these four elements - algorithm indexes ALL of them:

1. **Audio transcript** (what's actually said)
2. **On-screen text** (captions, titles, graphics)
3. **Caption/description** (the text below)
4. **Hashtags** (still matter on some platforms)

### Caption Best Practices

- Less text on screen at a time
- Larger, clearer captions
- Check mobile preview - desktop editing often looks different
- Captions should match what people expect (study successful podcast clips)

---

## Click-Through Rate (YouTube)

### Target Metrics
- Below 4%: Low (fix title/thumbnail)
- 4-6%: Ideal range
- Above 6%: Excellent

### Key Insight

Low view counts usually mean bad **packaging** (title/thumbnail), not bad content. People never even watched it - they swiped away.

**Fix**: Try the same video with different titles/thumbnails. Space them out over weeks. A/B test.

---

## Content Categories

### What Works for Short-Form

1. **Emotional stories** - Vulnerability, struggle, comeback
2. **Science/Psychology hooks** - "The second person theory"
3. **How-to/Tips formats** - "5 snacks that don't melt in the car"
4. **Podcast clips** - Best moments from longer content
5. **Polarizing takes** - (within comfortable boundaries)

### The Tips & Tricks Format

- Easy to produce: "Top 5 tools for X"
- People feel like they're getting value even if they don't act on it
- Risk: May attract cheap views that don't build brand loyalty
- Solution: Use tips to attract audience, hold them with philosophy/personality

### Multiple Content Pillars

Don't limit yourself to one format. Build multiple:
- Green screen commentary
- Expert mom UGC
- Faceless with B-roll
- Podcast clips
- Historical/educational

Each pillar can have its own hook style and methodology.

---

## Production Methodology

### Friction Elimination

- Try it yourself first before involving others
- "Brute force with myself first, even if it doesn't get published"
- Find what's special about YOU (homestead lifestyle, cowboy for 50 years, etc.)
- The less friction, the more volume you can produce

### The 15-Minute Rule

If you're working on short-form content for longer than 15 minutes, that's a warning sign. Get it done, get out of your own way.

### Prototype Fast

- Just get a version done - you don't have to publish it
- "90% good, last 10% would take 2.5 hours - not worth it"
- You're a better editor than blank-page creator - get the draft done first

### Split-Screen Tactic

- One half: talking head or podcast clip
- Other half: "oddly satisfying" footage (laffy taffy machine, hot metal balls through foam, horse grooming ASMR)
- Keeps lizard brain engaged while delivering content

---

## Platform-Specific Insights

### YouTube

- 8+ minutes gets additional ad breaks (algorithm may favor)
- Thumbnails: Show expressive faces, dial everything to 11
- Consider stock photos over hand-drawn illustrations
- Revise title/thumbnail later - can "restart" performance

### Instagram

- Reels get 2-3x reach of static posts
- Carousels mostly shown to existing audience, not discovery
- Can flex up to 60 seconds
- Use "restyle" feature in Edits for AI characters

### TikTok

- Similar content to Instagram Reels
- Faceless accounts with clip compilations can work (often backed by podcast sponsorship deals)
- Can publish 4-5 times daily and see growth

### Facebook

- Comments drive reach
- Algo doesn't understand negative sentiment - angry comments still boost video
- "No one says nice things on Facebook"

---

## Title & Thumbnail Principles

### Title Construction

- Every word after the hook is a filter that narrows audience
- "Five dyslexia myths every parent believes" → "Five dyslexia myths" (broader appeal)
- Consider universalizing specific topics
- Direct appeal: "If your kid hates school, please watch this"

### Thumbnail Construction

- Stock photos often work better than illustrations
- Show the most extreme version of the title
- Expressive headshots with paraphrased quotes
- Less text, higher contrast
- "Dial it to 11" - what's the most shocking visual?

### Complementarity

Title and thumbnail should work together, not repeat:
- Title: "6 months with Ray-Ban Smart Glasses"
- Thumbnail: "It has one problem" (creates intrigue)

---

## UGC & Collaboration Strategy

### Gathering UGC

- Ask for specific content: "Your best homeschool tip in 30 seconds"
- Get legal releases ("by submitting, you agree to...")
- Internal company Slack can be source of footage
- Show example of what you want before asking

### Collaboration Boost

- Listing collaborators on Instagram posts = instant boost
- Expert contributors to newsletter/podcast can share to their audience
- "Press junket" mentality - piggyback on movie releases, book launches

---

## What NOT to Do

### Don't Build Process Before Proof

"You don't build processes that support the creation of a product that no one wants."

### Don't Clickbait

Clickbait = "You tripped the audience into something"
- Acceptable: Start with punchline, deliver on premise
- Not acceptable: Promise something you don't deliver

### Don't Over-Invest in Non-Performers

- Skip weak clips entirely
- Don't polish turds
- But DO test multiple title/thumbnail versions on good content

### Don't Predict KPIs

"I'm not a fortune teller... asymmetric growth over the course of a year."
- Just focus on: Am I trending up or down this month?
- Show up every day, that's 80% of the battle

## Quotes Worth Remembering

> "What is special and cool about you? And then... is that something you say? Is that something that you show?"

> "The problem is that first 2 or 3 second hook... you don't have to solve it. The podcast community basically doesn't solve it."

> "It's very difficult to build process when you haven't figured out what really works."

> "I would encourage any creator to be like, try to allow yourself to be broader. Otherwise you're gonna have an upper limit."

> "I don't have bad clips, I publish everything."

---

## Skill Application Summary

These insights should flow into:

1. **short-form-video skill**: Hook construction, Triple Word Score, production methodology, platform specs
2. **video-caption-creation skill**: Already has hook categories - add McDonald's Test, dialing to 11
3. **podcast-production skill**: Clip selection criteria, title/thumbnail complementarity
4. **social-content-creation skill**: Tips format, multiple pillars, polarizing statements
