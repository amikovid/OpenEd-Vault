## Best Clip: "The Homeschool Girl Who Dominated Military Training"

**Type:** Edited (1 cut)
**Total Length:** ~57 seconds

### Edit Sheet

| Timestamp | Speaker | Content |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **6:47 - 7:04** | Donahue | OBJECTION: "If you allow a child to refuse to tolerate the inconvenience of taking a nap when all the rest take a nap, or take a cookie when all the others in kindergarten take a cookie - what you get sooner or later is a very spoiled child" |
| **[CUT]** | | _Skip parent's defense (~35 sec)_ |
| **7:39 - 8:19** | Holt | RESPONSE: "Phil, I know a homeschooling family in Connecticut whose oldest daughter has been out of school for many years. This summer she got an NRC scholarship to college and part of the deal was she had to take basic infantry training - on your belly in the mud, fire the guns, the whole bit. Now here's that real life you folks are all talking about. This girl did brilliantly - she got medals in marksmanship, grenade throwing, she was such an outstanding cadet they've taken her on a special trip to Germany. That's about as real as real life can get, isn't it? So that worry just doesn't work out in practice." |

### Why This Works

- **Hook:** Donahue voices the mainstream fear (spoiled children who can't handle real life) - creates immediate tension
- **Arc:** Objection → [cut] → Devastating counter-example with concrete details
- **Coda:** "That's about as real as real life can get" - lands the argument with a memorable line

### Suggested On-Screen Text

1. "What happened when a homeschooled girl took military training"
2. "He thought homeschooled kids couldn't handle real life"
3. "This 1981 clip aged perfectly"
4. "The audience wasn't ready for his response"

## Alternate Clips

### Runner-Up: "Schools Destroy Character" (Opening Statement)

**Type:** Continuous
**Length:** ~50 seconds

| Timestamp | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| **0:09 - 1:00** | Opening graphic + audience reaction: "Schools are not only destructive of intellect but character. With very few exceptions the social life of our schools is mean spirited, competitive, status seeking, snobbish, cruel, often violent..." |

**Why:** Provocative opener that still resonates. But less of a story arc - more of a thesis statement.

### Runner-Up: "No Evidence Certified Teachers Teach Better"

**Type:** Continuous
**Length:** ~45 seconds

| Timestamp | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| **~20:00 - 20:45** | "In four states now the courts have challenged the state educational authorities to produce any evidence that certified teachers could teach better than non-certified. And in four states they were not able to produce any such evidence. There isn't any such evidence. It's a myth." |

**Why:** Strong data-driven claim. But less emotionally compelling than the military training story.
