### LinkedIn
In 1981, Phil Donahue voiced what many parents still fear: "If you don't make kids conform to schedules and routines, you'll raise spoiled children who can't handle the real world."

John Holt's response is still the best counter-argument I've ever heard.

A homeschooled girl from Connecticut won an ROTC scholarship. Part of the deal? Basic infantry training. "On your belly in the mud, fire the guns."

She didn't just pass. She earned medals in marksmanship and grenade throwing. The Army sent her on a special trip to Germany.

"That's about as real as real life can get."

43 years later, the "socialization" myth persists. The evidence doesn't.

## Notes

**Why this clip works:**
1. **Objection-Response structure** creates natural tension
2. **Specific details** (Connecticut, NRC scholarship, Germany) make it credible
3. **Multiple beats** (scholarship → training → medals → Germany trip) build momentum
4. **Perfect coda** ("That's about as real as real life can get") lands the argument

**Historical context for LinkedIn/long-form:**
- John Holt (1923-1985) was the father of the modern homeschooling movement
- Author of "How Children Fail" (1964) and "How Children Learn" (1967)
- Coined the term "unschooling"
- This appearance was during peak controversy about homeschool legality
