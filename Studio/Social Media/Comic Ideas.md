Single Panel comic

Bogart Creek - Derek Evernden
dry, cerebral single panel gags on social issues."

"As it turned out, the jokes that cracked me up were a lot more dark and absurd than The New Yorker seems to prefer (perhaps excluding the awesome work of Edward Steed), and I gravitated to that. I’ve been seeing how far I can push it ever since. I’ve got some basic rules I try to follow: no swearing, no sexual humor (except for the odd reindeer in drag), I try and avoid puns and overtly ‘relatable’ stuff, and no political gags. Beyond that, sky’s the limit with these dark comics. I’ve been really amazed at how much people of all ages and lifestyles seem to be OK with really dark, violent, and twisted sense of humor."

"Visually I aspire to Jim Unger and Bill Watterson’s brush and ink work (although more and more I lean on a tablet instead of traditional media), the latter is probably most obvious whenever I draw a dinosaur or space ship, but of course The Far Side is the gold standard for single panel humour. I desperately try to avoid mining the same material, but there are neurons deep in my brain that are so imprinted it’s inevitable that they influence me now and then - I count on the sharp hive mind of Imgur to call BS on me if that ever happens, and so far I’ve been pretty lucky. I imagine it would be like an animated cartoon writer who grew up on the Simpsons trying to get out from under that shadow. It’s a bloody long walk!"

"Most of my humor is based on the fear of the sky falling, compounded by looking stupid as it happens. Other topics include: the underdog’s revenge; windows into the minds of outliers and weirdos; the corruption or perversion of pop cultural icons; laughing (or trying to laugh) in the face of life’s utter cruelty; humanity’s complicated relationship with non-humans; the silliness of machismo; the ugliness of avarice."

I like the idea of having everything in that one frame - a pivotal moment in a movie that’s in the viewer’s imagination. It’s a fascinating challenge finding just the right amount of information to put in or leave out in order to get the proper rhythm leading up to that ‘aha’ moment when you (hopefully) get a laugh. If you hold the reader’s hand, you get a ‘groan’, and if you’re too vague, you ruin the joke with confusion. I’m always amazed when it works."

3. "The Upgrade"
A child sits in a doctor's office. The doctor holds up an X-ray showing a heart, imagination clouds, and wonder. Doctor to parents: "Good news - we can remove all of this before kindergarten."

10. "Commencement"
Graduation ceremony, but the graduates are marching directly off the stage into a giant meat grinder. The banner reads "CONGRATULATIONS - YOU'RE READY!" Parents in the audience are weeping with pride, not horror.

6. "The Aquarium"
A family of fish stands outside a glass tank, tapping on it, watching a human inside at a desk doing paperwork. Little fish to parent: "Why does it just sit there?" Parent fish: "They do that for 40 years, then they die."

19. "The Zoo"
Aliens visiting a "HUMAN ZOO" exhibit. One enclosure labeled "MIDDLE MANAGEMENT" shows a human sending emails to himself. Adjacent enclosure "INFLUENCER" shows one taking selfies of the wall. Alien child: "They seem sad." Alien parent: "They were sad before we got here."

5. "Ed's Real Grades"
Ed holds two report cards. Official one: "A+ in COMPLIANCE, A+ in SITTING STILL, A+ in NOT ASKING QUESTIONS." Hidden one (crumpled, in his other hoof): "F in CURIOSITY, F in WONDER, F in WILL TO LIVE." Teacher beaming: "Your parents will be so proud!"

6. "Ed Plays the Game"
