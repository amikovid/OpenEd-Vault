### TWEET 1 (OPENER + IMAGE)

A DC school just dropped books from 8th grade. A neuroscientist accidentally made the case for homeschooling. And 872 parents on Reddit are fighting about what counts as "enough."

Five education stories worth your time:

### TWEET 2 - DC DROPS BOOKS

The richest public middle school in DC told parents their 8th graders won't read full-length books anymore. Short passages "better prepare them for high school."

Meanwhile a dad and his 15-year-old almost quit David Copperfield 600 pages in. They finished. They got it.

### TWEET 3 - SLEEP

New NHERI research roundup on homeschooled vs. conventional students. The headline stats are predictable (higher ACT, lower depression). The interesting part is why.

Homeschooled kids get 4 extra hours of sleep per week.

Maybe the pedagogy debate is a distraction and we should just let teenagers sleep.

### TWEET 4 - CREATIVE WRITING

A Stanford freshman from Alpha School published a creative writing guide that includes "Creative Insults Only" day - you can only complain using metaphors.

"That math homework is a black hole sucking away my will to live."

He also wrote an ode to his scuba gear for a poetry class. h/t @austinscholar

### TWEET 5 - MEMORY

BU neuroscientist published a book on how memory is fluid and shaped by emotion. He wasn't writing about education. But the implication is obvious.

A kid who associates learning with anxiety is literally wiring that in. @BraveWriter made a related point - handwriting lights up more brain areas than typing. No autocomplete. Just a hand and a mind.

### TWEET 6 - REDDIT

872 homeschool parents just had the fight that school boards can't.

"You don't homeschool enough." One parent ranting about co-op families who barely do 30 min/day. The replies are the real story - PreK parents saying 10 min is fine, others calling out families whose high schoolers can't read.

Self-governance is messy. It's also working.

### TWEET 7 (CLOSER)

The through line on all of these: @michaelbhorn put it best in his foreword to a new book on virtual schools -

"Lockstep learning for all simply cannot accommodate individuality."

## NOTES

- v2: Shorter, tighter, each tweet links to source article
- Opener teases 3 specific things instead of generic "5 stories" frame
- Horn tagged in closer with direct link to his piece
- Brave Writer woven into memory tweet (too light alone)
- Each tweet stands alone if someone drops in mid-thread
- No emojis, no correlatives, no staccato fragments, no setup phrases
- Dropped: Groundhog Day (stale), EdChoice (failed scrape), Horn AI math (too long), printer (low value), online options (removed post)
