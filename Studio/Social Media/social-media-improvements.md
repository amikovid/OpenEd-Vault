## Current Gaps

There's a lot of things we could be doing better from a social media perspective:

### 1. Strategic Comments
Make more strategic use of comments - engage, don't just post.

### 2. Repurposing Workflow
Need someone really on top of repurposing clips for social media with optimized captions for all platforms:
- **Instagram/TikTok:** All about the hook
- **Facebook:** Can get more intimate with families in the program

### 3. Podcast Links
Make sure we have links in the comments to the podcast - since we're not able to link directly, use comments for redirection.

### 4. Newsletter Screenshots
For a lot of posts, we could post screenshots of the newsletter, then:
- Automatically post a comment like "Get more of these from the newsletter"
- Trigger if it gets a certain amount of traction

### 5. Cross-Platform Repurposing
We could be:
- Repurposing newsletters onto LinkedIn and X as newsletters
- Creating tweet threads with summaries of every daily newsletter
