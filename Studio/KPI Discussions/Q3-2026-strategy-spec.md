# Q3 2026 Strategy & Compensation Spec

**Purpose:** Framework for CMO conversation on Q3 goals, metrics, and variable pay.
**Created:** 2026-01-20

---

## The Core Thesis

All content efforts should funnel to **subscriber acquisition**. Social metrics have value (reach, brand awareness, influencer relationships) but the ultimate measure of success is: did we grow the email list?

This aligns with the "Raise the Bar" initiative: inspect what we expect, use data to drive strategy, bring solutions with supporting analysis.

## Current State

### Q2 Performance
| Metric | Weighted Goal | Weighted Actual | Performance |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Overall | 2,145 | 2,198 | **102%** |

**Key insight:** Crushed high-weight channels (Newsletter 118%, YouTube 175%), underperformed low-weight social channels. The weighting system correctly prioritized what matters.

### Q3 Proposed Goals (CMO)
- Weighted goal: 2,841 (29% growth from Q2)
- Same weighting structure as Q2

### Current Variable Compensation
- $10,000/year ($5,000 paid twice yearly)
- Tied to hitting weighted audience growth targets

---

## Strategic Bets for Q3

### 1. Curricula Lead Magnet
**Status:** MVP functional, between proof-of-concept and scale
**Why it matters:** Every user gives email = automatic lead capture
**Q3 goal:** Validate the flywheel before scaling

**Success signals:**
- Signups/week trend
- Email capture → nurture → enrollment attribution
- Influencer/provider partnership interest

**Next actions:**
- UI polish pass
- Build shareable image generation (Nano Banana templates)
- Outreach template for curriculum providers
- Track in HubSpot as lead source

### 2. SEO-to-Subscriber Pipeline
**Status:** Own the blog end-to-end, traffic growing
**Why it matters:** Organic traffic is the most scalable acquisition channel
**Q3 goal:** Connect SEO traffic → subscriber conversion → prove attribution

**Success signals:**
- Organic traffic growth (GA4)
- Blog → newsletter signup rate
- Traffic → lead → enrollment attribution (HubSpot)

**Next actions:**
- Audit current tracking setup (GA4, Webflow, HubSpot)
- Request any missing HubSpot permissions from Ops
- Instrument subscriber attribution by source
- Select Q3 SEO content priorities from existing briefs

### 3. Platform-Specific Content Flywheels
**Philosophy:** Low-friction, replicable formats that leverage archive + AI without becoming slop.

| Platform | Audience | Q3 Play |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **X/Twitter** | Intellectual homeschool parents | Evergreen resurfacing engine - tag featured guests, link to archive |
| **YouTube** | Search-driven discovery | SEO research → resurface long-form podcast clips matching queries |
| **Facebook** | Mainstream moms | Ad-heavy play, curricula promotion |
| **Instagram** | Aesthetic homeschool moms | Faceless content, Pinterest-ready visuals |

**Shared infrastructure needed:**
- Rolodex of featured people (name, platforms, handles)
- Content Index linkage for resurfacing
- Platform-specific posting templates

### 4. Attribution Infrastructure
**Status:** HubSpot access exists, attribution not yet built
**Why it matters:** This is the pay raise argument. "I grew the primary lead channel X%, which contributed Y enrollments at $Z LTV."

**Q3 goal:** Build the full funnel view: Channel → Subscriber → Lead → Enrollment → Revenue

**Next actions:**
- Map current HubSpot lead stages
- Ensure subscriber source tracking is clean
- Build/request enrollment attribution report
- Create monthly attribution dashboard

## Proposed KPI Framework

### Option A: Accept Weighted Goals + Add Stretch Tier
Keep CMO's weighted framework (2,841 weighted goal) as baseline.
Add a stretch tier for exceptional performance with higher bonus.

| Tier | Weighted Performance | Variable Payout |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Baseline | 100% of 2,841 | $5,000 |
| Strong | 115% of 2,841 | $7,500 |
| Exceptional | 130% of 2,841 | $10,000 |

**Pros:** Low friction, uses existing framework, CMO already bought in
**Cons:** Doesn't simplify to "subs matter most"

### Option B: Hybrid - Weighted Base + Raw Subscriber Stretch
Weighted goals for baseline payout.
Separate stretch bonus tied purely to raw subscriber growth.

| Component | Goal | Payout |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Weighted baseline | 2,841 | $5,000 |
| Subscriber stretch (3,000) | 3,000 raw subs | +$2,500 |
| Subscriber moon shot (5,000) | 5,000 raw subs | +$5,000 |

**Pros:** Aligns incentives with the "all roads → subs" thesis
**Cons:** More complex, requires buy-in on the philosophy

### Option C: Propose New Metrics Entirely
Replace current framework with:
1. **Newsletter subscribers** (primary) - 50% weight
2. **Organic traffic growth** - 20% weight
3. **Curricula signups** - 15% weight
4. **Attribution score** (leads with clear channel source) - 15% weight

**Pros:** Measures what actually matters
**Cons:** Requires more negotiation, CMO may want continuity

### Recommended Approach: Option B (Hybrid)

**Rationale:**
- Respects CMO's framework (she proposed it, don't fight the framing)
- Adds clarity that subs are the north star
- Creates asymmetric upside if you crush it
- Easy to explain: "I'll hit your weighted goals AND grow subs faster"

## Compensation Ask

### Current
- Base salary: [not discussed]
- Variable: $10,000/year ($5,000/half)

### Proposed
- Variable: $20,000/year ($10,000/half)
- Structure: Base payout + stretch tiers (see Option B above)

### Justification
1. **Results:** Q2 weighted performance at 102% of goal
2. **Expanded scope:** Running content operation (4+ contractors, AI systems)
3. **Strategic infrastructure:** Building attribution, automation, curricula - not just executing content
4. **Leverage:** Delivering 2x output through systems, not hours

### Framing for Conversation
Don't lead with the money. Lead with:
1. "Here's my Q3 strategy and why it aligns with Raise the Bar"
2. "Here are the metrics I want to be held to"
3. "Given this scope and these goals, here's the variable structure I'm proposing"

---

## CMO Conversation Agenda

1. **Validate Q2 performance** - "We hit 102% weighted. Newsletter and YouTube carried us."

2. **Present Q3 strategy** - "I want to make everything flow to subs. Here's how: SEO pipeline, curricula lead magnet, platform flywheels."

3. **Propose metrics refinement** - "I accept your 2,841 weighted goal as baseline. I want to add a subscriber stretch tier."

4. **Discuss attribution build** - "I'm going to build the funnel attribution this quarter. By Q4, I'll be able to show channel → revenue."

5. **Align on variable structure** - "Given the expanded scope and strategy, I'm proposing $10k/half with stretch tiers."

## Notes from Interview

**On curricula:** "Almost like a new social media platform for homeschool moms" - but not ready to pitch that yet. Q3 is about proving the concept before scaling.

**On X/Twitter:** Grew from 240 to 350 followers in a week from one big retweet. The intellectual homeschool audience is there and underserved. Build the evergreen resurfacing engine.

**On automation:** "We're trying to be the most human while at the same time actually leveraging a lot of AI. We're not going to do AI slop but we are probably going to do a lot of faceless Instagram content."

**On hours:** Working ~20 hours/week through leverage (contractors, AI, systems). This is a feature, not a bug - it's about output, not input.

**On the core ask:** Strategic alignment first. Money follows from shared understanding of the strategy and metrics.
