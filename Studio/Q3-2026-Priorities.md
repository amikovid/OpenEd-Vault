# OpenEd Q3 2026 Priorities (Jan-March)

*Refined from brainstorm, January 1, 2026*

---

## The Strategic Frame

**Core insight:** AI tooling (Claude Code + context engineering) has 10x'd my shipping capacity. The question is how to convert that into measurable business value that justifies increased compensation.

**The approach:** Don't ask for more money tied to more availability. Instead: keep current structure, but propose 2-3x bonus potential tied to ambitious outcomes they'd be happy to pay for.

---

## Compensation Proposal

### Current State
- Salary: [current]
- Bonus potential: $10K
- Subscriber base: ~20K (mostly from program applicants, not organic)

### Proposed
- Salary: unchanged
- Bonus potential: $20-30K
- Tied to: measurable subscriber growth + content output

### Hybrid KPI Structure

| Metric | Weight | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Newsletter subscribers (organic) | 40% | +X from baseline | Outcome metric, what they care about |
| SEO articles published | 30% | 60 articles | Output metric, 100% in my control |
| Guest contributor pieces | 15% | 5+ published | Network building, nearbound strategy |
| Tools Directory launched | 15% | 20+ reviews | New content format, SEO play |

**Why hybrid:** Pure outcome metrics have attribution problems. Pure output metrics feel like busywork. Hybrid means I'm accountable for shipping AND results.
