<p><em>Reviewed by Rachael Davie, OpenEd Teacher & Former High School Math Teacher</em></p>

<p>When parents tell me their child "just doesn't get math," Math-U-See is usually my first recommendation. I've spent years matching families with curricula, and I keep coming back to this one for kinesthetic learners and students who've struggled with traditional approaches.</p>

<p>The manipulatives are the heart of this curriculum. Colored blocks that students physically move around to understand place value, multiplication, fractions. My colleague Keely describes them as "key to the method" - and she's right. The calm video lessons from Steve Demme break concepts into five-minute chunks that don't overwhelm.</p>

<p>As Kirsten on our team puts it: "It's book-based and you can purchase video lessons that go with each lesson." That flexibility matters. Some families use only the workbooks and manipulatives. Others lean heavily on the videos. Both approaches work.</p>

<p>I especially recommend Math-U-See for students struggling with abstract concepts. The physical representation makes ideas concrete in a way that paper-based curricula can't match. But I'm honest with families: it requires parent involvement, especially in the early levels. You'll be sitting with your child, guiding their hands on those blocks.</p>

<h3>Quick Verdict</h3>

<p>Hands-on, mastery-based math curriculum using physical manipulatives. Works exceptionally well for kinesthetic learners, students with math anxiety, and kids who've struggled with other programs. Higher upfront cost ($150-200 to start), but materials are reusable across multiple children.</p>

<h3>Best For</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kinesthetic learners who need to touch and move objects to understand</li>
<li>Students who've struggled with other math programs</li>
<li>Visual learners who benefit from colored block representations</li>
<li>Kids with ADHD or learning differences - the single-topic focus reduces overwhelm</li>
<li>Families with multiple children - manipulatives and instruction packs are reusable</li>
<li>Parents who want video support for teaching</li>
</ul>

<h3>May Not Fit</h3>

<ul>
<li>Advanced students who need more challenge and problem-solving depth</li>
<li>Kids who crave variety - mastery approach means extended time on one concept</li>
<li>Very tight budgets - upfront cost for manipulatives adds up</li>
<li>Families wanting full independence - younger levels require parent supervision</li>
</ul>

## WHAT PARENTS SAY (Toggle 2)

**CMS Field:** `teaching-format-content`
**Note:** External voices only - homeschool community blogs/forums

```html
<p>Beyond what we see at OpenEd, the broader homeschool community reports similar experiences. Parents of struggling learners consistently describe Math-U-See as a turning point:</p>

<blockquote>"I switched to Math U See when my 3rd grader was counting everything and struggling... she is now solid on her facts."<br>— <a href="https://www.design-your-homeschool.com/think-hard-about-mathusee.html">Design Your Homeschool</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Math-U-See is a good fit [for my son with ADHD]. The single subject focus is very helpful for him... This approach also keeps the daily time required down, which is ideal."<br>— <a href="https://jeather.wordpress.com/reviews/math-resources/math-u-see-early-review/">Stumbling Homeschool Mom</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"I see both of my children gaining joy, skills, and confidence in math!"<br>— <a href="https://treehouseschoolhouse.com/blog/our-math-journey-honest-reviews-of-the-good-and-the-beautiful-masterbooks-and-math-u-see-curriculum">Treehouse Schoolhouse</a></blockquote>

<p>The ADHD connection comes up frequently. Parents report that the single-topic focus and hands-on approach work well for kids who get overwhelmed by spiral curricula that jump between concepts.</p>

<p>The most common critique? Cost. Parents acknowledge the upfront investment is real, but many argue the manipulatives pay for themselves - especially for families with multiple children, since the blocks are reusable indefinitely.</p>

## HOW IT WORKS (Toggle 3)

**CMS Field:** `pricing-content`

```html
<h3>What It Covers</h3>

<p>Complete K-12 mathematics program. Starts with fundamental arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), moves through intermediate topics (fractions, decimals, percentages), and extends through high school math (algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, calculus).</p>

<p>Uses Greek letter level names (Primer, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.) instead of grade levels. Students start wherever their skills are - Math-U-See offers a free placement test.</p>

<p>Optional "Stewardship" course available for personal finance with biblical principles. The main curriculum is secular.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<p><strong>Instruction Pack:</strong> Teacher's manual and video lessons (DVD or streaming). Steve Demme teaches each lesson in calm, five-minute segments.</p>

<p><strong>Student Pack:</strong> Workbook and test booklet. Consumable - you'll need one per student.</p>

<p><strong>Manipulatives:</strong> Colored block sets (Integer Block Kit for elementary, Fraction Overlays and Algebra/Decimal inserts for upper levels). These are reusable across children.</p>

<h3>Lesson Flow</h3>

<p>Each lesson follows a consistent structure: Watch Steve Demme's video demonstration → practice with manipulatives → complete worksheets and cumulative review. The mastery approach means students don't move forward until they truly understand the current concept.</p>

<p>Parents can skip unnecessary practice pages once mastery is demonstrated. No need to complete every problem if your child already gets it.</p>

<h3>Parent Involvement</h3>

<p>Moderate involvement required. You'll preview the video lessons (or watch alongside your child), facilitate hands-on work with manipulatives, and check completed work. Plan for 10-15 minutes of prep per lesson.</p>

<p>The videos do the heavy lifting on instruction. As kids mature, many middle schoolers work through lessons more independently - watching videos and completing work with minimal supervision.</p>

## PRICING (Toggle 4)

**CMS Field:** `parent-involvement`

```html
<p>Math-U-See is a one-time purchase per level (no subscription).</p>

<p><strong>Instruction Pack:</strong> $70-$90 per level (teacher's manual + video lessons)</p>

<p><strong>Student Pack:</strong> ~$30 per student per level (workbook + tests)</p>

<p><strong>Integer Block Kit:</strong> ~$80 one-time (used from Primer through Delta - covers elementary years)</p>

<p><strong>Add-ons for upper levels:</strong> Fraction Overlays (~$50), Algebra/Decimal inserts (~$25)</p>

<h3>Cost-Saving Tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>Manipulatives and instruction packs are reusable - only buy consumable student workbooks for additional children</li>
<li>Check homeschool resale groups for used manipulatives and older edition DVDs</li>
<li>Use the free placement test - don't buy a level your child has already mastered</li>
<li>Compare to tutoring: Many families find Math-U-See cheaper than hiring a math tutor ($40-60/session vs. ~$120/year for the full program)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Higher upfront investment than some curricula, but the reusability and included video instruction make it cost-effective for families with multiple children or those who would otherwise need tutoring support.</p>

## FAQs & ALTERNATIVES (Toggle 5 or final block)

**CMS Field:** `parent-feedback-content`

```html
<h3>FAQs & Alternatives</h3>

<p><strong>Is Math-U-See worth it?</strong><br>
For the right student, yes. If your child is a kinesthetic learner, has struggled with other programs, or you want video instruction support, Math-U-See delivers. The upfront cost pays off when it clicks.</p>

<p><strong>What ages/grades?</strong><br>
Pre-K through Calculus. Uses Greek letter level names instead of grades - use the free placement test to find the right starting point.</p>

<p><strong>Secular or religious?</strong><br>
Mostly secular. The main math curriculum is neutral. There's an optional "Stewardship" personal finance course with biblical principles, but you can skip it.</p>

<p><strong>Can my child work independently?</strong><br>
Depends on age. K-3 students need significant parent involvement. By middle school, many students watch videos and complete work independently with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><strong>How does it compare to Saxon?</strong><br>
Different philosophies. Math-U-See is mastery-based (one topic until solid), Saxon is spiral (constant review of multiple topics). Saxon is more rigorous but can feel relentless. Math-U-See is gentler but potentially slower.</p>

<h3>Alternatives to Consider</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="/tools/saxon-math"><strong>Saxon Math</strong></a> — Spiral approach with constant review. More rigorous, can feel dry. Pair with Nicole the Math Lady for video instruction.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/beast-academy-online"><strong>Beast Academy</strong></a> — Comic-book style for advanced learners who want challenge and depth. Not for struggling students.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/teaching-textbooks"><strong>Teaching Textbooks</strong></a> — Video-based and self-paced with less parent involvement. Less rigorous but great for independent learners.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/singapore-math"><strong>Singapore Math</strong></a> — Rigorous and conceptual. Requires strong parent teaching ability, no video support.</li>
<li><a href="/tools/khan-academy"><strong>Khan Academy</strong></a> — Free, self-paced, mastery-based. Less structured than Math-U-See, but a good supplement or budget alternative.</li>
</ul>
