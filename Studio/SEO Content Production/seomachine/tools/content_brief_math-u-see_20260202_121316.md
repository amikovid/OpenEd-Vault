Potential missing angles (related keywords not reflected in competitor headings):

- math u see _(vol: 14,800)_
- math u see levels _(vol: 1,600)_
- math u see placement test _(vol: 590)_
- math u see login _(vol: 480)_

Other practical differentiators to consider:

- Add a clear definition + quick summary at top (snippet-friendly).
- Include a worked example, template, or checklist readers can copy.
- Address common misconceptions and edge cases competitors skip.
- Add an FAQ section mapped directly to People Also Ask-style questions.

## Notes / Limitations

- Competitor scraping is best-effort and may miss headings on JS-heavy sites.
- Metrics come from DataForSEO and may vary by location/device.
