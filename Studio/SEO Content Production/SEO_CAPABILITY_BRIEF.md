# SEO Capability Brief

**Date:** January 30, 2026

## The Foundation We Built

Fred helped us develop the keyword strategy and content architecture over the past year. That work gave us:

- A hub-and-spoke model organized around pedagogies, curriculum, and state guides
- 18 priority keywords mapped to business goals
- Content templates and quality standards
- Integration with DataForSEO, Google Analytics, and Search Console

That foundation is solid. What's changed is that I now have direct access to the tools and can see exactly what's happening with our content.

## What I Can See in the Dashboard

### Keywords Close to Page 1

These are sitting at positions 11-20. Small optimizations could push them into the top 10:

| Keyword | Position | Impressions/mo | Clicks |
|---------|----------|----------------|--------|
| marilyn vos savant | #11.5 | 1,014 | 22 |
| john taylor gatto | #11.6 | 935 | 10 |
| free homeschool resources | #14.6 | 747 | 8 |
| free homeschool curriculum | #11.6 | 606 | 8 |
| open education | #11.3 | 546 | 16 |
| lexia | #17.3 | 363 | 1 |
| john gatto | #11.0 | 343 | 3 |
| typing.com | #11.7 | 334 | 2 |
| best homeschool math curriculum | #17.0 | 318 | 2 |
| free homeschool curriculum by mail | #11.1 | 200 | 1 |

The Gatto and Marilyn vos Savant articles are our best opportunities - high impressions, decent clicks, just need a push.

### Content That's Declining

These articles lost significant traffic and need refreshes:

| Article | Before | After | Change |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Best Homeschool Science Curriculum | 391 | 36 | -91% |
| Child Struggling to Read | 162 | 14 | -91% |
| How to Homeschool Year-Round | 94 | 9 | -90% |
| Every August Youth Mental Health | 153 | 18 | -88% |
| Homeschooling a Child with ADHD | 266 | 32 | -88% |
| Why Your ADHD Kid Won't Listen | 86 | 10 | -88% |
| What Happens When a Teacher Tells Teens | 55 | 7 | -87% |
| Homeschool Gift Guide 2025 | 1,025 | 89 | -91% (seasonal) |

The gift guide decline is expected after the holidays. The others are content issues - competitors have fresher material.

### Where We're Not Ranking Yet

Of our 18 priority keywords, only 3 are ranking:

| Status | Keywords |
|--------|----------|
| Ranking (page 2) | free homeschool curriculum, homeschool programs, accredited homeschool programs |
| Not ranking | montessori, homeschool, homeschool curriculum, virtual school, classical education, charlotte mason, waldorf education, kindergarten curriculum, state guides |

The big-volume keywords (montessori at 63k searches, homeschool curriculum at 15k) need dedicated hub content to break through.

### Competitor Gaps

Running gap analysis against Cathy Duffy, HSLDA, Harmony, and Braintree surfaced 423 keywords they rank for that we don't. The biggest opportunities:

| Keyword | Monthly Searches | Difficulty |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| homeschool resources | 301,000 | Low |
| reflex math | 135,000 | Very low |
| time4learning | 135,000 | Low |
| mystery science | 90,500 | Very low |
| reading eggs | 74,000 | Low |
| math is fun | 49,500 | Very low |
| power homeschool | 33,100 | Low |

Most of these are tool/curriculum reviews - exactly the kind of content our tools directory can support.

## Where I Want to Focus Next

**February priorities:**
- Push Gatto article from #11 to page 1 (quick win, already has momentum)
- Refresh the Science Curriculum article (was getting 391 views, now 36)
- Publish the Mastery-Based Learning deep dive
- Create Nevada state page (Melissa flagged this as high-growth market)

**March priorities:**
- Indiana state page (address Braintree brand confusion)
- ADHD article refresh (was 266 views, dropped to 32)
- Peter Gray thinker profile
- Start tool reviews for high-volume gaps (Reflex Math, Time4Learning)

**Ongoing:**
- Weekly check on declining content
- Monthly competitor gap analysis
- Continue thinker series for broader audience appeal

## Recommendation

Fred's work gave us the strategy and infrastructure. I now have the tools to execute it - I can see what's working, what's declining, and where the gaps are.

For keyword research and content planning, we can handle this internally going forward.
