# **“What ‘Against The Grade’ Means To Me”**

## **by Mason Ember**

When I reflect on the [documentary](https://againstthegrade.com) I spent the past two years directing, I often have doubts about making the subject of my first feature film “homeschooling.”

As a 16-year-old homeschooler myself, some of that doubt comes from seeing the relentless criticism of this style of education from people and sources I revere. When the New York Times and other bastions of what I consider the intellectual and cultural "gold-standard" [sweepingly dismiss homeschooling](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html), you can only "agree to disagree" so many times before questioning your parents’ choices.

But mostly, my reservation about orienting the first statement of my career around homeschooling comes from my own ambivalence towards this lifestyle.

Throughout my life, I have never doubted that homeschooling was right for *me*. Even pre-school was too rigid for the way my mind works. I remember being sat by an art easel in the progressive pre-school I went to (for all of two months) absolutely captivated by finger painting – and then being pulled away from my excitement by the teachers, who required that every child participate in group sing-along time, the kind of activity that, even then, I saw as totally unnecessary.

And yet… while I have always been confident in myself and my parents' continued choice to not send me to school, I have never been fully sold on what I saw in the homeschool community around me. I’ve met incredibly creative, distinct, mature, well-rounded kids who prospered when given the keys to their own education. I’ve *also* met social rejects, extreme procrastinators, and (in very rare cases) kids who have been overly sheltered and denied a full grasp of reality by their parents. I’m certain that many of the kids in this latter group would do better within the requirements of conventional school.

This varied nature of the homeschool community sometimes made it difficult for me to find a cohesive group of reliable friends. As I entered my middle-school years, my parents and I decided that socially, it might be helpful to find classes and activities where I would meet and learn alongside kids from public and private schools.

I joined after-school theatre programs and an after school debate team, where I made the first real friends I ever had outside the homeschool sphere. It was a nice new perspective, and I was more than willing to endure a few weeks of questioning (“How do you *learn* anything? Do you wear pajamas all day? Are your parents crazy religious or something? etc.”) before people got to know me as “one of the good” homeschoolers.

Then, in November 2022, something changed: ChatGPT went live, and it suddenly became apparent to me just how many of my new classmates were willing – when all that mattered was getting a grade, or winning a debate tournament – to totally outsource their thoughts, opinions, and words to a machine that did things quicker than them. And I get why; the system of school isn’t conducive to wanting to “do things.” In school (in what some would argue is preparation for a capitalist, post-industrial revolution world) your success is determined by how quickly you can get the answer to something, and by how well you can follow commands.

This was an extremely disappointing realization. If I had to chalk up one trait that I always wanted in my friends, it was that they be “doers.” People who created things, like me\! People who had thoughtful arguments, told their own stories, and tried to solve problems, like I always aspired to do.

It seemed that the only reason many of the traditional students around me were doing *anything* was so they got good grades, and now the magic genie of AI gave them another way to “win” the game of school. Simultaneously, other new tech platforms like TikTok made *consumption* a more instantly gratifying pastime than creation. Suddenly I wasn’t sure if there was *any* one lifestyle or approach to education that would consistently nurture a young person’s natural curiosity and desire to do things. 

This frustration made me realize that there was *something* about my upbringing outside of the school system that made my intake of the “doomscroll” and usage of AI happen in more balanced ways, without compromising my own creative outputs or critical thinking. This led me to reconsider building connections with the homeschool community.

(Oh, side note: I really don’t want to be seen as the guy hating on my peers in school and universally dismissing things like AI and social media, as if I’ve reached some kind of enlightenment that they haven’t. That pretentious jerk should note that Mason Ember *is* on Instagram and TikTok, and has certainly used AI to help write a few emails.)

In my ideal vision of homeschooling, young people are given the ability to let their natural curiosity and interests shape their education. My two biggest interests were always politics (hence debate, and the advocacy work I do now) and film, which I explored by making dozens of YouTube experiments throughout my life: cooking shows, short films, science shows, a news show, and even a late-night style talk show called *Mason Ember Weekly*.

At 15, while I was reconnecting socially with the homeschool community, I was also writing several screenplays and decided that I wanted to become a film director. Documentary is a relatively accessible way to prove yourself as a visual storyteller, and if I wanted to direct the screenplays I had written, I figured I needed the prerequisite experience of making something feature-length.

The stars aligned, and I began making "*Against the Grade*," an unprecedented look into the homeschool community in and around New York City through the lives of four distinct homeschooled teenagers. I assembled my film's "cast" by combining the scattered networks of homeschool families we'd clicked with over the years, plus some remarkable kids I'd recently met through homeschool classes and field trips.

In making the film, I was reminded that every homeschooler is different, united only by living outside the system of school, and that there are many different ways to live "against the grade." I now see the homeschool community I immersed myself in as a remarkable alliance of incredibly unique individuals all on different paths. But *some* of those homeschoolers have the same struggles as my friends in school: they also struggle to access their creativity and critical thinking in an era of tools like AI and algorithm-driven content machines like social media.

Is there something homeschool parents need to do differently to prevent this outcome? Or is the reason these struggles affect so many teenagers more than just the issue of school?

As I prepare to finish post-production on *Against the Grade*, I have some anxiety that my first feature film won't represent what I truly want to say about the lifestyle I was raised in; that it won't properly introduce the world to my guiding philosophies. This compels me to say here outright: the film I've made is *not* a story about homeschooling.

It is, in fact, a story about institutions and systems, and the constant battle the four main characters wage to work within them while maintaining their individuality. Institutions can be dangerous things. We need them to exist in the modern world – they are helpful, even powerful tools for change and great artistic output – but they also risk standardizing the population, suppressing creativity and nuance, and getting everybody so used to living inside the institution that they don't think about going anywhere else.

At times throughout the project, I made the mistake of thinking the only institution that mattered for people my age was school, and that simply by avoiding school, we could preserve our creativity and avoid institutionalization and standardization. If this were true, homeschooling would be a very easy answer to many of our problems as a species.

But sadly, nothing is quite that simple. All of us, but especially teenagers, are subject to the outsized influence of institutions. The cliques that form in our social lives through the clubs we join become institutions. The media we consume on TV and via the algorithmic "doomscroll" of social media become an institution. As do the beliefs we hold and the politics we subscribe to. The spread of AI is certainly a fast-growing institution. At their best, institutions like these improve our lives by offering us familiar territory and structures, and by serving us from within. At their worst, they make us think far too mechanically, quickly, and without much creativity and nuance.

The bad news is that homeschooling only protects us from the downsides of one such institution, although it is a big one: standardized mass education. All the rest, we will constantly encounter throughout our highschool years and for the rest of our lives.

I don't believe our goal should be to avoid institutions; that would be impossible. To truly live “against the grade” is not simply to avoid grade school for 18 years, but to always understand where institutions exist in your life, and give yourself the power to choose to live outside of their comforting dominance.

Because institutions *are* comfortable\! It's way easier to exist within them than without them, which is why so many exist. That's also why a core tenet of education itself should be learning how to identify the institutions influencing one’s life, to analyze their effects and impacts, and to learn how to reject or find balance within them.

If we do ever strike that balance with institutions, and truly live “against the grade”, then both those in *and* outside of school will inherit a more creative, thoughtful, and individualistic world.
