## Content Optimization Checklist

### Must Include (High Volume Keywords):
- [x] "CTE" and "career technical education" - defined in article
- [x] "apprenticeship programs" - covered extensively  
- [ ] "vocational training" - ADD more mentions (8,100 volume!)
- [x] "youth apprenticeship" - covered
- [x] "learn a trade" - mentioned

### H2 Optimization Opportunities:
- Current: "What Are Apprenticeships and CTE?"
- Consider: "What Is Vocational Training? (And How It's Changed)"
- Current: "The AI Question: Which Careers Are Actually Safe?"
- Good - unique angle, no keyword but strong hook

### FAQ Section - Add These Questions:
Based on search patterns, add to FAQ:
1. "How do I find apprenticeship programs near me?" ✓ (covered)
2. "What trades pay $100k?" (1,900 volume - NOT in article)

## Recommended Article Updates

### 1. Add "Trades That Pay $100K" Section or FAQ
High-volume query (1,900). Add to FAQ:
> **What trades pay $100K or more?**
> Electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, elevator mechanics, and commercial divers regularly hit six figures. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows median pay for elevator installers at $102K. Welders in specialized fields (underwater, pipeline) often exceed $100K. The key is specialization and geographic flexibility.

### 2. Increase "Vocational Training" Mentions
Currently underused despite 8,100 monthly searches. Add to:
- Intro paragraph
- Definition section (as synonym for CTE)
- Resources section

### 3. Meta Description Update
Current: "Skip the debt, start earning. Learn how apprenticeships and CTE programs help teens build real careers - with practical steps for homeschool families."

Consider adding "vocational training":
"Skip the debt, start earning. Learn how apprenticeships, CTE, and vocational training help teens build real careers - practical steps for homeschool families."
