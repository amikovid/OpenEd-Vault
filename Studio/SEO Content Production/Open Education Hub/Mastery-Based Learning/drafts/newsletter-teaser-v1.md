## THOUGHT

In 1837, Horace Mann sailed to Prussia and came back with an idea that would shape 13,000 hours of every American child's life.

He'd watched the Prussian military turn boys into soldiers through bells, batches, and blind obedience. He thought: what if we did this to all children?

American factory owners loved it. They needed compliant workers. And so a system designed for the Prussian army became the blueprint for American schools. Students graded on a meat-packing scale. Sorted by birth year. Tested at intervals. The wealthy kept their kids out, of course - their children got tutors and museums and horseback riding.

Everyone else got the assembly line.

That was 1837. Two hundred years later, the system is almost identical. Same bells. Same batches. Same A-F scale. The one thing that best predicts a school's test scores is still household income. Not teaching quality. Not curriculum. Zip code.

We made a comedy sketch about this.

## TREND

[VIDEO EMBED]

Two 19th-century bureaucrats in a room, pitching the Prussian model with straight-faced enthusiasm. We filmed it in a real one-room schoolhouse in Utah - and the punishment charts on the walls were funnier than anything we wrote.

The sketch is inspired by Nate Bargatze's George Washington bit on SNL. The history behind it is real. And it raises a question worth sitting with: if the system was designed for obedience, why are we surprised when it fails to produce curiosity?

Here's what the alternative looks like. Competency-based education replaces letter grades with two words: "mastered" or "not yet." Students advance when they're ready, not when the calendar says so. Benjamin Bloom's research showed that mastery learning combined with one-on-one instruction puts the average student ahead of 98% of traditionally taught peers.

LeBron James shoots 50% from the field. By school standards, that's an F. The grading system doesn't measure excellence. It measures compliance.
