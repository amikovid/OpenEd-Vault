In 1837, a man named Horace Mann boarded a ship to Prussia. He was the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education - a new position, for a new idea. Public schooling. He wanted to see how the Prussians did it.

What he found was a machine. Children filed into rooms. Bells rang. They moved. Bells rang again. They sat. They memorized. They obeyed. The Prussian system wasn't built to educate. It was built to produce soldiers. Boys who would march when told, shoot when told, die when told.

Mann loved it.

Not the dying part. The obedience part. The control. The beautiful, scalable efficiency of turning a room full of individual human beings into a single, manageable unit. He sailed home and pitched it to American industrialists, who had their own reasons to love it: factories needed workers who would follow instructions without question.

And so began the system your children still sit inside today.

The grading scale? Borrowed from meat packers - the same A-F system used to sort beef. Students sorted by manufacture date into batches we call "grade levels." Tested at intervals. Labeled. The wealthy, of course, kept their children out. Their kids got tutors, mentors, museums, horseback riding - an education designed to produce leaders. Everyone else got the assembly line.

We made a comedy sketch about this. Two 19th-century bureaucrats in a room, one of them pitching Mann's system to the other with straight-faced enthusiasm. It's a spoof - inspired by Nate Bargatze's George Washington bit on SNL - but the history it's built on is real. And the real story is worse than anything we could write for laughs.

## Who Actually Designed the American School System?

We shot the sketch at the Taylorsville-Bennion Heritage Center in Utah. On the walls, we found artifacts that could have been comedy props but were completely authentic.

A punishment chart. Ten lashes for "Misbehaving to Girls." Ten lashes for "Playing Cards at School." Eight for drinking "spiritous liquors." Eight for "swaring."

Playing cards got more lashes than booze. That tracks - cards implied gambling, and this was back when every soldier received a pint of whiskey as a daily ration.

We posted the casting call and got sixty actor applications within two hours. Filmed the whole thing in four hours. People are ready to laugh at this system. Maybe because deep down, everyone already knows something is broken.

## 13,000 Hours and a Broken Promise

Here's where the comedy ends and the math begins.

A child who goes through K-12 will spend roughly 13,000 hours in the system Mann designed. Two-thirds of teachers are dissatisfied. Parent satisfaction has dropped to a 25-year low. And the one data point that best predicts a school's test scores has nothing to do with what happens in the classroom - it's household income.

We spend $1.7 billion a year on standardized testing. The scores tell us which neighborhoods are wealthy. That's about it.

Since the pandemic, 1.2 million students have left public schools. Homeschooling has grown from 100,000 students in the early 1980s to 3.5 million today. Once parents got a front-row seat to what their kids were actually experiencing, many of them decided they'd seen enough.

## LeBron James Is a Failure

If you think the Prussian grading model at least measures something meaningful, consider this.

LeBron James - the greatest basketball player of his generation. Field goal percentage: 50%. That's an F. Three-point shooting: 35%. Another F. Free throw percentage: 73%. A C- at best.

Roger Federer won 80% of his 1,526 professional tennis matches. Sounds impressive until you realize he only won 54% of the *points* he played. Barely better than a coin flip. By academic standards, that's failing.

Simone Biles has won an Olympic medal in 61% of her events. That's a D-. Gold medals only? 39%. Failing.

The greatest athletes of all time - the ones we celebrate, study, and hold up as examples of human excellence - would be failures by the metrics we use to judge our children.

We've created a system that confuses measurement with meaning. An 89% is fundamentally different from a 90%, and these arbitrary cutoffs follow children through their entire academic careers. A bad week becomes a permanent record. A missed concept becomes a label.

As Federer said in his Dartmouth commencement address: "Perfection is impossible." A champion's mindset doesn't dwell on past failures but commits fully to the next point, the next challenge. Our grading system does exactly the opposite.

## What Is Competency-Based Education?

There's a better way, and it starts with a different question.

Instead of asking "How did you perform on this one attempt?" - competency-based education asks "Have you mastered it yet?"

That three-letter word - *yet* - carries real weight. When we tell kids they're failures, or that they're not proficient enough, we damage their relationship with learning. "Not yet" reframes the whole experience. You're not there yet. And "yet" adds strength to a kid who's struggling, because they know they still have runway.

In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published research that became known as the "Two Sigma Problem." Students who received one-on-one instruction combined with mastery learning techniques performed two standard deviations better than students in conventional classrooms. The average tutored student outperformed 98% of traditionally taught students.

My son Tanner, who holds a doctorate in education, identified three elements at the intersection of real learning:

**Choice** - Some control over how, what, and when they learn. This doesn't mean kids do whatever they want. It means giving them voice and agency appropriate to their developmental level.

**Competency** - Adequate time, resources, and support to actually master skills. No artificial deadlines forcing students forward before they're ready.

**Connection** - Learning linked to topics that matter to them. When students see why something is relevant, engagement follows naturally.

My daughter Eliza told me at 16 that while she enjoyed learning, she found schooling painful because of the stress and anxiety among her peers. After switching to a competency-based program, she completed her associate degree in 14 months. Since then, all five of our children have earned one or more competency-based college degrees.

## The Super Mario Effect

Former NASA engineer Mark Rober ran a fascinating experiment with 50,000 participants attempting a coding puzzle. He split them into two groups. Group 1 lost points for failed attempts - success rate: 27%. Group 2 had no penalties for trying - success rate: 68%.

The second group also made 2.5 times more attempts.

Rober calls this the "Super Mario Effect." In video games, dying isn't a permanent setback. You restart and try again, bringing your new knowledge with you. There's no permanent record of failures - just progress toward the goal.

Traditional grading works like Group 1. Every mistake goes on your record. Mastery-based learning works like Group 2. Failure is just information. You keep trying until you succeed.

## Competency-Based Education vs. Traditional Schooling

Here's what we're really talking about:

| The Old Model | The New Model |
|---|---|
| Time-based: 2 weeks per unit, ready or not | Competency-based: move on when ready |
| Letter grades (A-F) | Mastered or Not Yet |
| Same pace for everyone | Individual pacing |
| Gaps carry forward | Gaps addressed before advancing |
| Failure is permanent | Failure is iteration |
| "What's your grade?" | "What have you mastered?" |

The old model was designed in 1837 for a world of factories and armies. The new model is designed for a world where the most valuable skills - creativity, adaptability, self-direction - are the ones the assembly line was built to suppress.

Companies are already catching on. Google, Apple, IBM, Accenture, Bank of America - they've dropped degree requirements. They don't care about your GPA. They care about what you can actually do.

## What "Open Education" Actually Means

Open education is the recognition that each student is unique and the world is full of possibility.

Rather than being forced to pick between public, private, or homeschool - rather than accepting a system built for obedience or going it alone - open education allows families to take what works from any approach and build something that fits their child.

A student might take science at the local high school for its excellent labs. Learn math through a self-paced platform. Join a homeschool co-op for literature discussions. Develop skills through an apprenticeship or by starting a business.

This isn't anti-public school. It's pro-child. It's the freedom to design learning around the learner.

The two-hundred-year-old trap Mann set is losing its grip. Not because parents are angry - though some of them have every reason to be. It's losing its grip because families are discovering they have choices. And once you see the choices, you don't go back.

## Watch the Sketch

We made this video because laughter is a better weapon than outrage. If you've ever sat in a parent-teacher conference wondering why the system feels like it was designed for someone else's kid - it was. Literally. It was designed for Prussian soldiers.

But your kid isn't a soldier. And education doesn't have to be a factory.

**Primary keyword:** competency-based education
**Secondary keywords:** mastery-based learning, mastery learning, standards-based grading, Horace Mann education, Prussian education model, factory model education
**Long-tail targets:** what is competency-based education, competency-based education vs traditional, who designed the school system, mastery learning at home

**Meta Title:** What Is Competency-Based Education? (And Why School Was Never Designed for Your Kid)

**Meta Description:** In 1837, Horace Mann imported a Prussian military model and called it public school. We made a comedy sketch about it. Here's the real history - and the better alternative.

**URL:** /blog/competency-based-education (or update existing /blog/beyond-a-to-f)

**Content gap being filled:** Nobody connects the Horace Mann / Prussian model history to competency-based education through an entertaining, parent-accessible lens. All existing CBE content is institutional and dry. The comedy sketch hook is a unique angle with no competition.

**Strongest secondary target:** "who invented school" / "who designed the school system" - very high search volume, weak competition, and this article answers the question directly.
