# What Is Competency-Based Education? Why School Was Never Designed for Your Kid

*By Matt Bowman*

We made a video about the worst idea in the history of education. I wrote the script, hired actors, and filmed it in a real one-room schoolhouse in Utah - the kind of building where American public education actually began. It's a comedy sketch, inspired by Nate Bargatze's George Washington bit on SNL, and I think you should watch it before reading the rest of this article, because it will make the history I'm about to share land differently when you realize almost none of it is exaggerated.

[VIDEO EMBED]

The sketch imagines a meeting between two 19th-century bureaucrats, one of whom has just returned from Prussia with a proposal for how to educate American children. Sort them by birth year. Grade them like beef. Ring a bell every hour to interrupt whatever they're working on. Punish anyone who moves too slowly. Give the wealthy families an exemption, of course - their children will continue to receive private tutoring, trips to museums, and horseback riding.

Every parent who watches this sketch laughs. And then, at some point during the five minutes, they stop laughing - because they recognize the system their own children are sitting inside right now.

## Who Designed the American School System?

In 1837, Horace Mann stood before the Massachusetts Board of Education with a radical proposal. Rather than letting children learn as they always had - through family, apprenticeships, and local schools - he suggested something unprecedented: a standardized system that would process students like products in a factory.

Mann had just returned from Prussia, where he'd witnessed a military education model designed to turn boys into obedient soldiers. As Isaac Morehouse and I describe in our book *[Building an Open Education](https://opened.co/book)*, Mann was less impressed with the quality of learning than with the efficiency of control. Here was a system that could take diverse, independent-minded children and transform them into a uniform, compliant workforce.

American industrialists loved the idea. Factory owners needed workers who would follow instructions without question. And so began what we now know as modern public education - not with dreams of expanding human potential, but with plans to standardize it.

Perhaps most telling was the grading system Mann adopted. The same A-F scale that meat packers used for sorting beef was applied to children. Just as Grade A meat commanded premium prices while lower grades were deemed less desirable, students would be sorted and labeled according to their ability to conform. Children were grouped by manufacture date (what we now call "grade levels"), processed in batches, and tested at regular intervals. Those who didn't fit the mold were labeled as troublemakers or failures.

This wasn't some secret conspiracy. It was all quite open, quite logical - for a world built around factories and mass production. The wealthy, of course, kept their children out of this new system entirely. Their kids continued learning through mentors, tutors, and rich experiences designed to produce leaders rather than followers. For everyone else, school became what Mann and his industrial partners intended: a place where unique human beings would be standardized into interchangeable parts.

## The Broken Promise

For over a century, this system worked exactly as designed - at least for those who designed it. But we're now using a system that existed before the lightbulb to prepare children for a world of artificial intelligence. A system built for factory workers is somehow supposed to produce the creativity, adaptability, and independent thinking that the modern economy actually rewards. It would be funny if it weren't affecting millions of lives.

A child who goes through K-12 will spend roughly 13,000 hours inside Mann's system. Two-thirds of teachers are dissatisfied with it. Parent satisfaction has dropped to a 25-year low. And the one data point that best predicts a school's test scores has nothing to do with what happens in the classroom - it's household income. As Derrell Bradford, president of 50CAN, points out, public schools are not actually tuition-free. Home prices act as tuition, creating a quasi-private system fully subsidized through high property taxes.

We spend $1.7 billion a year on standardized testing that mostly tells us which neighborhoods are wealthy.

Since the pandemic, 1.2 million students have left public schools. Homeschooling has grown from about 100,000 students in the early 1980s to 3.5 million today. Over 200,000 New York parents opted their children out of end-of-year testing in a single year. Once families got a front-row seat to what their children were actually experiencing every day, many decided they'd seen enough.

## LeBron James Is a Failure

If the Prussian grading model at least measured something meaningful, you could argue it was doing its job. But consider what happens when you apply it to people we universally recognize as excellent.

LeBron James - the greatest basketball player of his generation. Field goal percentage: 50%. By academic standards, that's an F. Three-point shooting: 35%, another F. Free throw percentage: 73%, a C- at best.

Roger Federer won 80% of his 1,526 professional tennis matches, which sounds impressive until you realize he only won 54% of the individual points he played - barely better than a coin flip. By academic standards, Federer is failing.

Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast in history, has won an Olympic medal in 61% of her events. That's a D-. If we limit it to gold medals, her score drops to 39%.

The greatest athletes alive - the people we celebrate, study, and hold up as examples of human excellence - would be on academic probation under the metrics we use to judge our children. The system confuses measurement with meaning. As Federer said in his Dartmouth commencement address: "Perfection is impossible." A champion's mindset commits fully to the next point, the next challenge. Our grading system does the opposite - it creates a permanent record of every stumble and treats a bad week like a life sentence.

## What Is Competency-Based Education?

There is a better approach, and it starts with asking a different question. Instead of "How did you perform on this one attempt?" competency-based education asks: "Have you mastered it yet?"

The grading model shifts from letter grades to two categories: "mastered" or "not yet." That word *yet* matters more than it might seem. When the system tells a child they're a failure, or that they aren't proficient enough, it damages their relationship with learning in ways that compound over years. "Not yet" reframes the entire experience. You're on your way. The door is still open.

In our book *[Building an Open Education](https://opened.co/book)*, we describe how competency-based education (also called mastery-based learning) works in practice. Students progress when they've actually mastered the material, not when the calendar says they should. Expectations are clear from the start - you know what mastery looks like before you begin. Multiple attempts are expected, not penalized. And real-world application matters more than performance on a timed test.

The research behind this approach is substantial. In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published findings that became known as the "Two Sigma Problem." Students who received one-on-one instruction combined with mastery learning performed two standard deviations better than students in conventional classrooms. In practical terms, the average student in a mastery-based setting outperformed 98% of students taught traditionally. That finding is 40 years old. The traditional system hasn't caught up.

## The Three Elements of Real Learning

My son Tanner, who holds a doctorate in education, has identified three elements at the intersection of real learning:

**Choice** means giving students some control over how, what, and when they learn. This doesn't mean letting kids do whatever they want - it means giving them voice and agency appropriate to their developmental level, so they develop the self-direction they'll need for the rest of their lives.

**Competency** means adequate time, resources, and support to actually master skills. No artificial deadlines forcing students to move forward before they're ready. If a concept takes your child a week longer than it takes someone else's child, that's fine - the goal is genuine understanding, not keeping pace with an invisible average student who doesn't actually exist.

**Connection** means learning linked to topics that matter to the learner. When students see why something is relevant to their own lives and interests, engagement follows. You don't have to manufacture motivation for a kid who is working on something they care about.

These three elements align with what psychologists call self-determination theory, and when all three are present, students who struggled in traditional settings often discover they're capable of far more than anyone - including themselves - believed.

My daughter Eliza told me at 16 that while she enjoyed learning, she found schooling painful - the stress and anxiety among her peers was overwhelming. After switching to a competency-based program, she completed her associate degree in 14 months. Since then, all five of our children have earned one or more competency-based college degrees. Many families who've made similar transitions tell us that the shift brought them back to family dinner. The conversations used to be about homework battles and slammed doors. Now the relationships are stronger for both parent and child.

## Why "Not Yet" Beats "F": The Super Mario Effect

Former NASA engineer Mark Rober ran an experiment with 50,000 people attempting a coding puzzle. He split them into two groups: one that lost points for every failed attempt, and one that faced no penalties for trying. The penalized group had a 27% success rate. The unpenalized group had a 68% success rate - and made 2.5 times as many attempts to solve the problem.

Rober calls this the "Super Mario Effect." When you die in a video game, you don't receive a permanent mark on your record. You restart with everything you learned, and you keep playing until you beat the level. The game treats failure as information, not as a verdict.

Traditional grading treats every attempt like a final exam. Competency-based education treats it like a game worth mastering.

## Competency-Based Education vs. Traditional Schooling

| Traditional Model | Competency-Based Education |
|---|---|
| Time-based: 2 weeks per unit, ready or not | Progress when you've mastered it |
| Letter grades (A-F) | Mastered or Not Yet |
| Same pace for everyone | Individual pacing |
| Gaps in understanding carry forward | Gaps addressed before advancing |
| Failure is a permanent record | Failure is part of the process |
| "What's your grade?" | "What have you mastered?" |

Sal Khan makes this comparison memorably in his TED talk on mastery learning. Imagine building a house this way, he says. The inspector shows up after two weeks, says the foundation is 75% done - that's a C+, go ahead and start the second floor. The whole structure eventually collapses, because we'd never accept 75% of a foundation in construction. But we routinely advance students who've only grasped 75% of the material they need for what comes next.

Companies are already responding to what this system produces. Google, Apple, IBM, Accenture, and Bank of America have dropped degree requirements for many positions. They've realized that credentials from the old model don't reliably predict what someone can actually do.

## Getting Started with Mastery-Based Learning

If you're homeschooling or exploring alternatives, you already have a built-in advantage - Bloom's research identified one-on-one instruction as the key variable, and that's your default setting. Several platforms are designed specifically for competency-based learning at home: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Singapore Math](https://www.singaporemath.com/), [IXL Learning](https://www.ixl.com/), [Math-U-See](https://mathusee.com/), [Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/), and [Synthesis Tutor](https://www.synthesis.com/tutor) all let students work at their own pace with clear feedback.

But the tools matter less than the mindset shift. Replace letter grades with "mastered" and "not yet." Allow flexible pacing - if your child races through science but needs more time with math, let them. If a curriculum isn't working, try a different one. The child isn't broken; it might be a mismatch between how they learn and how the material is presented. And when your child finally masters something they struggled with, mark that moment - because they've learned something more important than the content. They've learned that they can do hard things.

Isaac and I wrote *[Building an Open Education](https://opened.co/book)* for families navigating this exact transition. The book covers the history of how we got here, the research behind mastery-based approaches, and the five building blocks for creating an education that fits your child rather than forcing your child to fit the system.

## The System Was Never Designed for Your Kid

Mann's system was designed for a world that needed obedient workers and soldiers. That world is gone. Your child is growing up in a world that rewards the ability to think independently, solve novel problems, work with people across differences, and keep learning long after the test is over - and these are exactly the qualities that a system designed for compliance was built to suppress.

The two-hundred-year-old trap is losing its grip, not because parents are angry, but because millions of families are quietly discovering they have more choices than anyone told them about. And once you see what's possible, you don't go back.

Watch the sketch. Share it with someone who needs to laugh about this. And when you're ready to build something better for your family, we'll be here.
