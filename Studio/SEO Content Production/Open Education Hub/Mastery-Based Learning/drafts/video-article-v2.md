In 1837, a man named Horace Mann boarded a ship to Prussia. He was the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education - a new position, for a new idea. Public schooling. He wanted to see how the Prussians did it.

What he found was a machine. Children filed into rooms. Bells rang. They moved. Bells rang again. They sat. They memorized. They obeyed. The Prussian system wasn't built to educate. It was built to produce soldiers. Boys who would march when told, shoot when told, die when told.

Mann loved it.

Not the dying part. The obedience part. The control. He sailed home and pitched it to American industrialists, who had their own reasons: factories needed workers who would follow instructions without question.

The grading scale came from meat packers - the same A-F system used to sort beef. Students sorted by manufacture date into batches we call "grade levels." Tested at intervals. Labeled. The wealthy kept their children out. Their kids got tutors, museums, horseback riding - an education designed to produce leaders. Everyone else got the assembly line.

We made a comedy sketch about this moment. Two 19th-century bureaucrats in a room, one of them pitching Mann's system with straight-faced enthusiasm. It's a spoof - inspired by Nate Bargatze's George Washington bit on SNL - but the history behind it is real.

And 200 years later, the system is almost identical.

## The Broken Promise of Standardized Education

A child who goes through K-12 will spend roughly 13,000 hours in the system Mann designed. Two-thirds of teachers are dissatisfied. Parent satisfaction has dropped to a 25-year low. The one data point that best predicts a school's test scores has nothing to do with what happens in the classroom. It's household income.

We spend $1.7 billion a year on standardized testing. The scores tell us which neighborhoods are wealthy.

Since the pandemic, 1.2 million students have left public schools. Homeschooling has grown from 100,000 in the early 1980s to 3.5 million today. Over 200,000 New York parents opted their children out of end-of-year testing in 2022. Once families got a front-row seat to what their kids were experiencing, many decided they'd seen enough.

The question most parents are left with: if the old model is broken, what replaces it?

## LeBron James Is a Failure

Before we get to the answer, consider what the old grading model actually measures.

LeBron James. Field goal percentage: 50%. That's an F. Three-point shooting: 35%. Another F. Free throw percentage: 73%. A C- at best.

Roger Federer won 80% of his 1,526 professional tennis matches. But he only won 54% of the *points* he played. Barely better than a coin flip. By academic standards, failing.

Simone Biles has won an Olympic medal in 61% of her events. That's a D-. Gold medals only? 39%. Failing.

The greatest athletes alive would be on academic probation by the metrics we use on our children. The system confuses measurement with meaning. An 89% is fundamentally different from a 90%, and these arbitrary cutoffs follow kids through their entire academic careers. A bad week becomes a permanent record. A missed concept becomes a label.

As Federer said at Dartmouth: "Perfection is impossible." A champion's mindset commits to the next point. Our grading system does the opposite - it creates a permanent record of every stumble.

## What Is Competency-Based Education?

Competency-based education starts with a different question. Instead of "How did you perform on this one attempt?" it asks "Have you mastered it yet?"

The grading model shifts from letter grades to two categories: "mastered" or "not yet."

That word - *yet* - changes everything for a struggling kid. When the system tells a child they're a failure, it damages their relationship with learning. "Not yet" reframes the experience. You're on your way. You have runway.

This is what mastery-based learning looks like in practice:

- Students progress when they're ready, not when the calendar says so
- Clear expectations from the start - you know what mastery looks like before you begin
- Multiple attempts are the point, not the exception
- Real-world application matters more than test performance

In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published research that became known as the "Two Sigma Problem." Students who received one-on-one instruction combined with mastery learning performed two standard deviations better than students in conventional classrooms. The average tutored student outperformed 98% of traditionally taught peers.

That finding is 40 years old. The traditional system hasn't changed. But families are starting to.

## The Three Elements of Real Learning

My son Tanner, who holds a doctorate in education, identified three elements where real learning happens:

**Choice** - Some control over how, what, and when they learn. This doesn't mean kids do whatever they want. It means giving them voice and agency appropriate to their developmental level.

**Competency** - Adequate time, resources, and support to actually master skills. No artificial deadlines forcing students forward before they're ready.

**Connection** - Learning linked to topics that matter to them. When students see relevance, engagement follows.

My daughter Eliza told me at 16 that she enjoyed learning but found schooling painful - the stress and anxiety among her peers was overwhelming. After switching to a competency-based program, she completed her associate degree in 14 months. Since then, all five of our children have earned one or more competency-based college degrees.

Many families tell us that making this switch brought them back to family dinner. Conversations used to be about homework and slammed doors. Now those relationships are stronger for both parent and child.

## The Super Mario Effect

Former NASA engineer Mark Rober ran an experiment with 50,000 people attempting a coding puzzle. Group 1 lost points for failed attempts - success rate: 27%. Group 2 had no penalties for trying - success rate: 68%.

Group 2 also made 2.5 times more attempts.

Rober calls this the "Super Mario Effect." In video games, dying isn't permanent. You restart with new knowledge. There's no record of failures - just progress.

Traditional grading works like Group 1. Every mistake goes on your record. Competency-based education works like Group 2. You keep going until you've mastered it.

## Competency-Based Education vs. Traditional Schooling

| Traditional Model | Competency-Based Education |
|---|---|
| Time-based: 2 weeks per unit, ready or not | Move on when you've mastered it |
| Letter grades (A-F) | Mastered or Not Yet |
| Same pace for everyone | Individual pacing |
| Gaps carry forward | Gaps addressed before advancing |
| Failure is permanent | Failure is iteration |
| "What's your grade?" | "What have you mastered?" |

The traditional model was designed in 1837 for factories and armies. Competency-based education is designed for a world where the most valuable skills - creativity, adaptability, self-direction - are the ones the assembly line was built to suppress.

Companies already know this. Google, Apple, IBM, Accenture, Bank of America have dropped degree requirements. They care about what you can do.

## Mastery-Based Learning at Home

If you're homeschooling or considering it, you already have a built-in advantage. Bloom's research found that one-on-one instruction was the key variable. That's your default setting.

Practical ways to start:

**Replace letter grades with "mastered" and "not yet."** The conversation shifts from "you got a D" to "you haven't mastered this yet - let's figure out what's not clicking."

**Allow flexible pacing.** If your child races through one subject and needs more time on another, let them. The goal is mastery, not covering material by a date.

**Find the right curriculum.** If something isn't working, try a different approach. The child isn't broken. It might be a mismatch between their learning style and the material.

**Celebrate the breakthroughs.** A child who struggled and eventually mastered something difficult has learned more than the content. They've learned they can do hard things.

Several platforms are built for this approach: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Singapore Math](https://www.singaporemath.com/), [IXL Learning](https://www.ixl.com/), [Math-U-See](https://mathusee.com/), [Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/), [Synthesis Tutor](https://www.synthesis.com/tutor). They all let students work at their own pace with clear feedback and no penalty for the process of learning.

## The System Was Never Designed for Your Kid

Mann's system was designed for a world that needed obedient workers and soldiers. Your kid is growing up in a world that needs people who can think for themselves, solve problems nobody has encountered, and keep learning after the test is over.

The two-hundred-year-old trap is losing its grip. Not because parents are angry. Because they're discovering they have choices. And once you see the choices, you don't go back.
