# What Is Competency-Based Education? Why School Was Never Designed for Your Kid

*By Matt Bowman*

**DRAFT v5**

---

We made a video about the worst idea in the history of education. I wrote the script, hired actors, and filmed it in a real one-room schoolhouse in Utah - the kind of building where American public education actually began. It's a comedy sketch, inspired by Nate Bargatze's George Washington bit on SNL, and I think you should watch it before reading the rest of this article. What you're about to learn about competency-based education - and the history of why we don't already have it - will land differently when you realize almost none of what's in this sketch is exaggerated.

[VIDEO EMBED]

The sketch imagines a meeting between two 19th-century bureaucrats, one of whom has just returned from Prussia with a proposal for how to educate American children. Sort them by birth year. Grade them like beef. Ring a bell every hour to interrupt whatever they're working on. Punish anyone who moves too slowly. Give the wealthy families an exemption, of course - their children will continue to receive private tutoring, trips to museums, and horseback riding.

Every parent who watches this sketch laughs. And then, at some point during the five minutes, they stop laughing - because they recognize the system their own children are sitting inside right now.

## Who Designed the American School System?

In 1837, Horace Mann stood before the Massachusetts Board of Education with a radical proposal. Rather than letting children learn as they always had - through family, apprenticeships, and local schools - he suggested something unprecedented: a standardized system that would process students like products in a factory.

Mann, who was serving as Secretary of the Board at the time, had just returned from Prussia, where he'd witnessed a military education model that turned boys into obedient soldiers. As Isaac Morehouse and I describe in our book *[Open Education](https://opened.co/book)*, he was less impressed with the quality of learning than the efficiency of control. Here was a system that could take diverse, independent-minded children and transform them into a uniform, compliant workforce.

American industrialists loved the idea. Factory owners needed workers who would follow instructions without question. And so began what we now know as modern public education - not with dreams of expanding human potential, but with plans to standardize it.

Perhaps most telling about Mann's system was how it graded students using the same A-F scale that meat packers used for beef. Just as Grade A meat commanded premium prices while lower grades were deemed less desirable, students would be sorted and labeled according to their ability to conform. The system sorted children by manufacture date (what we now call "grade levels"), processed them in batches, and tested their conformity at regular intervals. Those who didn't fit the mold were labeled as "troublemakers" or "failures."

This wasn't some secret conspiracy. It was all quite open, quite logical - for a world built around factories and mass production. The wealthy, of course, kept their children out of this new system. Their kids continued learning through mentors, tutors, and rich experiences - an education designed to produce leaders rather than followers. But for everyone else, school became what Mann and his industrial partners intended: a place where unique human beings would be standardized into interchangeable parts.

## The Broken Promise

For over a century, this system worked exactly as intended - at least for those who designed it. But in the last few decades, parents and teachers began noticing that living minds don't flourish on assembly lines. Students are not dead meat.

We're still using a system designed before the lightbulb to prepare children for a world of artificial intelligence. A system created for factory workers is somehow supposed to prepare children for jobs that don't even exist yet. It would be comical if it weren't affecting millions of young lives.

What makes this especially painful is watching the tension between how children naturally learn and how we force them to learn. Any parent who has seen their child master a complex video game, build elaborate worlds in Minecraft, or dive deep into a passion project knows that kids are capable of extraordinary learning - when it matters to them. Yet we still insist on grading these dynamic, creative minds like sides of beef in a meat packing plant.

The average American child will spend over 13,000 hours in a traditional school classroom by the time they graduate from high school. That's 13,000 hours in a system where, [according to Gallup](https://opened.co/resources), two-thirds of teachers are dissatisfied, parent satisfaction is at a 25-year low, and student anxiety, bullying, and depression are rising at an alarming rate. The one data point that best predicts a school's test scores has nothing to do with what happens in the classroom - it's household income. As Derrell Bradford, president of 50CAN, points out, public schools are not actually tuition-free. Home prices act as tuition, creating a quasi-private system fully subsidized through high property taxes.

We spend $1.7 billion a year on standardized testing. The scores tell us which neighborhoods are wealthy.

Since the pandemic, 1.2 million students have left public schools. Homeschooling has grown from about 100,000 students in the early 1980s to 3.5 million today. Over 200,000 New York parents opted their children out of end-of-year testing in a single year. Once parents got a taste of alternatives during the pandemic, many started to question the status quo. They began to explore options beyond the traditional public school system, seeking out educational approaches that better fit their children's needs and their family's values.

## LeBron James Is a Failure

If the Prussian grading model at least measured something meaningful, you could argue it was doing its job. But consider what happens when you apply it to people we universally recognize as excellent.

LeBron James - the man widely considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Let's look at his report card. Field goal percentage: 50% (F). Three-point shooting: 35% (F). Free throw percentage: 73% (D+). Regular season winning percentage: 66% (D-). Finals winning percentage: 40% (F).

And he's not alone. Roger Federer, arguably the most elegant tennis player ever to grace a court, won an impressive 80% of his 1,526 professional matches - but only 54% of the individual points he played. Barely better than a coin flip. By academic standards, that's an F. Simone Biles, the most decorated gymnast in history, has won medals in 61% of her Olympic events. In school terms, she's lucky to eke out a D-. Baseball is even more extreme - the greatest hitters get out roughly twice as often as they make it on base.

Imagine if we told these athletes they were failures because they didn't score 90% of the time. Imagine if we held our children to standards that would label Michael Jordan (career shooting percentage: 49.7%) a failure. Yet every day, in classrooms across the country, we do exactly that. We take young minds as unique and varied as Federer's serve, Biles' floor routine, and James' court vision, and we reduce them to a crude letter grade that often means less than nothing.

The problem isn't just that we're grading too harshly. We're so obsessed with sorting and labeling that we've forgotten what education is actually meant to offer. As Federer said in his commencement address at Dartmouth: "When you lose every second point on average, you learn not to dwell on every shot. You teach yourself to think: Okay, I double faulted... it's only a point. Okay, I came to the net and got passed again... it's only a point." A champion's mindset commits fully to the next point, the next challenge. Our grading system does the opposite - it creates a permanent record of every stumble and treats a bad week like a life sentence.

## What Is Competency-Based Education?

There is a better approach, and it starts with asking a different question. Instead of "How did you perform on this one attempt?" competency-based education asks: "Have you mastered it yet?"

The grading model shifts from letter grades to two categories: "mastered" or "not yet." That word *yet* matters more than it might seem. When the system tells a child they're a failure, or that they aren't proficient enough, it damages their relationship with learning in ways that compound over years. "Not yet" reframes the entire experience. You're on your way. The door is still open.

In our book *[Open Education](https://opened.co/book)*, we describe how competency-based education (also called mastery-based learning) works in practice. Students progress when they've actually mastered the material, not when the calendar says they should. Expectations are clear from the start - you know what mastery looks like before you begin. Multiple attempts are expected, not penalized. And real-world application matters more than performance on a timed test.

This isn't about lowering standards - quite the opposite. In traditional schools, students routinely advance with Cs and Ds, moving forward without truly mastering the material. Remember that old saying, "Cs get degrees"? In competency-based education, you either demonstrate mastery or you keep working. There's no settling for "close enough."

The research behind this approach is substantial. In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published findings that became known as the "Two Sigma Problem." Students who received one-on-one instruction combined with mastery learning performed two standard deviations better than students in conventional classrooms. In practical terms, the average student in a mastery-based setting outperformed 98% of students taught traditionally. That finding is 40 years old. The traditional system hasn't caught up.

## The Three Elements of Real Learning

My son Tanner, after years of research and a doctorate in education, identified something that changed how our family thinks about learning - true learning happens at the intersection of three elements:

**Choice** means giving students some control over how, what, and when they learn. This doesn't mean letting kids do whatever they want - it means giving them voice and agency appropriate to their developmental level, so they develop the self-direction they'll need for the rest of their lives. As psychology professor Dan Ariely has found, a person's willingness to work hard at something is directly tied to how meaningful they perceive the task to be. Through freedom of choice, a young person who wants to learn something will often do it through whatever means are necessary.

**Competency** means adequate time, resources, and support to actually master skills. No artificial deadlines forcing students to move forward before they're ready. If a concept takes your child a week longer than it takes someone else's child, that's fine - the goal is genuine understanding, not keeping pace with an invisible average student who doesn't actually exist.

**Connection** means learning linked to topics that matter to the learner. When children explore their interests, it creates the authentic energy needed for them to learn to read, write, and do math. Real motivation doesn't have to be forced. You don't have to manufacture engagement for a kid who is working on something they care about.

When these three elements come together, something remarkable happens. My daughter Eliza was a capable student, but at sixteen she found traditional schooling painfully rigid. The stress and anxiety among her peers was overwhelming. After exploring different options, she enrolled in a competency-based program that used the "mastered" or "not yet" model. Instead of racing to keep pace with arbitrary deadlines, she could focus on truly mastering each concept before moving forward. She completed her associate degree in fourteen months - not because she rushed, but because she could progress at her own pace, taking more time when she needed it and accelerating when she was ready. Since then, all five of our children have earned one or more competency-based college degrees.

Many families who've made similar transitions tell us that the shift brought them back to family dinner. The conversations used to be about homework battles and slammed doors. Now the relationships are stronger for both parent and child.

## Why "Not Yet" Beats "F": The Super Mario Effect

Former NASA engineer Mark Rober ran an experiment with 50,000 people attempting a coding puzzle. He split them into two groups: one that lost points for every failed attempt, and one that faced no penalties for trying. The penalized group had a 27% success rate. The unpenalized group had a 68% success rate - and made 2.5 times as many attempts to solve the problem.

Rober calls this the "Super Mario Effect." When you die in a video game, you don't receive a permanent mark on your record. You restart with everything you learned, and you keep playing until you beat the level. The game treats failure as information, not as a verdict.

Traditional grading treats every attempt like a final exam. Competency-based education treats it like a game worth mastering.

## Competency-Based Education vs. Traditional Schooling

| Traditional Model | Competency-Based Education |
|---|---|
| Time-based: 2 weeks per unit, ready or not | Progress when you've mastered it |
| Letter grades (A-F) | Mastered or Not Yet |
| Same pace for everyone | Individual pacing |
| Gaps in understanding carry forward | Gaps addressed before advancing |
| Failure is a permanent record | Failure is part of the process |
| "What's your grade?" | "What have you mastered?" |

Sal Khan makes this comparison memorably in his TED talk on mastery learning. Imagine building a house this way, he says. The inspector shows up after two weeks, says the foundation is 75% done - that's a C+, go ahead and start the second floor. The whole structure eventually collapses, because we'd never accept 75% of a foundation in construction. But we routinely advance students who've only grasped 75% of the material they need for what comes next.

Companies are already responding to what this system produces. Google, Apple, IBM, Accenture, and Bank of America have dropped degree requirements for many positions. They've realized that credentials from the old model don't reliably predict what someone can actually do. At Southern New Hampshire University's competency-based program, 70% of participating high school seniors graduated with college degrees before they even finished high school - not because they were "exceptional" students, but because they were given the freedom to learn at their own pace and demonstrate mastery in their own way.

## Getting Started with Mastery-Based Learning

If you're homeschooling or exploring alternatives, you already have a built-in advantage - Bloom's research identified one-on-one instruction as the key variable, and that's your default setting. Several platforms are designed specifically for competency-based learning at home: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Singapore Math](https://www.singaporemath.com/), [IXL Learning](https://www.ixl.com/), [Math-U-See](https://mathusee.com/), [Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/), and [Synthesis Tutor](https://www.synthesis.com/tutor) all let students work at their own pace with clear feedback.

But the tools matter less than the mindset shift. Replace letter grades with "mastered" and "not yet." The conversation shifts from "you got a D" to "you haven't mastered this yet - let's figure out what's not clicking." Allow flexible pacing - if your child races through science but needs more time with math, let them. If a curriculum isn't working, try a different one. The child isn't broken; it might be a mismatch between how they learn and how the material is presented. And when your child finally masters something they struggled with, mark that moment - because they've learned something more important than the content. They've learned that they can do hard things.

Isaac and I wrote *[Open Education](https://opened.co/book)* for families navigating this exact transition. The book covers the history of how we got here, the research behind mastery-based approaches, and the five building blocks for creating an education that fits your child rather than forcing your child to fit the system.

## The System Was Never Designed for Your Kid

Even today, Mann's system shapes our children's lives. Every weekday morning, millions of unique young minds file into buildings designed to make them more alike. The simplicity of the promise remains seductive: follow the set path - good grades, college, steady job, retirement - and success will follow. But that promise has expired. Not just because it's failing to deliver (though it is - ask any recent college graduate about their student debt), but because it's preparing our children for a world that's already disappeared.

Your child is growing up in a world that rewards the ability to think independently, solve novel problems, work with people across differences, and keep learning long after the test is over. The two-hundred-year-old trap of standardized education is losing its grip - not because parents are angry, but because millions of families are quietly discovering they have more choices than anyone told them about. And once you see what's possible, you don't go back.

Watch the sketch. Share it with someone who needs to laugh about this. And when you're ready to build something better for your family, we'll be here.
