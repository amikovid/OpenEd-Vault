# Horace Mann Video Launch - Progress Log

---

## Session 1: 2026-02-03

### What happened
- Created project folder and planning documents
- Explored OpenEd Vault for Eddy Awards timeline, content strategy, and production capabilities
- Reviewed Slack conversation between Matt, Isaac, Ela, and Charlie about the video
- Analyzed the script transcript
- Mapped video launch to Eddy Awards timeline (Feb 17 alignment)

### Key decisions
- Video launch should align with Eddys public launch (Feb 17)
- The video is the "opening salvo" - satirizes the old system, Eddys celebrate the new one
- Need native uploads to all platforms (not just YouTube links)
- Include "Nate Bargatze SNL spoof" in SEO metadata

### Content pieces identified
1. Finalized video with branding
2. Matt's origin story article (in his voice)
3. Dedicated newsletter (special edition)
4. Podcast episode (Matt + Isaac)
5. Social content suite (clips, photos, text posts)

### Open questions
- Exact launch date: Feb 17 or earlier?
- Podcast recording timeline
- Remaining video edits needed
- How prominently to feature Eddy Awards in launch content

### Next steps
- Get Charlie's decisions on open questions
- Begin drafting Matt's origin story article
- Outline podcast episode structure
- Plan social content calendar for launch week

## Session 1 (continued): Charter + Judges

### What happened
- Moved all planning files into Eddie Awards project folder
- Created **The Open Education Charter** draft (`open-education-charter.md`) - 10 principles, Declaration of Independence energy
- Found and reviewed the full OpenEd StoryBrand script (in identity-framework.md) - used as source for Charter principles
- Found and reviewed the strategic narrative document - Prussian model history, Great Education Unbundling, core principles
- Researched judges status: 27 candidates in Google Doc, need to finalize 3-5 by March 8
- Updated task plan with Charter, judges timeline, podcast recording schedule

### Decisions made
- Podcast: Record week of Feb 10, edit by Feb 17
- Charter added as a new content piece (alongside article, newsletter, podcast)
- Judges should be announced during hype week (Feb 17-28), finalized from Google Doc

### Charter principles (summary)
1. Education should fit the child, not the child the system
2. Standards, not standardization
3. Standards, not standardization
4. Curiosity is the engine, agency is the fuel
5. Learning happens everywhere
6. Replace the old through creativity, not anger
7. The future belongs to the resourceful, not the obedient
8. Open education is not one approach - it is all of them
9. Every family deserves access, not just the wealthy
10. We celebrate the pioneers

### Open items
- Charlie to edit the Charter draft
- Charter naming: "Charter" vs "Declaration" vs "10 Principles"
- Judges: who from the 27 candidates? Get on this ASAP
- Matt's article draft needs to be started
