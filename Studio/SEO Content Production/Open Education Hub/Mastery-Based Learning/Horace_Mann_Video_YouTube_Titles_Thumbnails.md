## Recommended YouTube Description

```
In 1837, Horace Mann returned from Prussia with an idea: educate American children like you'd train soldiers. Sort them by age. Grade them like meat. Ring bells. Punish anyone who moves too slowly.

We made a comedy sketch about it - inspired by Nate Bargatze's George Washington SNL skit.

The punchline? Almost nothing has changed.

Filmed at a real one-room schoolhouse (Taylorsville-Bennion Heritage Center) with a real punishment chart still on the wall. Written by Matt Bowman, founder of OpenEd.

## Recommendation

**Title 1** ("The Man Who Ruined School") is the strongest. It uses the #9 person framework (proven high performer), triggers curiosity + negativity + specificity, passes the McDonald's test, and the Bargatze connection in parentheses serves both SEO and context without filtering the audience.

**Title 3** is the runner-up for a more serious/educational angle.

**Thumbnail Option A from Title 1** paired with the title creates strong complementarity - the title names the person, the thumbnail makes it personal ("YOUR school").
