# Critical Analysis: AI Tutors Article v4

## Your Bracketed Comments Addressed

### 1. Line 15: Incomplete transition
**Current:** "Can AI finally solve the 2 Sigma Problem, and <>"
**Issue:** Sentence trails off
**Fix:** Complete the thought: "Can AI finally solve the 2 Sigma Problem—giving every child access to personalized instruction without the $100/hour price tag?"

---

### 2. Line 25: "Under the hood" is cliché
**Current:** "Before diving into specific tools, it helps to understand what's actually happening under the hood."
**Better options:**
- "Before diving into specific tools, it helps to understand what AI tutors actually do—and don't do."
- "To evaluate these tools, you need to know how they actually work."
- Just delete the intro sentence and start with Honeycutt's quote.

---

### 3. Line 51: "The Quality Divide Nobody Talks About" - cringe
**Better titles:**
- "Why Most AI Tutoring Platforms Fail"
- "Free vs. Paid: The Hidden Tradeoff"
- "The Business Model Problem"
- "When Free Isn't Worth It"

---

### 4. Line 79: Need to explain Recess and Synthesis
**Add after Ben Somers intro:**
"Synthesis is a learning platform that grew out of a school founded by SpaceX engineers—originally designed to teach the children of SpaceX employees through collaborative problem-solving challenges. Somers later founded Recess, which takes a similar approach to creative learning."

---

### 5. Line 93: Weird transition to research paragraph
**Problem:** We jump from listing platform types straight to "The research behind these techniques isn't new" without connection.
**Fix:** Add transition: "What separates the effective platforms from the mediocre ones often comes down to whether they're built on actual learning science—or just gamification."

---

### 6. Line 107: Needs "In other words" transition
**Current:** Ravaglia quote then "The issue isn't the technology."
**Fix:** "His point isn't that technology fails—it's that technology alone isn't enough."

---

### 7. Line 113: "Which is close to free" - who said this?
**Issue:** Attribution unclear
**Fix:** It's Somers. Make it: "'The number one predictor of retention was if the kid had a friend in their class,' Somers says. 'Not the games. Not the AI. Friendship—which is close to free.'"

---

### 8. Lines 115 & 130: Redundancy with Honeycutt and AI can/can't lists
**Problem:** We say what AI can't do THREE times:
1. Early section: "AI can't have unique ideas..."
2. Honeycutt quote in "What AI Can't Replace": "Education isn't simply the knowing of things..."
3. Bullet lists of AI can/can't

**Fix:** Cut the Honeycutt repetition in section 4. Keep her insight ONCE (early), then just use Ray/Ben for the human connection angle. The bullet lists are fine—they're actionable.

---

### 9. Line 140: Clarify Alpha School is in-person
**Current:** "programs like Alpha School, which uses AI-powered adaptive learning..."
**Fix:** "You may have heard of programs like [Alpha School](https://alpha.school/), an in-person private school in Austin and Miami that uses AI-powered adaptive learning to compress academics into roughly two hours a day..."

---

### 10. Line 152: Screen time section needs room to breathe
**Problem:** We rush through multiple expert quotes without letting any land.
**Fix:** See expanded section below.

## Major Structural Issues

### 1. MISSING: Brettani Shannon / Perplexity Example

This is a DIFFERENT approach to AI that deserves its own moment. Not adaptive apps—using AI as a curriculum design tool.

**Where to add:** After the tool tables, before or after "How to Actually Use These Tools"

**Proposed section:**

---

## Beyond Apps: AI as Your Curriculum Design Partner

Adaptive learning apps are one way to use AI. There's another approach worth considering.

[Brettani Shannon](https://opened.co/blog/opened-day-in-the-life-brettani-shannons-slow-morning-ai-powered-unit-studies-curriculum), an Oregon homeschool mom featured in our Day in the Life series, uses [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)—an AI research tool—not to teach her daughter directly, but to design custom unit studies based on her interests.

Her 9-year-old, Snow, loves animals. Instead of buying a generic biology curriculum, Brettani asked Perplexity:

*"Create a 4-day-a-week unit study for a 4th grader who loves animals. Focus on Pet Adoption. Give me book lists, movie suggestions, vocabulary/spelling words, and hands-on activities."*

"This gave me a roadmap," she explains. "I liked most of what it produced—dog treat recipe, field trip idea to a shelter, movie suggestion—so I continued: 'Give me links to a specific dog treat recipe and 4th grade math lessons to incorporate.'"

The AI isn't teaching. It's brainstorming. Brettani still curates, edits, and decides what actually happens. But it dramatically cuts her planning time.

This approach works especially well for science and history—subjects where adaptive apps are less developed. Instead of hunting for the perfect curriculum, you can build one around what your child already cares about.

### 2. MISSING: Science & History Apps

The tool tables are heavily weighted toward math and language. Science and history options are thin.

**What exists (add to tables):**

**Science:**
- **Generation Genius** - Video-based science lessons, less adaptive but high quality
- **Mystery Science** - Inquiry-based, not truly adaptive but excellent for K-5
- **Labster** - Virtual science labs (more for older students)
- **Khan Academy** - Has science content with some adaptive practice

**History/Social Studies:**
- **iCivics** - Civics games and simulations
- **Khan Academy** - History content with practice
- **Quizlet** - Flashcard-based, now has AI features

**The honest truth:** Adaptive learning is much less developed for science and history than for math. This is why Brettani's Perplexity approach matters—for subjects without good adaptive tools, AI-assisted curriculum design fills the gap.

### 3. Pacing Problems: Where It's Too Rushed

**Section: "What AI Tutors Actually Do"**
- We list four things AI does well, but each gets only one sentence
- The contrast between "what AI does" and "what AI can't do" is abrupt
- **Fix:** Add a brief example or two. Show, don't just tell.

**Section: "How Adaptive Learning Actually Works"**
- We list four categories of platforms but don't give any of them room
- Then jump to research paragraph that feels disconnected
- **Fix:** Either trim the categories to 2-3 with more depth, or add a sentence of "so what" after each

**Section: "The Screen Time Question"**
- Three expert quotes rapid-fire with no breathing room
- **Fix:** See expanded version below

## The Screen Time Question

Here's where most parents hesitate.

You've probably spent years limiting screens. Maybe you've read the studies on attention, sleep, dopamine. Now this article is telling you to add MORE screen time?

Let's reframe.

[Amir Nathoo](https://opened.co/podcast/dont-limit-screentime), CEO of [Outschool](https://outschool.com/), puts it simply: "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different from building a virtual world or learning a tool."

There's passive screen time—scrolling, watching, consuming. And there's active screen time—creating, problem-solving, practicing skills with immediate feedback. Adaptive learning apps fall into the second category.

[Anjan Katta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjankatta/), founder of [Daylight Computer](https://daylightcomputer.com/) (which makes screens specifically designed to reduce physiological stress), is pragmatic about this: "It's unrealistic and probably not in the best interest of your child's development to be a Luddite—to completely get away with technology."

His framing of the real value proposition is worth sitting with: "The promise here is not 'my kid's gonna be a million times smarter.' It's that instead of four hours with more tantrums and more difficulty, it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes, they're engaged, and now there's more time."

More time for field trips. For projects. For play and conversation and the unstructured exploration that makes homeschooling worthwhile in the first place.

That's the real tradeoff. Not "screens vs. no screens"—but "what are you using screens FOR, and what does it free you to do?"

We've written more about [navigating screen time quality over quantity](https://opened.co/blog/screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution) if you want to go deeper.

## Other Suggestions

### 1. Add brief tool descriptions in tables
Instead of just "Conceptual understanding, collaborative problem-solving" for Synthesis, could add one sentence about what it actually IS.

### 2. Consider a "What We'd Recommend" summary
After all the tables, a simple "If you're just getting started, here's where we'd begin" with 2-3 picks per subject.

### 3. The conclusion feels rushed
The current ending is fine but generic. Consider calling back to something specific from the opening—the 2 Sigma Problem, for instance.
