### Episode 022 - Keri Mae (Working Mom, Former Kindergarten Teacher)

**Context:** Single mom with 3 boys, worked as public school kindergarten teacher, degree in early childhood development. Middle son is autistic with sensory processing issues.

**Key Quote on Waldorf + Montessori:**
> "I love the Montessori method. It's near and dear to my heart as an early childhood educator, that and Waldorf. And so I searched high and low and I found this charter school. It's a public charter school. So it's free, right? Because as a single mom, there's financial constraints. And it's been phenomenal."

**Why Montessori Worked for Her Autistic Son:**
> "They don't have bells at all. It's just the teachers are out there and gently reminding them, and they come gather them in at the same time. And it's just a different flow to the school day that all of the problems we had previously were just gone because of the way they ran their school."

> "They have special slippers that they wear at school, so if he wants to be barefoot, he's allowed to."

**On the Montessori Approach to Learning:**
> "I just provide the resources and then they take off with it... I provide things like music books and we use like Simply Piano, you know, as an online, you know, that's on a tablet that my son can pull up and he'll spend like two hours just sitting at the piano."

### "3 kids, 3 different schools, 1 surprising lesson" (Dec 2025)

**The Colleen Kelly Story (Business Insider):**

> "Colleen Kelly writes in Business Insider that she started her parenting journey with firm convictions. Waldorf. Montessori. Whole-child learning. Anything but public school, which she saw as a factory for cookie-cutter kids."

> "This worked for years. But as her kids got older and life threw curveballs (single mom, three kids, limited bandwidth), she faced a choice: keep white-knuckling a homeschool approach that wasn't working, or try something new."

> "With great reluctance, she enrolled them in public school. Two out of three thrived. Her middle child didn't—but rather than accepting this as inevitable, she found an online charter."

**Key Quote:**
> **"An ideal education didn't just look different for my family," she writes, "but for each child within it."**

> "Today, all three are on different paths: one enrolled in a private academy, another does online school with a gifted plan, and a third is back to homeschooling."

**OpenEd Framing:**
> "This embodies what Matt Bowman calls the open education mindset: you're not locked into the approach you chose five years ago. Different kids need different things, and different stages call for different solutions."
