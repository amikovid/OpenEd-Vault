## Differentiation Angle

**What makes this OpenEd's piece:**
- Both methods emerged from Italy (Maria Montessori in Rome, Loris Malaguzzi in Reggio Emilia)
- Both are child-led but with very different philosophies:
  - Montessori: Individual child, prepared environment, specific materials
  - Reggio: Community learning, emergent curriculum, the "hundred languages" of children
- OpenEd angle: Project-based, inquiry-driven learning aligns with Reggio; self-directed with materials aligns with Montessori
- Connect to existing Waldorf vs Montessori article
