### Hook Options (Choose 1)

**A. The Destroyed Interest (Jack Casdorph)**
"The experiment took 25 seconds. The writeup took 30 minutes. And that's when my interest in science was totally destroyed."

**B. The Treehouse Response**
When Jack asked his dad to build him a treehouse, his father's response changed everything: "Nope. But I can help YOU build one."

**C. Mark Rober Frame**
110 million people subscribe to watch a former NASA engineer build glitter bombs and squirrel obstacle courses. What does that tell us about how humans actually want to learn?

**D. The Super Mario Effect (Data-Driven)**
When Mark Rober gave 50,000 people a coding puzzle, one group lost points for mistakes. The other didn't. The no-penalty group succeeded 68% of the time vs. 27% - and tried 2.5x more often. He calls it the "Super Mario Effect": in the game, dying isn't failure. It's data.

---

### Section 3: The Benefits of Project-Based Learning
**Target:** "benefits of project based learning" (260 vol)

**The Super Mario Effect (Mark Rober data):**
- 50,000 participants in coding puzzle
- Group 1 (lost points for failures): 27% success
- Group 2 (no penalties): 68% success, 2.5x more attempts
- "In the game, dying isn't a setback. You restart and try again."

**Quote:** "Thinking like an engineer means you're resilient. It's getting back up after being knocked down and approaching things differently." - Mark Rober

Three evidence-backed advantages:

1. **Motivation becomes intrinsic**
   - Fourth-grader egg business example
   - Darryll Stinson's kids running businesses

2. **Subject boundaries dissolve**
   - Chicken keeping = math + biology + civics + entrepreneurship
   - No more "when will I ever use this?"

3. **Children learn at their natural pace**
   - Different timelines, same meaningful outcomes
   - Research: Edutopia study on PBL outperforming traditional

**Mention:** Sesame Street scientific method - "I wonder, what if, let's try"

### Section 5: How to Start - The Two-Week Sprint Method
**Target:** "7 steps of project based learning" (50 vol) + "hands on learning activities" (320 vol)

**The OpenEd Framework (from Open Education book):**

1. **Create a Discovery Zone** - Wall, poster board, or back of door
2. **Post the five questions:**
   - What do I like to learn about?
   - What do I like to do in my free time?
   - What am I good at?
   - What would I like to get better at?
   - What do I genuinely dislike?
3. **Give everyone colored sticky notes** - One color per family member
4. **One week of adding thoughts** - No judgment, no editing
5. **Pick one interest per person** - For a two-week "learning sprint"
6. **Execute the sprint** - Resources, field trips, hands-on work
7. **Reflect and iterate** - What worked? What's next?

**Quote:** "The hard part is trusting that your kid's curiosity is a better compass than a pacing guide written for 30 strangers."

### Section 6: The Mars Approach to Curriculum
**Unique OpenEd angle**

NASA's Curiosity rover challenge: How do you design something to explore a world you've never visited?

Three essential questions:
- What does Mars need us to discover?
- What unique capabilities can we develop?
- What resources do we have?

"Your child's educational landscape is an unmapped terrain waiting to be explored. You can't use someone else's map or calendar."
