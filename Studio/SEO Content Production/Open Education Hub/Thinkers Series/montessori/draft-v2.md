# Maria Montessori and the Family Secret That Shaped Her Legacy

For fourteen years, Maria Montessori pretended her son didn't exist.

She visited him in the countryside outside Rome, watched him grow, but never told him she was his mother. To acknowledge him would have ended everything - her career as Italy's first female physician, her credibility as an education reformer, her chance to change how the world thinks about children.

## A Radical Path from Physician to Educator

Maria Montessori was born in 1870 in Chiaravalle, Italy. Her father wanted her to become a teacher, the respectable path for educated women, but she refused.

At thirteen, she enrolled in an all-boys technical school to study engineering. Then she changed course again, deciding to pursue medicine. The University of Rome initially rejected her application. Undaunted, Montessori took additional courses, reapplied, and was finally admitted.

In 1896, she became the first woman in Italy to earn a medical degree, and spent her early career focused on psychiatry.

She worked at the University of Rome's psychiatric clinic, visiting asylums to observe children with intellectual disabilities. What she saw there planted a seed that would eventually transform education worldwide.

The children in these institutions were considered unteachable. They were warehoused, not educated. 

But Montessori noticed something remarkable: given the right materials and environment, these children could learn. Some of them, using her methods, passed the same standardized exams as children in regular schools.

If her approach worked for children everyone had written off, what might it do for children with no disabilities at all? The world would soon find out.

## Maria Montessori’s Secret Son

While working at the Orthophrenic School, an institute for developmentally challenged children, Maria Montessori fell in love with a fellow physician named Giuseppe Montesano. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, Mario, in 1898.

For an unmarried woman in turn-of-the-century Italy, even one with a medical degree, an illegitimate child was sacrilegious. So Montessori gave in to family pressure and to Giuseppe Montesano’s power and pride, and made a choice that would haunt her for years: she gave Mario to another family to raise in the countryside near Rome.

Over the next fourteen years she visited her son regularly and watched him grow, but never told him she was his mother. Acknowledging him would have meant professional ruin and ended everything she’d worked hard for.

But having a baby out of wedlock wasn’t Montessori’s only crisis. Her love, Montesano, refused to recognize Mario as his own and refused to consider marriage. He betrayed Montessori shortly after and married another woman.

Devastated, Montessori went into seclusion and emerged with newfound resolution. She left her post as co-director of the Orthophrenic School and shifted her focus from medicine to the mind, taking courses in anthropology, psychology, and philosophy at the University of Rome.

In 1913, following the death of her mother, Montessori revealed her true identity to Mario. She brought him to Rome to live with her, but initially introduced him as her nephew (to protect her reputation) and later as her adopted son.

Despite this, Mario Montessori grew close to his mother and became her greatest collaborator. For the next forty years, Mario and Montessori were inseparable. He traveled across continents with her, helped run her training courses, and co-founded the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) with her.

The Montessori method soon spread across Europe and America, and Mario accompanied Montessori on her missions until her death in 1952.

The son Montessori once had to hide thus became the loyal partner who helped her change the world.

## How the Montessori Method Began

In 1907, Montessori opened her first school, Casa dei Bambini, or “Children's House,” in a modest single classroom. She’d been asked to help educate children from underprivileged backgrounds, so she established her school in the slums of San Lorenzo, one of Rome's poorest neighborhoods.

Her students ranged from three to six years old and came from families where both parents worked long factory hours. Local authorities had tried but failed to keep these children off the streets. When the children arrived at Casa dei Bambini, however, incredible things happened.

Those who were previously unable to sit still were spending twenty minutes transferring beans with tweezers, building the fine motor control they would need to write. Children who had never seen a book were teaching themselves to read. And strangest of all to visitors: these children preferred work to play. Given the choice between toys and learning materials, they chose the materials.

Montessori documented everything like the scientist she was, observing, adjusting, and testing. Within months, observers were traveling from across Europe to see the revolutionary approach in her school.

What emerged was a set of principles that contradicted almost everything educators believed:

### Children teach themselves

Adults don't pour knowledge into children. Rather, they act as “guides,” preparing an environment, offering materials, and stepping back. The child's own curiosity, combined with freedom of movement, does the rest.

### Concrete before abstract

Children understand addition by physically combining objects long before they can handle numbers on a page. The body learns before the mind.

### The materials correct the child

A puzzle piece that doesn't fit tells the child to try again. No teacher needs to mark errors. No shame ensues.

### Mixed ages work

Younger children learn from older ones. Older children mentor their younger classmates and reinforce what they’ve learned by teaching it to others. Multi-age classrooms develop leadership skills, empathy, collaboration, and effective communication.

Her first book, published in 1909 and translated into English as [*The Montessori Method*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29635) in 1912, spread these ideas worldwide. Within years, Montessori schools were opening across Europe, India, and the United States.

## Maria Montessori in Exile

Success made Montessori a target when Europe went into political turmoil.

In 1933, the Nazi regime closed every Montessori school in Germany. In Berlin, they burned her books and an effigy of her likeness.

Mussolini proved more complicated. The Italian dictator initially supported Montessori schools, seeing them as a source of national pride. But he wanted something in return: children in Fascist uniforms, giving the Fascist salute.

Montessori refused, and by 1936, every Montessori school in Italy was shuttered. Montessori, now in her sixties, went into exile. She moved to Spain, then fled again as civil war broke out.

When World War II erupted, the British government interned Mario (an Italian citizen) as an enemy alien. Montessori was placed under house arrest, leading to mother and son being separated again by forces beyond their control.

For her seventieth birthday, Montessori made a single request to the Indian government: release my son. 

They agreed, and in 1939, Montessori and Mario accepted an invitation to give a three-month training course in India. They expected to return to Europe by winter but didn't leave for seven years.

Together, Montessori and her son spent the war years training over 1,500 Indian teachers. The catastrophe of exile became a serendipitous opportunity to spread her ideas across an entire subcontinent.

## Montessori’s Final Years

After the war, Montessori and Mario returned to Europe. She spent her final years in the Netherlands, still traveling and lecturing into her eighties.

Montessori was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times: in 1949, 1950, and 1951. She never won, but the nominations reflected something important: Montessori saw education as fundamentally about peace. She believed that children raised to think independently would be harder to manipulate into war.

"Establishing lasting peace is the work of education," Montessori wrote. "All politics can do is keep us out of war."

Maria Montessori died on May 6, 1952, at age eighty-one. Mario continued her work until his own death in 1982, ensuring that the method they built together would outlast them both.

## Montessori’s Influence on Modern Education

There are now over 20,000 Montessori schools worldwide, including public schools, magnet schools, and charter schools. Maria Montessori’s books remain in print. Her child-centered approach shapes [microschools](https://opened.co/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-microschools-the-educational-trend-growing-faster-than-homeschooling), homeschool families, and early childhood programs across every continent.

What Montessori discovered in Roman slums and Indian exile still works today. Her pedagogy has proven remarkably durable; not because it was clever marketing, but because it was built on observation of how children actually develop.

Consider mixed-age learning: when Montessori grouped children across ages in 1907, conventional educators thought it reckless. A century later, traditional public schools are [adopting multi-age classrooms](https://opened.co/newsletter/mixed-age-learning-takes-off-131) because research confirms, as Montessori had observed, that younger children progress faster with older peers, older children deepen mastery through teaching, and everyone develops stronger social-emotional skills.

Educator Ana Lorena Fabrega put it simply: "When in the real world do you only interact with people your age?"

The only other example anyone can name is 19th-century Prussian military camps, where modern schools got the idea in the first place.

The [Montessori curriculum](https://opened.co/blog/montessori-curriculum-for-homeschooling) divides learning into interconnected areas:

* Practical life skills that build concentration and coordination  
* Sensorial materials that develop perception  
* Language that moves from physical letters to reading  
* Mathematics that starts with objects you can hold  
* Cultural studies that connect everything to the larger world.

For elementary children, Montessori developed what she called a “Cosmic Education” that underpins her primary curriculum. Cosmic Education introduces children to the wonders of the world through the Five Great Lessons: a “big picture” view that covers the origins of the universe, life, humans, writing, and numbers. These lessons demonstrate how science, history, language, art, and geography are all interconnected. Children see knowledge as unified, not fragmented into singular subjects.

Her ideas anticipated discoveries that wouldn't come for decades. Neuroscientists now confirm what Montessori observed: young children have "absorbent minds" that soak up their environment effortlessly. The concrete-to-abstract progression she championed matches how the brain actually builds understanding.

## What Parents Can Take from Montessori

You don't need expensive materials or a Montessori classroom to apply Maria’s insights. Here's what her work suggests for any family:

### Observe before intervening

When your child struggles, wait. Watch. Often they'll solve the problem themselves—and learn more from solving it than from your help.

### Offer real tools, not toys

Children want to participate in real life. A child-sized broom, a step stool at the kitchen counter, actual glasses instead of sippy cups. They develop the confidence to manage everyday tasks independently and rise to meet real responsibilities.

### Prepare the environment

Instead of controlling your child, control their surroundings. Put things at their level. Make it possible for them to be independent. Demonstrate how to do something, then invite your child to do it themselves.

### Trust the timeline

Children develop different skills at different rates. Montessori's observations showed that pushing before readiness backfires, while waiting for genuine interest produces lasting learning.

### Let mistakes teach

When a cup of water spills, it’s a natural learning opportunity—not a failure or mistake requiring correction. The Montessori method empowers children to clean up their own spills. The more children learn that actions have consequences, the less they need adults to evaluate them.

## Leaders Shaped by the Montessori Method

Maria Montessori’s educational approach has influenced some of the world’s brightest leaders and notable figures in technology and the arts. In 2011, the Wall Street Journal coined a term for this elite class of Montessori-educated alumni: the [Montessori Mafia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-IMB-2034).

Chef and author Julia Child, former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, Grammy Award winners Taylor Swift and Beyoncé Knowles, and NBA player Stephen Curry all attended Montessori schools.

When Barbara Walters asked Larry Page if having professor parents explained Google's success, he pointed elsewhere:

"We both went to Montessori school, and I think it was part of that training of not following rules and orders, and being self-motivated, questioning what's going on in the world, doing things a little bit differently."

The pattern makes sense. Montessori education emphasizes self-direction, intrinsic motivation, and the confidence to pursue your own questions. Those traits matter more in a world where following instructions is increasingly automated.

Ben Mann, co-founder of AI company Anthropic, recently explained why his daughter attends Montessori: "If this were 10 or 20 years ago, I'd be lining her up for top-tier schools and extracurriculars. But now I don't think any of it's going to matter. Learning facts is going to fade into the background. What matters is that she's happy, thoughtful, curious, and kind."

The skills that Montessori develops—creativity, independence, self-regulation—become more valuable, not less, as artificial intelligence transforms what humans need to do.
