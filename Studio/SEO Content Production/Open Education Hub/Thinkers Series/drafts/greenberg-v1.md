## ARTICLE

# Daniel Greenberg: The Man Who Trusted Children

When Daniel Greenberg died in December 2021, Peter Gray wrote a tribute with a simple title: "The Man Who Trusted Children."

After 53 years at the school he founded, that trust had become something rarer than philosophy. It had become proof.

Sudbury Valley School opened in 1968 in Framingham, Massachusetts with a premise most educators considered reckless: children don't need to be taught. Give them freedom, responsibility, and a community of mixed ages, and they will educate themselves.

No curriculum. No grades. No required classes. Students as young as four making real decisions about how to spend their days. It sounded like an experiment destined to fail spectacularly.

Instead, it's been running continuously for over five decades. Graduates have gone on to careers in medicine, law, engineering, entrepreneurship, and the arts. [Peter Gray](https://opened.co/blog/peter-gray), the evolutionary psychologist who studied the school for years, found that students who had never taken a formal class until college performed just as well as their traditionally-schooled peers once they got there.

The experiment worked. And Greenberg spent his life explaining why.

## From Physics to Philosophy

Daniel Greenberg was a physics professor at Columbia University when he faced a crisis familiar to many parents: he couldn't send his own children to traditional school.

The contradiction was too sharp. He spent his days encouraging students to question assumptions, follow curiosity, and think independently. Then he was supposed to send his kids to institutions that demanded the opposite - sit still, follow instructions, accept what authorities tell you.

So he built something else.

In 1968, Greenberg gathered a group of about twenty founding members and opened Sudbury Valley School with sixty students. The school took its name from the Sudbury River valley where it sits on a ten-acre campus of woods, fields, and an old farmhouse.

From the beginning, the school operated on principles that seemed radical then and still seem radical now.

## How Sudbury Valley Works

Walk into Sudbury Valley on any given day and you might see a cluster of teenagers debating philosophy in the library, a six-year-old teaching herself to read by asking older kids for help, a group fishing in the pond, and another group coding video games on computers.

What you won't see: classrooms with rows of desks, teachers lecturing, bells signaling the end of periods, or anyone checking to make sure students are "on task."

The school operates on a few core principles:

**Students choose what to learn.** There are no required subjects. If a student wants to spend three years focused entirely on music, they can. If another wants to master calculus at age ten, resources are available. If someone wants to spend months apparently doing nothing but hanging out - that's permitted too.

**Everyone votes equally.** The weekly School Meeting governs all aspects of school life. A four-year-old's vote counts the same as a staff member's. They vote on budgets, hiring decisions, rule changes, and disciplinary matters. Children learn democracy by living it, not by reading about it in a textbook.

**Mixed ages interact freely.** Unlike traditional schools that segregate by birth year, Sudbury Valley lets students of all ages mix naturally. Younger children learn from older ones. Older children develop responsibility and leadership by helping younger ones. Everyone benefits from the diversity.

**Staff are resources, not directors.** Adults at the school don't teach in the traditional sense. They're available to help when asked, to share expertise when students seek it, and to maintain safety. They don't initiate instruction or evaluate progress.

## The Trust Problem in Education

Greenberg identified something that most education reformers miss: the fundamental issue is trust.

Traditional schools don't trust children to manage their own time. They don't trust children to know what interests them. They don't trust children to learn without being forced. They don't trust children to make good decisions.

This distrust creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you don't trust someone to think, they learn not to think. When you don't trust someone to choose, they stop choosing. When you control every hour of a child's day for twelve years, you produce adults who wait for instructions.

As one OpenEd newsletter put it, describing [the architecture of distrust](https://opened.co/newsletter/what-happens-when-a-school-actually-trusts-parents) in traditional schooling: "When systems don't trust parents' insights, parents begin doubting themselves. When parents doubt themselves, they stop trusting their instincts about their own children."

Greenberg saw the same pattern with students. Schools that don't trust children produce children who don't trust themselves.

Sudbury Valley inverts the entire premise. Trust children, and they rise to meet that trust. Give them responsibility, and they become responsible. Let them fail, and they learn to recover.

## What the Research Shows

For decades, skeptics asked the obvious question: Do these kids actually learn anything?

Peter Gray, who first encountered Sudbury Valley when his own son enrolled there, decided to find out. He conducted longitudinal research tracking graduates over time.

What he found surprised even him.

"I did a study of the graduates," Gray explained on the [OpenEd podcast](https://opened.co/podcast/every-august-youth-mental-health-crises-spike-every-june-they-plummet-its-not-a-coincidence), "and there were some of the graduates who had never been to a typical school. They had never taken what we would call a school course. They had never taken an exam until maybe they took the SAT exam, which they prepared for. Then they went on to college, they got into college, and they did well in college."

How is this possible? Gray's explanation is simple: "Once they were there, it doesn't honestly surprise me that they can do well. Every class starts pretty much from the beginning anyway. Introductory biology does not assume that you remember any biology from high school."

More importantly, Sudbury graduates arrive at college - if they choose to go - with something traditional students often lack: genuine motivation. They're there because they decided to be, not because the conveyor belt deposited them.

## Four-Year-Olds and Common Sense

One detail about Sudbury Valley surprises parents more than anything else: they accept children starting at age four.

Not as a special preschool program. As full members of the community, with the same freedoms and voting rights as teenagers.

Gray addressed this on the podcast: "The youngest children they will accept is four because they don't believe three-year-olds generally are capable of managing themselves, but four-year-olds are. Even four-year-olds have to have a visiting week to show that they're capable of managing themselves at the school."

This matches what developmental research shows. Around age four, children develop what might be called common sense - the ability to follow rules, remember instructions, and manage themselves in social situations. Hunter-gatherer cultures recognized this transition. Many historical societies gave four-year-olds significant independence and responsibility.

Modern schooling ignores this developmental reality. We keep children in highly controlled environments long past when they're capable of self-management, then wonder why teenagers seem incapable of handling freedom.

## Democracy as Lived Experience

Greenberg believed traditional schools taught children the opposite of democratic values - even when they included civics classes about democracy.

Think about what children actually experience in most schools: Adults make all decisions. Students follow orders. Speaking without permission is punished. Schedules are imposed. Individual preferences don't matter.

Then we hand them a textbook about how democracy works and expect the lesson to stick.

Greenberg's insight was that you can't teach democracy through lectures. Children learn values by living them. A school that operates autocratically produces students comfortable with autocracy, regardless of what the curriculum says.

At Sudbury Valley, democracy happens every day. When a rule needs changing, students propose changes and vote. When someone breaks a rule, a judicial committee of students and staff hears the case. When the school needs to hire new staff, students participate in interviews and decisions.

By the time Sudbury graduates enter adult society, they've spent years practicing citizenship. They know how to argue their position, accept majority decisions, participate in governance, and hold institutions accountable.

## The Model Spreads

Sudbury Valley remained unique for its first two decades. Then other educators started paying attention.

Today, over fifty schools worldwide operate on the Sudbury model. But the influence extends far beyond schools that call themselves Sudbury.

In Georgia, [The Forest School](https://theforest.school/) needed a new building. Instead of hiring architects, they [asked their students](https://opened.co/newsletter/this-school-let-its-students-design-the-campus-137). Elementary kids proposed a central courtyard where three-year-olds and eighteen-year-olds could mingle - the same mixed-age principle Greenberg pioneered in 1968. The student vision was compelling enough to secure a land donation from their town. Kids who are trusted to make real decisions produce ideas worth funding.

The [Alliance for Self-Directed Education](https://www.self-directed.org/), which Peter Gray co-founded, connects families and educators interested in these approaches. [Microschools](https://opened.co/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-microschools-the-educational-trend-growing-faster-than-homeschooling) increasingly incorporate Sudbury principles. Homeschooling families draw on Greenberg's writings to understand what genuine educational freedom might look like.

The model hasn't conquered mainstream education - Greenberg never expected it would. But it has demonstrated, for fifty-five years and counting, that the premise works. Children trusted with freedom don't descend into chaos. They grow into capable, curious, self-directed adults.

## Greenberg's Final Years

Daniel Greenberg never retired. He remained a staff member at Sudbury Valley until days before his death, still showing up, still engaging with students, still writing about education.

He authored or co-authored over twenty books explaining the Sudbury philosophy, including [*Free at Last*](https://www.sudburyvalley.org/product/free-at-last-the-sudbury-valley-school) and *The Sudbury Valley School Experience*. His 2008 book *Turning Learning Right Side Up*, co-written with systems theorist Russell Ackoff, applied his ideas to education reform more broadly.

He died on December 2, 2021, at age 87, after a series of strokes. He left behind his wife Hanna - also a founding staff member - three children, grandchildren, and a school that had shaped thousands of lives.

Peter Gray's tribute captured what made Greenberg matter: "Danny showed us that freedom works in education. Children do not need to be forced to learn. They educate themselves brilliantly when we provide the conditions that allow them to do that. This is no longer a theory; it is proven fact, thanks in great part to Danny and the many others who created Sudbury Valley."

## What Parents Can Take from Greenberg

You don't need to enroll your child in a Sudbury school to apply Greenberg's insights:

**Trust before you verify.** Most parents default to the opposite - verify, then trust. Try assuming your child can handle more responsibility than you currently give them, then see what happens.

**Let them practice democracy at home.** Family meetings where children have real input - not just the illusion of input - teach democratic values better than any civics lesson.

**Stop managing their time.** Greenberg observed that children given control of their own schedules learn to manage time effectively. Children whose every hour is planned for them never develop the skill.

**Accept apparent idleness.** Some of the most important learning at Sudbury Valley looks like doing nothing. Daydreaming, wandering, hanging out with friends - these aren't wastes of time. They're how children process experience and discover interests.

**Ask what interests them.** When [unschooling](https://opened.co/blog/what-is-unschooling) families report that their children learn voraciously, they're describing what Greenberg saw for fifty years: humans are natural learners when you stop interrupting the process.
