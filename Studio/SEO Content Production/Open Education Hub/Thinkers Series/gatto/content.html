<p>When American schoolteacher John Taylor Gatto penned an op-ed in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that announced he didn’t want to “hurt kids to make a living,” it may have alarmed parents everywhere. But Gatto was criticizing the “dumbing down” of students in modern education and revealing the hidden “curriculum” that schools actually teach.</p>

<p>Gatto was not a teacher scorned. On the contrary, he was a three-time New York City Teacher of the Year (1989, 1990, and 1991) and ultimately named New York State Teacher of the Year in 1991—just months before his resignation in his scathing WSJ letter.</p>

<p>"Schooling is a form of adoption," Gatto later said in an interview . "You give your kid away at his most plastic years to a group of strangers."</p>

<p>Although the Columbia University graduate taught for nearly 30 years in New York City public schools, Gatto had a life outside of academia before becoming a respected educator. He drove a cab through New York City streets, wrote advertising copy for Madison Avenue agencies, designed jewelry, and even crafted speeches for political figures including Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.</p>

<p>This wasn't aimless wandering. Each job taught him something about how the "real world" actually worked—the world that schools supposedly prepared children for. He watched how successful people operated, noticed what skills actually mattered, and saw firsthand that credentials often mattered less than curiosity and adaptability.</p>

<p>When Gatto finally entered teaching, he brought these lessons with him. He was anything but conventional: Gatto sent students on independent research projects at public libraries, arranged for shy 13-year-olds to interview legislators at the state capitol, and connected "at-risk" students with real apprenticeships and authentic experiences.</p>

<p>These unorthodox methods earned him major recognition in the educational system, but also led to his observations that compulsory schooling had little to do with academics and everything to do with diminishing children's natural curiosity and potential.</p>

<h2>The Seven Unintended Lessons Schools Really Teach</h2>

<p>The longer Gatto taught, the more he noticed a troubling disconnect between what schools claimed to do and what they actually accomplished. In his New York State Teacher of the Year acceptance speech, Gatto stunned the audience by outlining what he called "The Seven-Lesson Schoolteacher"—the hidden curriculum he believed all institutional schools inevitably teach.</p>

<p>Gatto argued that beyond reading and math, these seven unintended lessons form the true "curriculum" of modern education:</p>

<h3>1. Confusion: Learning Without Context</h3>

<p>"Everything I teach is out of context," Gatto admitted. Schools present information in fragmented, isolated units with few meaningful connections. Classes separate history from literature, math from science, all divided into arbitrary periods marked by bells. The result? Students who can pass tests but struggle to integrate knowledge or apply their learning to real situations.</p>

<h3>2. Class Position: Creating a False Hierarchy</h3>

<p>Schools sort, rank, and label children from their earliest years: gifted, average, remedial. Through countless subtle and not-so-subtle messages, children learn to identify with their assigned category and rarely challenge these boundaries. "I'm not a math person" becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<h3>3. Indifference: No Work Is Worth Finishing</h3>

<p>When the bell rings, students must drop whatever they're doing and move on. This teaches children not to care too deeply about anything. Following your passion gets punished if it doesn't align with the schedule, and the natural excitement of discovery gets replaced by dutiful compliance. As research shows, <a href="https://opened.co/blog/why-kids-lose-their-love-of-learning-and-how-to-prevent-it">many children lose their innate love of learning</a> somewhere between early childhood and adolescence—and it's not by accident.</p>

<h3>4. Emotional Dependency: Seeking External Validation</h3>

<p>"By using stars and red checks, smiles and frowns, prizes and punishments, I force children to become emotionally dependent upon my praise," Gatto confessed. School success depends on pleasing authority figures, making children look outside themselves for validation rather than developing internal standards.</p>

<h3>5. Intellectual Dependency: Waiting to Be Told What to Think</h3>

<p>Original thinking is risky in a system that rewards predictable answers. Gatto noted that "good students wait for a teacher to tell them what to do." They learn to wait for instructions and fail to take initiative. This pattern of <a href="https://opened.co/blog/why-traditional-schools-create-dependent-learners-tyler-thigpen">intellectual dependency created by traditional schooling</a> can persist well into adulthood.</p>

<h3>6. Provisional Self-Esteem: Personal Worth Depends on Performance</h3>

<p>In school, your value is constantly measured, graded, and compared. "They should not trust themselves or their parents," Gatto wrote, "but should instead rely on the evaluation of certified officials." This creates adults whose sense of self rises and falls with each professional evaluation.</p>

<h3>7. You Can't Hide: Constant Surveillance Is Normal</h3>

<p>Students have minimal privacy or autonomy. They're monitored throughout their day, even needing permission for basic bodily functions. This constant oversight teaches children to accept continual surveillance as normal and necessary.</p>

<h2>How the Hidden Curriculum Impacts Children</h2>

<p>These seven lessons affect all children differently. Some students naturally thrive in structured environments, while others—especially those with creative or independent temperaments—can be profoundly affected by the implicit teachings.</p>

<p>"When children are young, you can see the love of learning in their eyes," Gatto observed. "Too often, that light dims with each passing year of schooling."</p>

<p>This doesn't mean teachers are at fault. Most educators enter the profession with genuine dedication. The lessons Gatto identified emerge from the structure and assumptions of the system itself—a system designed in a different era for different purposes.</p>

<h2>Gatto’s Advocacy for Education Reform</h2>

<p>John Taylor Gatto's resignation in 1991 marked the start of his second career.</p>

<p>In 1992, he published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Curriculum-Compulsory-Schooling/dp/0865714487"><em>Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling</em></a>, a collection of essays that became an underground classic among homeschooling families and education reformers. The book crystallized his critique and gave parents language for what they'd sensed but couldn't articulate.</p>

<p>Nearly a decade later, he released his most ambitious work, <a href="https://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/"><em>The Underground History of American Education</em></a> (2001). This sprawling investigation traced how American schooling came to be designed the way it is—who funded it, what purposes it served, and why reform attempts so often fail. He argued that the system wasn't broken; it was working exactly as intended. The full text is available free on his website.</p>

<p>His final major work, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Mass-Instruction-Schoolteachers-Compulsory/dp/0865716692"><em>Weapons of Mass Instruction</em></a> (2008), examined how schooling had become hostile to genius and genuine learning. By then, Gatto had become a sought-after speaker at homeschool conferences and educational freedom events nationwide.</p>

<p>A stroke in 2011 limited his public appearances, but his influence continued to grow. When he died on October 25, 2018, at 82, the homeschool and unschooling communities mourned him as a founding voice of their movement—the teacher who gave them permission to question everything.</p>

<h2>How to Apply Gatto’s Values to Open Education</h2>

<p>Gatto wrote most of his work before the explosion of educational alternatives we see today. He could not have imagined <a href="https://opened.co/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-microschools-the-educational-trend-growing-faster-than-homeschooling">the rise of microschools</a>, learning pods, or education savings accounts that let families design custom learning paths.</p>

<p>But his critique remains foundational. The seven lessons he identified still operate in most institutional settings. Understanding them helps parents recognize when their children are struggling not because of ability, but because of environment.</p>

<p>Open education—the approach of customizing learning to each child rather than fitting each child to a standardized system—is essentially Gatto's vision put into practice.</p>

<h2>What Parents Can Do</h2>

<p>Regardless of where your child learns, you can counterbalance the unintended seven lessons with a few simple shifts in practice and thinking:</p>

<h3>Notice and nurture intrinsic curiosity</h3>

<p>Introduce this type of learning even when it doesn't align with school priorities. Create space for deep dives into topics your child genuinely loves.</p>

<h3>Help your child connect knowledge</h3>

<p>Link school subjects to real-world contexts. Show how history connects to geography connects to economics connects to literature.</p>

<h3>Challenge labels</h3>

<p>Emphasize that reading levels, test scores, and academic rankings are temporary tools, not permanent identities.</p>

<h3>Build internal standards</h3>

<p>Value the process of learning, not just products that can be graded. Help your child develop their own sense of what good work looks like.</p>

<h3>Demonstrate that thinking differently is valuable</h3>

<p>Different perspectives are an advantage, not a problem to fix, so embrace them.</p>

<p>Above all, be your child's advocate. You know them best. Whether they attend public school, private school, or learn at home, your involvement matters.</p>

<h2>Gatto's Lasting Legacy</h2>

<p>John Taylor Gatto's courage in speaking uncomfortable truths opened space for broader conversations about education that continue today. He gave voice to homeschoolers, unschoolers, and those who question the system long before it was mainstream to do so.</p>

<p>His ideas gave permission to millions of parents who sensed something was wrong but couldn't advocate for themselves. Today, homeschoolers, unschoolers, and microschool founders cite Gatto as the teacher who told them they weren't crazy.</p>

<p>As Gatto reminded us: "There isn't a right way to become educated; there are as many ways as fingerprints."</p>
