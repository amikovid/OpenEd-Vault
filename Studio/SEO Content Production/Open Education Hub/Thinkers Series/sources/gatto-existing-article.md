## Strengths (Keep)

- Strong hook with resignation letter quote
- 7 lessons clearly explained
- Good sourcing
- Accessible tone
- Real quotes from Gatto

## Gaps to Fill (Enhancement Opportunities)

### Biography Gaps
- Pre-teaching career mentioned but brief (line 58)
- "taxi driver, jewelry designer, speechwriter" - need more color
- Missing: Columbia education, Harlem teaching context
- Missing: Why he stayed 30 years if he saw problems early

### Post-Career Gaps
- Death mentioned briefly (line 124)
- Missing: Books he wrote after quitting
  - *Dumbing Us Down* (1992)
  - *The Underground History of American Education* (2001)
  - *Weapons of Mass Instruction* (2008)
- Missing: Speaking career, influence on homeschool movement

### Internal Link Gaps
- NO internal links to OpenEd content currently
- Should link to: Unschooling guide, Deschooling newsletter, What is Open Education

### Open Education Connection
- Currently generic ("thoughtful integration")
- Missing: How his critique specifically supports open education thesis
- Missing: What he'd think of microschools, ESAs, etc.

### Technical/SEO Gaps
- URL slug is "5369" - should be "john-taylor-gatto"
- Meta description is empty
- No secondary keyword optimization ("dumbing us down", "underground history")

1. **Expanded biography** - More on pre-teaching life, why it matters
2. **His books** - Mention major works, their impact
3. **Movement connection** - How he influenced homeschool/unschool movement
4. **Internal links** - Add 3+ links to OpenEd content
5. **Technical fixes** - Meta description, suggest URL change
