## Peter Gray Connection (KEY)

Peter Gray is deeply connected to Sudbury Valley:
- Gray's son attended Sudbury Valley (this transformed Gray's views on education)
- Gray described Greenberg as the "principal philosopher" among SVS founders
- Gray conducted longitudinal research on SVS graduates
- Gray wrote tribute "The Man Who Trusted Children" when Greenberg died

### Gray's Research Findings on SVS Graduates
From OpenEd podcast:
- Some graduates never took a formal course until college
- Never took an exam until possibly the SAT
- Got into college and did well
- "Once they were there, it doesn't honestly surprise me that they can do well. Every class starts pretty much from the beginning anyway."

### From Peter Gray Podcast
**On SVS accepting 4-year-olds:**
"I've been very long involved with a radically alternative school called the Sudbury Valley School, where children are not watched. They're free to roam around the campus and in the woods as part of the campus without adults following them. The youngest children they will accept is four because they don't believe three-year-olds generally are capable of managing themselves, but four-year-olds are."

**On structure:**
"Sudbury Valley School, which is a school for self-directed education, is not lacking in structure."

**On graduate outcomes:**
"I did a study of the graduates and there were some of the graduates who had never been to a typical school. They had never taken what we would call a school course. They had never taken an exam until maybe they took the SAT exam, which they prepared for. Then they went on to college, they got into college, and they did well in college."

### From Episode 010 (Isaac)
Story of a 12-13 year old who joined from traditional school - needed time to "deschool" before he could self-direct.

### From Newsletter
"It's on the more radical 'Sudbury Valley' or 'Unschool' end of the spectrum, but it's pretty great in just helping shift mindset."

## Greenberg's Philosophy

### Three Core American Values
Greenberg identified three values unique in combination to the US:
1. Individual rights
2. Political democracy
3. Equal opportunity

His insight: traditional schools violate all three while claiming to prepare children for democratic citizenship.

### On Trust
Peter Gray called his tribute "The Man Who Trusted Children" - trust is the central theme of Greenberg's work.

### Key Quote (from Gray's tribute)
"Danny showed us that freedom works in education. Children do not need to be forced to learn. They educate themselves brilliantly when we provide the conditions that allow them to do that. This is no longer a theory; it is proven fact."
