# Introduction Drafts: Waldorf vs Montessori

Four creative approaches. Each tries to weave in OpenEd expertise while subverting the "vs" premise.

## INTRO 1: "The Heresy"

Here's something that would make purists of both methods cringe:

One of our families uses Oak Meadow - a Waldorf-inspired curriculum heavy on storytelling, nature walks, and watercolor painting. Their kids also spend 30 minutes a day on IXL, a screen-based math program that tracks progress and adjusts difficulty automatically.

Another family does Montessori-style practical life activities every morning - pouring, sorting, food prep. Then in the afternoon, their kids watch educational YouTube videos while mom works.

Neither family is doing it "right" by the standards of Rudolf Steiner or Maria Montessori. Both families are doing exactly what works.

At OpenEd, we've worked with over 20,000 homeschool families. The pattern we see again and again: the families getting the best results aren't loyal to any single method. They're taking what works and leaving what doesn't.

If you're searching "Waldorf vs Montessori" hoping to pick a winner, we have a different suggestion: understand what each approach actually offers, then build something that fits your family.

Here's how.

## INTRO 2: "The Wrong Question"

"So is your homeschool more unschooling or waldorf or classical?"

Courtney Meyerhofer's answer: "Yes."

"Waldorf for culture and arts. Classical for great works and a strong foundation. Unschooling for learning that's rooted in practical life. Every philosophy has a golden nugget. Take it."

If you're comparing Waldorf and Montessori, you've probably noticed most articles treat this like picking a sports team. Commit. Stay loyal. Buy the jersey.

But here's what we've learned from working with thousands of homeschool families: the most successful ones aren't Waldorf families or Montessori families. They're families who understand what each approach does well - and take the pieces that work for their kids.

Keri Mae, who has a degree in early childhood development and spent years teaching kindergarten before joining OpenEd, puts it simply: "I love the Montessori method. It's near and dear to my heart as an early childhood educator, that and Waldorf."

Both. Not one or the other.

This article isn't going to tell you which method wins. Instead, we'll show you what makes each approach genuinely useful - and what parts you might want to skip.

## INTRO 3: "The Uncomfortable Truths"

Let's start with some things nobody tells you about these methods.

**Waldorf:** Rudolf Steiner, the founder, wasn't an educator. He was a philosopher who developed a spiritual system called anthroposophy. Waldorf's famous developmental stages - the idea that children shouldn't read until age 7, that screens damage the "etheric body" - come from his esoteric beliefs, not scientific research. Some of it turns out to be true anyway. Some of it feels dated.

**Montessori:** Maria Montessori was skeptical of fantasy play. She believed children should work with real objects, not pretend ones. If your kid loves playing make-believe, strict Montessori might actually discourage it. And those beautiful wooden materials? The "authentic" ones cost thousands of dollars. There's an entire cottage industry of gatekeeping what counts as "real" Montessori.

Neither method is sacred. Both contain genuine insights. Both contain baggage.

At OpenEd, we've watched families tie themselves in knots trying to be "authentically Waldorf" or "truly Montessori" - often at the expense of what their actual child needs.

Our recommendation? Understand what each approach gets right. Take those pieces. Leave the rest.

Here's what we've learned from working with over 20,000 families.

## INTRO 4: "The Expert's Confession"

Keri Mae has a degree in early childhood development. She taught kindergarten for years. She's read the research on how young children learn. Now she works at OpenEd, supporting thousands of homeschool families.

Her three sons? One is homeschooled. Two attend a Montessori charter school.

"I love the Montessori method," she says. "It's near and dear to my heart as an early childhood educator, that and Waldorf."

Notice she didn't pick one.

When her middle son - who is autistic and has auditory processing issues - started having night terrors about the school bell, Keri Mae went looking for alternatives. She found a Montessori charter school where there are no bells, kids can wear slippers, and transitions happen gently. "All of the problems we had previously were just gone because of the way they ran their school."

Did she choose Montessori because it's philosophically superior to Waldorf? No. She chose it because that particular school solved her son's particular problems.

This is the part most "Waldorf vs Montessori" articles miss: the method matters less than the fit. Both approaches contain real insights about how children learn. Both approaches contain rigid elements that might not work for your family.

The question isn't which method is better. The question is which pieces of each method serve your child.

## Analysis

| Intro | Strength | Risk |
|-------|----------|------|
| **1: Heresy** | Immediately subversive; concrete examples | Might alienate purists (but they're not our audience) |
| **2: Wrong Question** | Courtney quote is punchy; "golden nugget" framework is memorable | Might feel abstract until we get specific |
| **3: Uncomfortable Truths** | Most differentiated; says things competitors won't | Could read as negative/critical |
| **4: Expert's Confession** | Keri Mae grounds it in real expertise; human story | Longer; takes more time to get to the point |

## What's Still Missing?

1. **More specific "takes"** - What does OpenEd actually recommend from each method?
2. **Data or outcomes** - Do we have any evidence that eclectic approaches work?
3. **The "what to take" framework** - After the intro, we need to actually deliver on the promise

## Suggested Combination

Start with Intro 3's "uncomfortable truths" framing (most differentiated), but soften it with Intro 4's Keri Mae story as the second beat. Something like:

> [Uncomfortable truths about both methods]
>
> If this sounds like we're criticizing these approaches, we're not. We're acknowledging that no 100-year-old educational philosophy maps perfectly onto your family in 2026.
>
> Keri Mae, who has a degree in early childhood development and now works with homeschool families at OpenEd, puts it simply: "I love the Montessori method... that and Waldorf." Both. Not one or the other.
>
> This article will show you what each approach genuinely offers - and help you take the pieces that fit.
