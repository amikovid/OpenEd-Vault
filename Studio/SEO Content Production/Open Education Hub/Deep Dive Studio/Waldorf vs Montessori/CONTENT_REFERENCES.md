**Quote - Waldorf + Finland:**
> "The nail in the coffin for Aldeman's analysis comes from Finland—one of the world's highest-performing education systems. They don't even start formal schooling until kids reach the age of seven. Even more striking: Finnish schools achieve better results with shorter school days, less homework, and more play-based learning in early years than American schools. **Waldorf schools report the same pattern: students read later, but once they start, they catch up by fourth grade and often become more engaged readers because they have the maturity to understand what they're reading.**"
