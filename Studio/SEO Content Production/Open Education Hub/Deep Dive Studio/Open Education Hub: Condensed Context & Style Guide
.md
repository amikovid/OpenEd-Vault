# Open Education Hub: Condensed Context & Style Guide
## Our Core Philosophy
**Open Education** is a personalized approach where families design learning around the child—combining resources from schools, online classes, mentors, and real-world experiences.
> "No child is standard. Their education shouldn't be either."
### Key Principles
- **Education serves the child, not the system**
- **Parents are the primary architects**
- **The world is the classroom**
- **Curiosity drives learning**
- **Joyful education works better**
## What Open Education Looks Like
A child might:
- Play volleyball at local public school
- Take math online through Khan Academy
- Join weekly homeschool co-op for science labs
- Work with private tutor for SAT prep
- Take Outschool class on coding Minecraft mods
**This is becoming the norm**, not the exception. Families are "unbundling" education services and rebuilding them in ways that work for their children.
## The OpenEd Method
1. **Discover** → Find what lights your child up
2. **Design** → Mix and match the best resources
3. **Support** → Access educational resources and guidance
4. **Connect** → Join network of families reimagining education
5. **Thrive** → Watch your child grow with confidence and joy

## Our Voice & Style
### Tone
- **Opinionated but helpful** - We tell you what we actually think
- **Clear over comprehensive** - One sentence that captures the core beats ten pages of caveats
- **Strategic clarity** - "Here's how to do X" is less valuable than "X is the wrong thing to do"
- **Uncomfortable truths first** - The thing that's hard to hear is usually what matters
### Content Patterns
- **Start with the problem** - What pain point are we addressing?
- **Provide concrete examples** - Real families, real combinations
- **Include practical resources** - Specific programs, costs, how-to's
- **End with actionable next steps** - What should they do right now?
