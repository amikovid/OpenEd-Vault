Two of the most respected early childhood approaches in the world both came from Italy. Both put the child at the center. Both reject worksheets and rote memorization. Both attract parents who want something different from conventional schooling.

But Montessori and Reggio Emilia work differently in almost every practical way.

Maria Montessori developed her method by observing children and designing specific materials that let them teach themselves. Loris Malaguzzi and the parents of Reggio Emilia, Italy, built a system where children explore their interests through long-term projects, with teachers as co-researchers rather than instructors.

One offers structure through carefully designed materials. The other offers structure through collaborative documentation and emergent curriculum.

Understanding these differences - and what both methods share - can help you decide what fits your child and your family.

## What Is Montessori Education?

Maria Montessori opened her first classroom in 1907 in a Roman tenement, working with children others had dismissed as unteachable. As Italy's first female physician, she approached education as a scientist: observe children carefully, then design environments that support what they naturally want to do.

Her insight was simple but radical. Children are born wanting to learn. Given the right environment and materials, they teach themselves.

The Montessori classroom has distinct features:

**The prepared environment.** Everything has a specific place and purpose. Materials sit on low shelves, accessible to children. Furniture is child-sized. The physical space supports independence from the start.

**Self-correcting materials.** The famous Montessori apparatus - the Pink Tower, the Golden Beads, the Moveable Alphabet - are designed so children discover their own errors. When the puzzle piece doesn't fit, the child knows without being told.

**Mixed-age groupings.** Children stay in the same classroom for three years (typically ages 3-6, 6-9, 9-12). Older children teach younger ones. Younger children learn by watching.

**Following the child.** Teachers observe rather than lecture. When a child is absorbed in counting beads, the teacher doesn't interrupt for group time.

The [American Montessori Society](https://amshq.org/) offers certification programs and school accreditation. For a deeper look at how Montessori works in practice, see our [Montessori Curriculum for Homeschooling](https://opened.co/blog/montessori-curriculum-for-homeschooling) guide.

## What Is Reggio Emilia?

The Reggio Emilia approach emerged from rubble. After World War II ended in 1945, parents in a small Italian town sold an abandoned German tank and some trucks to fund a new kind of school. Loris Malaguzzi, a young teacher, heard about the project and drove out to see it. He stayed for the next fifty years.

What developed in Reggio Emilia was less a method than a philosophy. Malaguzzi believed children express themselves in "a hundred languages" - drawing, sculpture, dramatic play, music, movement, building - and that schools should honor all of them.

The approach has several defining characteristics:

**Emergent curriculum.** There is no predetermined sequence of lessons. Teachers observe children's interests, then design long-term projects that let children explore those interests deeply. A child's fascination with shadows might lead to a weeks-long investigation of light, perspective, and optics.

**The environment as third teacher.** Reggio classrooms are designed as beautiful, inviting spaces that provoke curiosity. Natural light, mirrors, open-ended materials, and displays of children's work create an environment that teaches on its own.

**Documentation as assessment.** Instead of tests or grades, teachers document children's learning through photographs, transcriptions of conversations, and displays of work. These portfolios make children's thinking visible and help teachers plan next steps.

**Collaboration and community.** Learning happens in relationship. Children work together. Teachers work in pairs. Parents are partners in the educational process, not customers being served.

**The hundred languages.** This phrase captures Reggio's central belief: children have many ways of expressing understanding beyond words and numbers. Art, construction, movement, and symbolic play are all legitimate ways of thinking and learning.

Unlike Montessori, there is no official Reggio Emilia certification. The approach spread through publications, study tours to Reggio Emilia, and the [North American Reggio Emilia Alliance](https://reggioalliance.org/). Schools describe themselves as "Reggio-inspired" - they adapt the philosophy to their own context.

## Key Differences

### Curriculum: Predetermined vs. Emergent

This is the fundamental difference.

In Montessori, the curriculum is carefully structured. Children progress through a sequence of materials in each area - practical life, sensorial, language, math, cultural studies. The materials build on each other. A child working with the Binomial Cube at age four is preparing for algebra years later.

In Reggio Emilia, curriculum emerges from children's interests. Teachers document what children are curious about, then design projects around those interests. The curriculum for this group of children this year will look different from last year's, because the children are different.

Both approaches trust children. Montessori trusts them to choose their work from within a prepared range of options. Reggio trusts them to lead the direction of inquiry entirely.

### Materials: Specific vs. Open-Ended

Montessori materials are distinctive and purpose-designed. The Pink Tower has ten pink cubes graduating in size. The Golden Beads represent units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. Each material teaches specific concepts and includes built-in error correction.

Reggio Emilia uses what practitioners call "loose parts" - open-ended materials like fabric, wire, clay, recycled objects, natural items. There's no prescribed set. The same collection of bottle caps might become a math pattern one day and a city map the next.

This affects both cost and philosophy. Authentic Montessori materials are expensive and specific. Reggio materials can come from nature, recycling bins, and hardware stores - but require teachers who know how to see potential in everyday objects.

### Teacher Role: Guide vs. Co-Researcher

The Montessori teacher prepares the environment, presents new materials through individual lessons, and then steps back. The phrase "guide on the side" fits. The teacher observes, redirects when needed, and trusts the materials to do their work.

The Reggio teacher is more actively involved in learning - but not as an instructor. Teachers act as co-researchers, wondering alongside children, asking questions, proposing challenges. They document extensively, using children's words and work to understand and extend their thinking.

In Montessori, the materials mediate learning. In Reggio, relationships do.

### Assessment: Progress vs. Documentation

Montessori assessment is built into the materials. Teachers track which works children have received lessons on and mastered. Progress through the curriculum is visible - the child who has moved from the Binomial to the Trinomial Cube has demonstrated growth.

Reggio assessment happens through documentation. Teachers collect photographs, transcriptions of children's conversations, and samples of work over time. These materials are displayed, shared with families, and used to plan future learning. The documentation itself becomes a tool for reflection.

### Standardization: Certified vs. Inspired

Montessori has established training programs and certification bodies - [AMI](https://montessori-ami.org/) (Association Montessori Internationale) and [AMS](https://amshq.org/) (American Montessori Society) are the main ones. Schools can be accredited. Teachers have recognized credentials.

Reggio Emilia has no trademark or certification system. Schools can call themselves "Reggio-inspired" without meeting any official standard. This means quality varies more widely, but it also means the approach can adapt flexibly to different contexts.

## What Both Get Right

Despite their differences, Montessori and Reggio Emilia share principles that set them apart from conventional early childhood education:

**Child-led learning.** Both reject the idea that adults should control every moment of a child's day. Children have agency - in Montessori through choice of work, in Reggio through direction of projects.

**Respect for the child.** Both emerged from the belief that children are capable, intelligent people - not empty vessels waiting to be filled. This respect shapes everything from the physical environment to how teachers speak with children.

**Rich environments.** Both invest seriously in the spaces where children learn. Neither approach relies on worksheets, screens, or mass-produced materials. The environment matters.

**Against rote memorization.** Neither method values recitation or drill. Learning happens through experience, manipulation, and discovery.

**Italian origins.** Both emerged from Italian culture's high regard for aesthetics, childhood, and community - though Montessori has spread globally while Reggio remains closely tied to its birthplace.

## Which Approach Fits Your Child?

**If your child is independent and self-paced:** Montessori's prepared environment and self-correcting materials allow children to work at their own speed without waiting for others or being pushed ahead too quickly.

**If your child is social and collaborative:** Reggio's project-based approach centers on group investigation and community. Children learn together, building on each other's ideas.

**If your child needs clear structure:** Montessori provides visible progression through defined materials. The sequence gives both child and parent a sense of direction.

**If your child is artistic and expressive:** Reggio's "hundred languages" philosophy honors many ways of knowing. Drawing, building, dramatic play, and music are central to learning - not extras.

**If your child is concrete and tactile:** Montessori's hands-on materials make abstract concepts physical. Math becomes something you can hold.

**If your child is fascinated by deep questions:** Reggio's emergent projects allow extended investigation. A child's interest can be explored for weeks or months, not moved past in a lesson.

For children with attention differences, both approaches offer advantages over conventional classrooms. Our guide to [homeschooling a child with ADHD](https://opened.co/blog/homeschooling-a-child-with-adhd) notes that "the more your student can touch, build, move, and do, the better." Both Montessori and Reggio meet that standard - the specific fit depends on whether your child does better with structured choices or open exploration.

## Combining Approaches

Many families and schools take elements from both. The philosophies share enough common ground that hybrid approaches work well.

**Montessori materials with Reggio documentation.** Use the structured materials for math and language development, but document learning Reggio-style - collecting photographs, transcribing children's thinking, making learning visible.

**Reggio projects with Montessori practical life.** Let children's interests drive extended investigations, but include Montessori's approach to cooking, cleaning, and care of the environment. Independence skills don't need to emerge from projects.

**Morning structure, afternoon emergence.** Some programs use Montessori's work cycle in the morning when focus is highest, then shift to Reggio-style exploration and project work in the afternoon.

**Environment from both.** Montessori's prepared shelves with specific materials can coexist with Reggio's open-ended loose parts and beautiful natural light. The combination gives children both structured and unstructured options.

Our piece on [Waldorf vs Montessori](https://opened.co/blog/waldorf-vs-montessori) explores similar territory - how alternative approaches can complement each other rather than compete. The category matters less than the fit.

At OpenEd, we see this pattern repeatedly: families who understand what each approach offers - and take the pieces that work - get better results than those trying to follow any system perfectly. [Open education](https://opened.co/blog/what-is-open-education) is built on this principle: observe your child, adapt what works, stay curious.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Reggio Emilia a curriculum?**

Not in the traditional sense. Reggio Emilia is a philosophy and approach to early childhood education, not a prescribed curriculum. There are no specific materials to purchase or sequences to follow. Schools that call themselves "Reggio-inspired" are adapting the philosophy to their own context. This flexibility is intentional - but it means quality varies more than with certified Montessori programs.

**Which is better for ADHD?**

Both can work well. Montessori's freedom of movement, hands-on materials, and self-paced work help many children with ADHD. Reggio's project-based learning and multiple modes of expression can engage children who struggle with traditional instruction. The specific environment and teacher matter more than the label. Visit programs, observe how they handle high-energy children, and trust what you see.

**Are there Reggio Emilia schools in the United States?**

Yes, hundreds of programs across the country describe themselves as "Reggio-inspired." Because there's no certification system, schools interpret the approach differently. The [North American Reggio Emilia Alliance](https://reggioalliance.org/) offers resources and professional development, but doesn't accredit schools. Ask programs what Reggio-inspired means to them in practice - particularly around documentation, emergent curriculum, and the arts.

**Can you do Reggio Emilia at home?**

The core principles translate to home settings: follow children's interests, document their learning, provide open-ended materials, honor many forms of expression. The collaborative element is harder - Reggio was designed around community. Homeschool groups, co-ops, and regular time with other children can help. Start with documentation: photograph your child's work, write down what they say about it, and use those observations to plan what comes next.

**What is the "hundred languages" concept?**

This phrase - from a poem by Loris Malaguzzi - captures Reggio's belief that children have many ways of expressing understanding beyond words and numbers. Drawing, painting, sculpture, building, movement, music, dramatic play - all are valid "languages" for thinking and learning. Traditional schooling, Malaguzzi argued, steals these languages, insisting children express themselves only through reading, writing, and computation. Reggio aims to honor the full range of how children make sense of the world.
