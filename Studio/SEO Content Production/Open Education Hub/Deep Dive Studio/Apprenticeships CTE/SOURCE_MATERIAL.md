## SECTION 1: The Problem with "College for All"

### Michelle Rhee - The Skills Gap Reality
> "Even back in 2007, employers were saying they couldn't find the skilled workers they needed. I used that as a rallying cry in public education. Decades later, they were still saying the same thing."

> "Reformers, myself included, over-indexed on 'college for all.' We saw students from high-performing charters succeed academically, then take on debt, fail to graduate, or graduate without good prospects."

### Michael Horn - The System is Broken
> "It's actually really hard to create change in K-12 because it's somewhat of a dependent system on higher ed. We think of good high schools as that which gets its students into quote unquote good colleges. But if colleges are misfiring, then the whole system behind it misfires as well."

> "Taking on a lot of debt when your success rate is six out of ten. If you're low income, by the way, it's closer to one out of ten... if you do graduate, 50% of those people get a job that doesn't require the degree, and then 90% of those people are stuck in a job five years later that still doesn't require a degree."

### Mike Rowe - The Reality Check
> "We're lending money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back to train them for jobs that no longer exist."

> "The most critical jobs that allow civilized life to happen are the exact jobs right now that are struggling to recruit."

## SECTION 2: Why Apprenticeships Work

### Michelle Rhee - Learn by Doing
> "This notion that you're gonna go to college for four years and learn, learn, learn, and then you're gonna go do - was just so outdated. So antiquated for the way that young people think."

> "We have to have young people in these jobs actually doing, and as educators, we know that this is the best way that people learn. It's not just reading books, but actually doing things."

> "Once employers sort of realized like, oh, yeah, I mean this, all of our entry level payroll specialists - we have to train them for a certain amount of time - and we're like, right. That's essentially an apprenticeship."

### Michael Horn - De-Risking the Path
> "The notion of an apprenticeship where you can get paid while you're learning all of a sudden takes off that risk."

> "For most companies, they need to find ways to de-risk this as well. Because they know talent only stays in the job for four years. There's a lot of movement. They don't wanna be training the person that someone else is gonna free ride off of."

### Isaac Morehouse - The Praxis Model
> "I started an apprenticeship program that was an alternative to college. Hey, come spend six months, we'll give you a bootcamp and then we'll place you in and someone will pay you for six months to work. With the knowledge that you don't quite know everything yet, but you're inexpensive."

> "Entry level talent at intern level prices - so for the employer, it's like, Hey, don't worry. We're giving them additional support and helping them."

## SECTION 3: The Emerging Jobs Landscape

### Michelle Rhee - Jobs That Didn't Exist
> "When we lived in a pricey L.A. apartment building, everyone was half our age. My husband asked what they did: cannabis, crypto, gaming, content creation - roles that didn't exist ten years earlier, with no standard college pathway."

> "Now there are so many different kinds of opportunities out there that were not even dreamed of a few years ago. And I don't think young people are clear on, okay, what are they, how can I prepare myself for them?"

### Michael Horn - Non-Linear Careers
> "People change jobs every four years on average. A billion people switch jobs worldwide every single year. It's not linear - they're not like, okay, I'm coming in as the entry level employee. I'm an individual contributor. Now I wanna be a manager then a director. No, it swirls. It loops. People have a couple side hustles."

## SECTION 4: Skilled Trades & CTE

### Mike Rowe - AI-Proof Careers
> "AI is coming for the coders. They're not coming for the welders. They're not coming for the electricians."

> "If all the CTE people call in sick for a week, you're going to have a problem."

### The Numbers (from Mike Rowe article):
- U.S. will need **500,000 electricians** in the next few years
- **BlueForge Alliance** needs **140,000 skilled tradespeople** to build nuclear submarines
- Auto repair industry short **80,000 collision repair technicians**
- Over **10 million jobs** remained unfilled as of February 2024

### Mike Rowe - Changing Perceptions
> "We need to change the way the country feels about work. To make work cool again."

## SECTION 5: Practical Advice for Parents

### The Three Pillars (Michael Horn)
> "There's the three legs: exposure, actually doing the work, and meeting real people who do the work and building up networks in different places. Because at the end of the day, that's also how we get jobs - through who you know."

### Isaac Morehouse - Start Simple
> "Don't look at the whole humongous problem. Just start with the lowest hanging fruit. Is there something that I don't hate that seems somewhat interesting that someone would let me do, or shadow them while they do?"

> "If your kid's interested in something, can you find a bakery and say, would they be able to come in and just like shadow? What if they wash dishes? They may say no, but just try to find some step that lets them get a little bit higher degree of exposure."

### Michael Horn - Solve Today's Problem
> "Let's solve the current problem as opposed to the problem five years from now."

> "If you're homeschooling, the academics are taking what, a couple hours a day? You have a lot of time and flexibility to plug into different organizations."

### Michelle Rhee - Durable Skills Matter
> "Don't underestimate the power and the value of just general skills - what people call soft skills, durable skills. My daughters sat through too many car rides where I was on speaker phone having a performance evaluation, hiring somebody, firing somebody, negotiating a contract. They would be in back listening to all of that stuff."

> "I paid both of them before they graduated from high school to work in a service job. You go scoop ice cream, flip hamburgers. You have to have that experience of dealing with an unhappy customer."

### Isaac Morehouse - Let Them Try
> "Let them help - even if it's slower and messier. If you always say, 'I'll do it,' they never build the 'I can try this' muscle."

> "It was too easy for me to just be impatient and say, no, you just watch. Let me handle it."

### Michelle Rhee - Building Confidence Through Reps
> "It's about getting the reps in. If you watch something enough times or hear something enough times, you gain confidence. Then young people are gonna be like, okay, I've seen it. I have some pattern recognition now. I can do this."

## SECTION 6: Final Takeaways

### Isaac Morehouse - First Dollar on the Fridge
> "What if them getting someone other than family to pay them their first dollar for something, for anything, was treated with the same level of pride as a great report card? A restaurant hangs that first dollar on the wall. You got somebody to pay you a dollar for some value you created for them."

### Michelle Rhee - Let Kids Do Hard Things
> "When we do everything for our kids as parents, we do a disservice to them. The research is very clear that kids who have to go through hard things and figure it out - there is actually a lot of friction in their lives that they have to muster their way through - are much more successful in the long run. Letting go of all that working parent guilt stuff and letting your kids do hard stuff."

### Michael Horn - Embrace Experimentation
> "Lots of sprints, lots of exposure, lots of opportunities to build... This is less about finding the thing and more about learning and also crossing things off the list."
