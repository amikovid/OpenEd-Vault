<p>Michelle Rhee spent two decades as one of education reform's most prominent voices. As the Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, she championed rigorous academics, high test scores, and the four-year degree as the pathway to success.</p>

<p>Then she moved to a high-end apartment building in downtown Los Angeles. Her neighbors - all in their 20s - were out-earning her. Their jobs? Cannabis retail, crypto trading, and content creation. None of them had majored in any of it. Some hadn't finished college at all.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://opened.co/blog/college-for-all-is-breaking-what-replaces-it">playbook has fundamentally changed</a>. The rigid path Rhee had spent her career defending was being bypassed by a new reality: hands-on experience, marketable skills, and the rise of the modern apprenticeship.</p>

<h2><strong>The Crack in "College for All"</strong></h2>

<p>For decades, the path seemed obvious: good grades, SAT prep, four-year degree, career. Parents stuck to the formula because it worked - for them. Guidance counselors repeated it. Politicians campaigned on it. By 2010, "college for all" had become educational orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The numbers told a different story.</p>

<p>According to research by <a href="https://opened.co/blog/college-for-all-is-breaking-what-replaces-it">Michael Horn</a>, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Job-Moves-Strategies-Meaningful-Advancement/dp/0063135531"><em>Job Moves</em></a> and a longtime education researcher, college success rates are worse than most parents realize. "Taking on a lot of debt when your success rate is six out of ten," Horn notes. "If you're low income, it's closer to one out of ten. And if you do graduate, 50% of those people get a job that doesn't require the degree. Then 90% of those people are stuck in a job five years later that still doesn't require a degree."</p>

<p>Read that again: <em>half of all college graduates work jobs that don't need their diploma. Most stay stuck there.</em></p>

<p>The data suggests a massive disconnect in preparation; <a href="https://opened.co/blog/skills-over-degrees-the-new-career-reality">77% of graduates report they learned more in their first six months on the job than in their entire four-year degree</a>, while 81% of employers now say they prioritize proven skills over traditional credentials.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports over 10 million unfilled jobs - many in skilled trades and technical fields. Plumbers, electricians, machinists, and healthcare technicians are in desperate demand. Employers can't find workers.</p>

<p><a href="https://opened.co/blog/mike-rowes-case-for-career-and-technical-education">Mike Rowe</a>, the <em>Dirty Jobs</em> host who's spent two decades advocating for skilled trades, puts it bluntly: "We're lending money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back to train them for jobs that no longer exist."</p>

<p>The disconnect is staggering. Millions of young people are drowning in debt for degrees that don't help them. Millions of well-paying jobs are sitting empty. Something has to give.</p>

<p>As Rowe often argues, we have a "priorities crisis" rather than just a skills gap. We need to <a href="https://opened.co/blog/mike-rowes-case-for-career-and-technical-education">change the national perception of vocational work</a> and "make work cool again" by celebrating the essential skills that keep modern civilization functioning.</p>

<h2><strong>What Are Apprenticeships and CTE?</strong></h2>

<p>These aren't your parents' shop classes.</p>

<p><strong>Apprenticeships</strong> are earn-while-you-learn programs. A teen or young adult joins a company, gets paid from day one, and learns the job through hands-on work and structured training. They might earn $15-25 an hour while building real skills and professional networks. At the end - typically one to four years - they have credentials, experience, and often a full-time job offer.</p>

<p><strong>CTE (Career and Technical Education)</strong> - also called vocational training - refers to high school and post-secondary programs teaching specific trades and technical skills. Modern CTE covers far more than welding and auto shop. Programs cover a range of fields:</p>

<ul><li>robotics and advanced manufacturing</li><li>healthcare technology and nursing</li><li>cybersecurity and IT</li><li>digital media production</li><li>construction management</li><li>HVAC and electrical systems</li></ul>

<p>Many CTE programs partner with local community colleges, offering dual enrollment credits. Some lead directly to industry certifications that employers actually value.</p>

<p>"If all the CTE people call in sick for a week, you're going to have a problem," Rowe said at a SkillsUSA conference. He wasn't joking. Toilets flush because of CTE graduates. Lights turn on because of CTE graduates. The internet works because of CTE graduates.</p>

<p>Yet most high schoolers have never heard the term.</p>

<h2><strong>The AI Question: Which Careers Are Actually Secure?</strong></h2>

<p>Every conversation about career prep in 2025 includes AI. The answer to whether machines will take your teen's future job depends entirely on which job you're talking about.</p>

<p>"AI is coming for the coders," Rowe observes. "They're not coming for the welders. They're not coming for the electricians."</p>

<p>The trades have a structural advantage: physical work can't be done by software. A robot can't snake a clogged drain at 2 AM. An algorithm can't rewire a house. These jobs require presence, judgment, and hands - things AI doesn't have.</p>

<p>This labor shortage has created a massive opportunity for <a href="https://opened.co/blog/why-the-trades-pay-6-figures">"Blue Collar Arbitrage"</a> — because for every five tradespeople who retire today, only two are entering the workforce, driving wages for essential roles like welding and electrical work into the six-figure range.</p>

<p>The numbers reflect this:</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. will need <strong>500,000 electricians</strong> in the next few years.</li><li>The <strong>BlueForge Alliance</strong> needs <strong>140,000 skilled tradespeople</strong> to build nuclear submarines.</li><li>The auto repair industry is short <strong>80,000 collision repair technicians.</strong></li></ul>

  </div>
</figure>

<p>These aren't low-wage dead-ends. Skilled trades increasingly offer six-figure potential, union benefits, and genuine job security. The catch? Not enough young people are entering them.</p>

<p>"The most critical jobs that allow civilized life to happen are the exact jobs struggling to recruit," Rowe says. "We've created a cultural disconnect between the work we need and the careers we celebrate."</p>

<h2><strong>How Apprenticeships Actually Work</strong></h2>

<p>The model is simpler than most people think.</p>

<p>A young person joins a company or trade program. They get paid - not much at first, but real money. They work alongside experienced professionals, learning through doing. Along the way, they earn certifications or credentials that translate to higher wages and more responsibility.</p>

<p>Michelle Rhee saw this pattern when she moved into workforce development. Her company, BuildWithin, helps employers create apprenticeship programs. The hardest part? Convincing companies they were already doing something similar.</p>

<p>"Once employers realized - oh yeah, all of our entry level payroll specialists, we have to train them for a certain amount of time - and we're like, right. That's essentially an apprenticeship," <a href="https://opened.co/blog/what-to-do-when-your-students-dont-respect-you-michelle-rhees-story">Rhee explains</a>. Every entry-level job involves on-the-job learning. Apprenticeships just formalize the process.</p>

<p>Isaac Morehouse, CEO of OpenEd and founder of the business apprenticeship program <a href="https://discoverpraxis.com/">Praxis</a>, calls it "entry level talent at intern level prices." The employer gets eager workers at reasonable cost. The apprentice gets real experience and income.</p>

<p>There are several flavors of apprenticeship:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Registered Apprenticeships</strong> are government-certified programs, typically in trades. They follow Department of Labor guidelines and lead to nationally recognized credentials.</li><li><strong>Business Apprenticeships</strong> place young adults in startups and growing companies. Programs like Praxis match participants with marketing, operations, and customer success roles.</li><li><strong>Youth Apprenticeships</strong> let high schoolers work part-time while still in school. These bridge the gap between classroom and career.</li><li><strong>Pre-Apprenticeships</strong> are shorter programs - often just a few weeks - that prepare participants for full apprenticeship placement.</li></ul>

<p>Regardless of the flavor, the <strong>secret sauce</strong> is the same: learning by doing, earning while learning, and building a resume that actually carries weight.</p>

<h2><strong>CTE and Vocational Training Pathways for Homeschool Families</strong></h2>

<p>Homeschoolers have more flexibility than they often realize when it comes to vocational training.</p>

<p><strong>Community college dual enrollment</strong> lets teens take technical courses for credit while completing their homeschool education. Many families use this for welding, nursing prerequisites, IT certifications, and construction trades. OpenEd can support tuition costs for secular programs.</p>

<p><strong>Public school CTE programs</strong> often accept part-time students. Even if you're homeschooling, your teen might attend the local high school for specific technical courses. Call your district and ask.</p>

<p><strong>Online certifications</strong> offer another path. <a href="https://knowledge-pillars.com/">Knowledge Pillars</a>, an OpenEd partner, provides browser-based tech certification exams - real assessments using actual tools like WordPress, Python, and JavaScript. These credentials signal competence to employers in ways transcripts can't.</p>

<p><strong>Trade unions</strong> frequently run youth programs and pre-apprenticeships. Electricians, plumbers, and sheet metal workers all have training pipelines designed to bring in young talent.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual reality training</strong> is an emerging option. Companies now offer VR-based simulations for welding, machining, and other trades - low-risk practice before touching real equipment.</p>

<p>What OpenEd can support OpenEd can support a number of these programs:</p>

<ul><li>Secular CTE courses and certifications</li><li>Dual enrollment tuition</li><li>Tutoring in technical subjects</li><li>Equipment and supplies for hands-on learning</li><li>Field trips to manufacturing facilities</li></ul>

<p><s>What we can't support: religious curricula or programs with sectarian requirements.</s> We can't provide assistance for programs based on religious curricula, sectarian requirements, or other deeply held personal beliefs.</p>

<h2><strong>Practical Steps for Parents</strong></h2>

<p>Michael Horn <a href="https://opened.co/blog/college-for-all-is-breaking-what-replaces-it">boils career preparation down to three pillars</a>: exposure, doing, and networks.</p>

<p><strong>Exposure</strong> means letting kids see real work happen. They can't aspire to jobs they don't know exist.</p>

<p><strong>Doing</strong> means hands-on attempts - even messy, slow, failure-prone attempts. As career expert <a href="https://opened.co/blog/7-things-career-expert-ken-coleman-says-parents-get-wrong-and-how-to-fix-them">Ken Coleman notes</a>, this is the time to identify a child's "natural edges" rather than forcing them to be well-rounded. The world rewards specialists, so parents should focus on sharpening a teen's natural talents into "nines and tens" rather than wasting effort trying to turn a weakness into a mediocre "five".</p>

<p><strong>Networks</strong> means connecting them to people who actually do the work. As Horn notes, most jobs still come through personal connections, especially in an age where AI is writing applications and filters are screening them out.</p>

<p>"Don't look at the whole humongous problem," says Isaac Morehouse. "Just start with the lowest hanging fruit. Is there something that I don't hate that seems somewhat interesting that someone would let me do, or shadow them while they do?"</p>

<p>Here's how that looks at different ages:</p>

<h3><strong>For Younger Kids (8-12)</strong></h3>

<p>Let them watch you work. If you're on speakerphone calls, let them listen. If you're answering emails, explain what you're doing. Michelle Rhee's daughters "sat through too many car rides where I was on speaker phone having a performance evaluation, hiring somebody, firing somebody, negotiating a contract." Those rides taught them skills no curriculum could.</p>

<p>Include them in household "jobs" - not just chores, but projects that require problem-solving. Building a deck. Fixing a leak. Planning a family trip.</p>

<p>Find local businesses willing to let a kid shadow. The bakery. The veterinarian. The auto shop. Many will say no. Some will say yes.</p>

<h3><strong>For Tweens (12-14)</strong></h3>

<p>Service jobs build durable skills. Rhee required both her daughters to work service jobs before graduating high school. "You go scoop ice cream, flip hamburgers. You have to have that experience of dealing with an unhappy customer."</p>

<p>Volunteer positions with hands-on components - animal shelters, community gardens, Habitat for Humanity - give teens real responsibility.</p>

<p>Summer programs at makerspaces and hackerspaces let them experiment with tools, code, and creative projects alongside mentors.</p>

<h3><strong>For Teens (14-18)</strong></h3>

<p>This is when formal pathways open up. Apply to youth apprenticeship programs. Enroll in dual credit technical courses. Find part-time work in target industries - even if it's sweeping floors, you're learning how the business operates. To evaluate these early roles, families can use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Get-Clear-Career-Assessment-Youre/dp/B0CSCY1CH5">Coleman's "three wires" framework</a>: <strong>Talent</strong> (what they do best), <strong>Passion</strong> (what they love), and <strong>Mission</strong> (the results they care about). This ensures the "doing" phase aligns with the work they are actually wired to perform.</p>

<p>SkillsUSA runs national competitions in dozens of technical fields. Participating sharpens skills and connects students to recruiters.</p>

<h3><strong>The "First Dollar on the Fridge"</strong></h3>

<p>Morehouse offers a simple reframe: "What if them getting someone other than family to pay them their first dollar for something was treated with the same level of pride as a great report card? A restaurant hangs that first dollar on the wall. You got somebody to pay you a dollar for some value you created for them."</p>

<p>That first transaction - getting paid for value you created - is a milestone worth celebrating. Hang it on the fridge.</p>

<h3><strong>Let Them Struggle</strong></h3>

<p>Rhee's final advice cuts against parental instinct: "When we do everything for our kids as parents, we do a disservice to them. The research is very clear that kids who have to go through hard things and figure it out - there is actually a lot of friction in their lives that they have to muster their way through - are much more successful in the long run."</p>

<p>Let them fail. Let them figure it out. Let them do hard things.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Are apprenticeships only for trades?</strong></p>

<p>No. Modern apprenticeships cover IT, healthcare, business, finance, and creative fields. Praxis places young adults in marketing, operations, and startup roles. Large tech companies run software engineering apprenticeships.</p>

<p><strong>What's the minimum age for apprenticeships?</strong></p>

<p>Varies by program. Youth apprenticeships can start at 16\. Most formal registered programs accept participants ages 18+. Pre-apprenticeships and CTE courses begin earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Will my teen miss out on the "college experience"?</strong></p>

<p>They'll gain a different experience - professional networks, real income, actual skills. Many report greater maturity and direction than peers who went the traditional route.</p>

<p><strong>Can they still go to college later?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely. Many trades pay well enough that teens can save for college - and attend debt-free. Some apprenticeship programs include transferable college credits.</p>

<p><strong>How do I find apprenticeships near me?</strong></p>

<p>Start with <a href="https://www.apprenticeship.gov/">Apprenticeship.gov</a> - the federal database organized by state and occupation. Local trade unions maintain their own programs. Community colleges often partner with employers. And direct outreach works: email businesses in your area and ask if they'd consider a motivated young learner.</p>

<p><strong>What if my teen doesn't know what they want to do?</strong></p>

<p>Perfect. Apprenticeships are low-risk experiments. Try something for 6-12 months. If it doesn't fit, you've learned something and earned money while doing it. That's a better outcome than $30K of debt in the wrong major.</p>

<p><strong>What trades pay $100K or more?</strong></p>

<p>Electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, elevator mechanics, and commercial divers regularly hit six figures. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows median pay for elevator installers at $102K. Welders in specialized fields - underwater welding, pipeline work - often exceed $100K. The key factors are specialization, geographic flexibility, and willingness to work nontraditional hours.</p>

<p><strong>What are easy trades to learn that pay well?</strong></p>

<p>"Easy" depends on your strengths. HVAC technicians can complete training in 6-12 months and earn $50K+ quickly. Truck driving requires just weeks of training with immediate job placement. Dental hygiene takes two years but averages $80K. The trades with the fastest path to good income typically involve physical work, irregular hours, or both - which is exactly why they pay well and have openings.</p>

<p>Remember the young people in Michelle Rhee's apartment building? They weren't following anyone's script. They found work that didn't exist when their parents were young. They built skills by doing, not by sitting in classrooms.</p>

<p>The question isn't college vs. no college. It's: what does your teen actually need to build a good life?</p>

<p>For many, the answer is hands-on learning, real income, and practical skills - not four more years in a classroom taking notes.</p>

<p>"Let your kids do hard things," Rhee says. "Don't smooth every road out of guilt. Friction builds capacity - and success."</p>
