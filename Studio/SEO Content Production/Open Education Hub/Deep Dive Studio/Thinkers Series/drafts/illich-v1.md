## ARTICLE

# Ivan Illich: The Priest Who Said Abolish Schools

In 1971, a renegade Catholic priest published a slim book with a radical argument: schools were beyond saving. Don't reform them. Abolish them.

Ivan Illich's [*Deschooling Society*](https://archive.org/details/deschoolingsocie0000illi) landed like a bomb in educational circles. While others debated class sizes and curriculum standards, Illich argued the entire premise was flawed. The institution itself - compulsory, graded, credential-dispensing - couldn't be fixed because the structure was the problem.

"Even most intentional learning," Illich wrote, "is not the result of programmed instruction."

Fifty years later, his ideas sound less radical and more prophetic. The explosion of homeschooling, microschools, and self-directed learning has proven his central claim: meaningful education happens outside institutions as often as inside them.

## From Vienna to the Bronx

Ivan Illich's path to educational heresy started in Vienna in 1926. His family fled to Italy to escape Nazi persecution. He earned a Ph.D. in history, was ordained a Catholic priest in 1951, and arrived in New York to serve a Puerto Rican parish in the Bronx.

There, something unusual happened. Instead of assimilating his parishioners into American culture - the standard approach - Illich encouraged them to retain their language and traditions. He saw institutions demanding conformity and asked why.

By 1956, he was vice-rector of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico. By 1959, at just 33, he was made a Monsignor. His career in the Church seemed assured.

But Illich kept asking inconvenient questions. He criticized the Church's institutional expansion in Latin America. He questioned whether missionaries were spreading faith or American capitalism dressed in religious clothing. Eventually, Rome forced him out.

A priest who questioned the Church. A scholar who questioned academia. The pattern was set.

## The Deschooling Argument

Illich didn't write *Deschooling Society* for homeschoolers - the modern movement barely existed in 1971. He wrote it for society at large, arguing that our dependence on schools had become a kind of collective addiction.

His critique had three layers:

**Schools confuse process with substance.** Students learn to equate sitting in class with learning, grades with knowledge, credentials with competence. A diploma becomes proof of education even when the graduate has learned nothing useful.

**Schools create artificial scarcity.** By requiring credentials for basic jobs, schools manufacture demand for their own services. You need a degree not because the job requires that knowledge, but because other applicants have degrees.

**Schools teach hidden lessons.** Beyond any curriculum, students absorb a deeper message: wait for instruction, defer to authority, accept that experts know best about your own life. The structure teaches dependence even when the content teaches independence.

These observations echoed what [John Taylor Gatto would later call the "seven lessons"](https://opened.co/blog/john-taylor-gatto) every school really teaches - confusion, class position, indifference, emotional dependency, intellectual dependency, provisional self-esteem, and constant surveillance. Gatto discovered it from inside the classroom. Illich saw it from outside.

## Learning Webs: Education After School

Illich didn't just critique. He proposed an alternative that sounds remarkably like what technology has since made possible.

He called them "learning webs" - networks that would match people who want to learn with people who want to teach, connect learners with shared interests, and provide access to educational resources without gatekeepers.

A functional educational system, Illich argued, should do three things:

1. **Provide access to resources** - Give everyone who wants to learn access to available resources at any time in their lives
2. **Connect teachers and learners** - Help anyone who wants to share knowledge find those who want to learn it
3. **Enable public discourse** - Give anyone who wants to present an issue the opportunity to make their challenge known

In 1971, this sounded utopian. Today, it sounds like the internet - or at least the internet's promise. YouTube tutorials. Skill-sharing platforms. Homeschool co-ops. [Microschools that form around specific interests and dissolve when they've served their purpose.](https://opened.co/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-microschools-the-educational-trend-growing-faster-than-homeschooling)

Illich didn't predict the technology. He predicted the need.

## Why He Still Matters

Illich wrote about schools, but his deeper concern was what he called "institutionalization" - the way modern life hands over basic human capacities to professional systems. Schools teach us that learning requires teachers. Hospitals teach us that healing requires doctors. The legal system teaches us that justice requires lawyers.

Each institution starts with good intentions and ends by creating dependence. We forget that humans learned, healed, and resolved disputes for millennia without these structures.

This is Illich's lasting insight, and it speaks directly to families choosing alternative education today. The question isn't whether your child is getting a "proper" education. The question is whether your child is developing the capacity to learn without being taught - to seek knowledge rather than wait for it to be delivered.

Open education - [the approach of customizing learning to each child's interests and pace](https://opened.co/blog/why-kids-lose-their-love-of-learning-and-how-to-prevent-it) rather than fitting children to a standardized system - is Illich's vision made practical. When a homeschooling parent lets their child spend three hours building with LEGOs instead of worksheets, they're practicing deschooling whether they know the term or not.

## The Difference Between Deschooling and Unschooling

The terms get confused, but they're distinct.

**Deschooling** is what Illich wrote about: a societal shift away from dependence on schools as the primary means of education. It's a big-picture critique of institutions.

**Unschooling** is what John Holt developed around the same time: a family-level approach that lets children pursue their interests and learn through real-life experiences. Parents act as guides, not teachers.

As one educator put it, "Deschooling is the big-picture relative always talking about changing the world, while unschooling is the cool aunt who lets you build rocket ships in the backyard."

Both challenge traditional education. Both emphasize self-directed learning. But deschooling is a diagnosis of society's problem. Unschooling is one family's solution.

## What Parents Can Take from Illich

You don't have to abolish schools to apply Illich's insights. Here's what his critique suggests for any family:

**Watch for process confusion.** When your child says "I learned that" after sitting through a lecture, ask what they actually remember. Attendance isn't absorption.

**Question credential requirements.** Before assuming your child needs a particular degree or certification, ask whether the actual job requires that knowledge or just that piece of paper.

**Notice the hidden curriculum.** What is your child's learning environment teaching implicitly? That authority figures have answers? That questions should wait for appropriate times? That learning happens in specific places on specific schedules?

**Build their learning network.** Who can your child learn from besides professional teachers? Grandparents, neighbors, YouTube creators, librarians, local experts. Illich's "learning webs" start with the people you already know.

**Trust self-direction.** Illich's deepest message: humans are natural learners. Children don't need institutions to develop curiosity - they need institutions to stop killing it.

## Illich's Final Years

Illich continued writing and lecturing through the 1980s and 1990s, turning his critical eye to medicine (*Medical Nemesis*), technology (*Tools for Conviviality*), and the nature of work.

In the early 1990s, he was diagnosed with cancer. True to his philosophy - he'd written extensively about the medical establishment's overreach - he chose to manage his own treatment rather than follow his doctors' sedative-heavy recommendations. He wanted to keep working.

Ivan Illich died at his home in Bremen, Germany on December 2, 2002. He was 76.

His ideas outlived him. John Holt, who developed unschooling, drew heavily from *Deschooling Society*. The homeschooling movement that exploded in the 1980s and 1990s found intellectual grounding in his work. Today's microschool founders, learning pod organizers, and self-directed education advocates walk paths Illich cleared fifty years ago.
