## Key Concepts from Deschooling Society

### The Core Argument
Not arguing for reform of schools, but for their **abolition**. The oppressive structure of the school system cannot be reformed - it must be dismantled.

### Three Purposes of a Functional Educational System
1. "Provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives"
2. "Empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them"
3. "Furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known"

### Learning Webs
Calls for advanced technology to support "learning webs" incorporating "peer-matching networks" - descriptions of a person's activities and skills mutually exchanged for education they would benefit from.

### Key Quote
"Even most intentional learning is not the result of programmed instruction."
