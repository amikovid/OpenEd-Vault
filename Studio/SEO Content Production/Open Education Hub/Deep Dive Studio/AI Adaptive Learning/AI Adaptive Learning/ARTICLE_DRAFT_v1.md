Joe Liemandt made his first billion in software. Then he more or less disappeared.

The founder of Trilogy Software—which built the first commercially successful AI system back in the 1990s—walked away from the spotlight and stayed gone for years. No TED talks, no podcast appearances, no thought-leader positioning. Just silence from one of tech's early AI pioneers.

In 2024, he resurfaced with an answer to a question most educators won't ask out loud: If you stripped away everything schools optimize for—compliance, crowd control, keeping administrators happy—and focused purely on learning, what would actually be possible?

His answer is Alpha School.

Students there complete core academics in two hours. The rest of their day looks nothing like traditional school: second-graders running 5Ks, fourth-graders passing Wharton MBA simulations, kindergarteners scaling 40-foot climbing walls. They test in the 99th percentile nationally.

The engine behind this isn't brilliant teaching or revolutionary curriculum. It's a platform called Incept that uses adaptive AI to personalize every lesson. A kid obsessed with baseball learns fractions through batting averages. A Taylor Swift fan explores World War I through concert logistics. The system tracks what each student knows, what they don't, and routes them through the gaps.

MacKenzie Price, the Stanford mom who co-founded Alpha with Liemandt, describes their philosophy simply: "High standards combined with high support." The AI handles the support—infinite patience, instant feedback, personalized pacing. Humans handle the standards, the mentorship, and the connection that makes kids actually want to show up.

Alpha's data suggests that when you teach to true mastery using personalized curricula, students can complete grade levels in 20-40 hours instead of the 180+ hours a traditional classroom requires.

They've since launched Alpha Anywhere, bringing the same two-hour learning engine to homeschools.

Which raises an uncomfortable question for the rest of us: If this is possible, what exactly are we doing with the other four hours?

## The Quality Divide Nobody Talks About

Alpha School represents one end of a spectrum. Most AI tutoring platforms sit somewhere else entirely.

Justin Skycak, who leads curriculum development at [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/), has spent years thinking about why. His explanation is blunt: "If you want to build a serious educational product, you can't be afraid to charge money for it."

The logic runs like this: Free or nearly-free platforms need massive user bases to survive. Massive user bases mean serving mostly casual users—kids who open the app because their parents told them to, not because they're genuinely trying to learn. To keep those users around, platforms optimize for engagement: bright colors, game mechanics, anything that feels fun and low-friction.

The problem is that real learning often doesn't feel fun. Retrieval practice—testing yourself to pull information from memory—is one of the most effective learning techniques researchers have ever documented. It's also effortful and sometimes frustrating. Spaced repetition, which spreads practice over time to strengthen long-term memory, requires patience. Deliberate practice means working at the edge of your ability, which by definition feels hard.

"Most people are not serious about learning," Skycak writes, "and if you depend on a massive base of unserious learners, then you have to employ ineffective learning strategies that do not repel unserious students. Which makes your product suck."

This explains a counterintuitive finding from a [2024 study](https://www.edutopia.org/article/ai-tutors-study-shows-pitfalls) on students using ChatGPT for practice problems. During practice, the AI-assisted students outperformed their peers. On actual tests, they bombed. They'd learned to extract answers from the AI without ever building the understanding themselves.

Teresa King, CEO of OpenEd Foundation, frames the distinction this way: "I hope that it is intelligent AI that can draw out and expand on skills that students have. From almost a tutoring perspective—not giving them the answers, right? But helping them get to answers. Doing intelligent work with them."

The best adaptive platforms are built around this Socratic principle. [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/), Khan Academy's AI tutor, won't simply solve a math problem. It asks guiding questions: *What do you think the first step might be? Can you explain your reasoning?* The goal is building understanding, not providing shortcuts.

Aaron Osmond, CEO of Knowledge Pillars, puts it more directly: "AI is nothing more than a technology tool. It does make things happen faster, more effective, more efficiently, but it doesn't problem solve everything for you. If you don't learn problem solving and critical thinking skills, you will not be successful in any career."

So how do you tell the difference between a platform that's actually teaching and one that's just entertaining?

A few questions help:

**Does it do the work for students, or guide students through work?** If a child can get the right answer without understanding why, the platform is optimizing for completion, not learning.

**Does it charge real money?** This isn't always determinative, but Skycak's point stands: serious educational products tend to charge serious prices because they're built for serious learners.

**Does it use proven learning science, or engagement tricks?** Look for spaced repetition, retrieval practice, mastery-based progression. Be skeptical of leaderboards, streaks, and virtual rewards that have nothing to do with actually understanding the material.

## Why the Good Ones Actually Work

In 1984, education researcher Benjamin Bloom published findings that would haunt the field for decades.

Students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than students in traditional classrooms. In practical terms: the average tutored student outperformed 98% of conventionally taught students. Bloom called it the "2 Sigma Problem"—the effect was real, but one-on-one tutoring doesn't scale. You can't hire a personal tutor for every child.

Forty years later, that's precisely what AI tutoring platforms are attempting. And unlike earlier ed-tech promises, some of them are actually delivering.

Alpha School's results are one data point. Math Academy's are another: students there compress entire grade levels into 20-40 hours of focused work, building what Skycak calls "automaticity"—the ability to execute foundational skills without conscious effort, freeing up mental bandwidth for higher-level reasoning.

The technical innovation behind Math Academy is something called Fractional Implicit Repetition, or FIRe. Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic as independent—you study fractions, then you study decimals, then you study percentages, each in isolation. But math is hierarchical. When you practice algebra, you're implicitly practicing arithmetic. When you work through calculus, you're reinforcing the algebra underneath it.

Math Academy's system tracks these relationships. When you practice an advanced concept, it credits you for the implicit practice of all the foundational concepts contained within it. The result is dramatically less redundant review time.

[Ben Somers](https://opened.co/podcast/the-school-to-prescription-pipeline-ben-somers-on-how-we-medicate-kids-who-dont-fit-the-mold), founder of Recess and former member of the Synthesis School team, explains why this matters: "School treats all knowledge like it goes in a line. In reality, knowledge is not ordered in a straight line. It's ordered in a big complex graph of ideas that are connected to each other in different ways."

Adaptive platforms map this graph. When a child struggles with fractions, the system can identify whether the gap is in understanding division, place value, or the concept of parts and wholes. It routes them to the prerequisite knowledge before pushing forward.

This is what Bloom hoped tutoring could do—meet each student exactly where they are. AI makes it possible at scale.

But scale introduces its own problems.
