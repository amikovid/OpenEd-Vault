# Preliminary SEO Strategy - AI Adaptive Learning Article

**Status:** Awaiting librarian agent research (bg_60b982f8, bg_90574fd0)

---

## Likely Primary Keyword Candidates

Based on search behavior patterns:

### Top Contenders:
1. **"AI tutor for kids"** - Parent-specific, clear intent
2. **"best AI tutor"** - Comparison/review intent
3. **"adaptive learning apps"** - Broader search, tool-seeking
4. **"AI tutoring platforms"** - More technical, comparison intent

### Supporting Keywords:
- "personalized learning software"
- "AI tutor vs human tutor"
- "adaptive learning for homeschool"
- "best math tutor app"
- "AI learning apps for kids"

---

## Predicted Search Intent

### What Parents Are Looking For:
1. **Tool recommendations** - "What should I use?"
2. **Comparisons** - "Which one is best for my kid?"
3. **Understanding** - "How does this actually work?"
4. **Concerns** - "Is this safe/effective/worth it?"
5. **Implementation** - "How do I actually use this?"

### Content Types That Likely Rank:
- Listicles ("10 Best AI Tutors for Kids")
- Comparison guides ("AI Tutor vs Human Tutor")
- Comprehensive guides ("Complete Guide to AI Tutoring")
- Tool-specific reviews

---

## Our Competitive Advantages

### What Only OpenEd Can Provide:
1. **Expert quotes** - Justin Skycak (Math Academy), Ray Ravaglia (Stanford Online), Ben Somers (Synthesis/Recess)
2. **Real implementation stories** - Alpha School case study (MacKenzie Price, Joe Liemandt)
3. **Practitioner perspective** - Teresa King (OpenEd CEO), Aaron Osmond (Knowledge Pillars)
4. **Nuanced take** - Not just "AI good" or "AI bad" but "here's when it works and when it doesn't"
5. **Homeschool-specific** - Most content is generic K-12 or EdTech industry pieces

---

## Content Gaps to Exploit

### Likely Missing from Competitor Content:
1. **The science behind WHY it works** - Most articles list features, not cognitive science (we have Justin's FIRe algorithm, spaced repetition research)
2. **When NOT to use AI tutors** - Everyone sells, we can be honest (Ray Ravaglia on human connection, Ben Somers on friendship)
3. **The EdTech quality divide** - Justin's "why EdTech is soft" insight
4. **Real proof points** - Alpha School's 2-hour school days, 99th percentile results, $1B backing
5. **Implementation framework** - Most articles just list tools, don't tell you HOW to actually use them

---

## Proposed Article Structure (Before SEO Research)

### Opening:
**Proof** - Alpha School case study (grab attention with results)

### Body Sections (will refine based on keyword research):
1. **What AI Tutors Actually Do** (targeting: "how do AI tutors work")
2. **The Science Behind the Best Systems** (targeting: "adaptive learning", "personalized learning")
3. **AI vs Human: What Can't Be Replaced** (targeting: "AI tutor vs human tutor")
4. **How to Actually Use AI Tutors** (targeting: "how to use AI tutors", implementation questions)
5. **Tool Recommendations** (targeting: "best AI tutor for kids", comparison searches)

### Supporting:
- FAQ section (capture long-tail questions)
- Tool comparison table (visual, scannable)
- OpenEd integration/CTA
