## Key OpenEd Frameworks

### 1. The STEM Spectrum (Jack Casdorph)

Traditional education spends too much time on the left side:

```
ABSTRACT ←――――――――――――――――――――→ APPLIED
Math → Science → Engineering → Technology/Making
(theory)                        (practice)
```

**Key quote:** "The stuff on the right isn't even touched in most education."

### 2. Two-Week Learning Sprints (Open Education Book)

From Matt Bowman's *Open Education*:

1. Create a Discovery Zone (wall, poster board, back of door)
2. Post five questions:
   - What do I like to learn about?
   - What do I like to do in my free time?
   - What am I good at?
   - What would I like to get better at?
   - What do I genuinely dislike?
3. Give everyone colored sticky notes (one color per family member)
4. Over one week, everyone adds thoughts
5. Pick one interest per person for a two-week "learning sprint"

**Key quote:** "The hard part is trusting that your kid's curiosity is a better compass than a pacing guide written for 30 strangers."

### 3. The Mars Approach (Open Education Book)

"In 2012, NASA's Curiosity rover touched down on Mars. Before it could begin exploring, engineers had to solve a fundamental challenge: how do you design something to explore a world you've never visited?

They started with three essential questions:
- What does Mars need us to discover?
- What unique capabilities can we develop?
- What resources do we have?

Your child's education requires the same approach. Your child's educational landscape is an unmapped terrain waiting to be explored. You can't use someone else's map or calendar. You need to chart your own course."

### 4. Theory-First vs Practice-First (Template)

**Traditional (Theory-First):**
1. Memorize scientific method steps
2. Study abstract formulas and concepts
3. Complete artificial problems
4. Maybe, eventually, do something real

**Practice-First (OpenEd approach):**
1. Start with an engaging project (treehouse, bridge, chicken coop)
2. Encounter genuine problems
3. Develop skills as needed
4. Discover principles through experience

### 5. Sesame Street Scientific Method

"My favorite version of the scientific method actually comes from watching Sesame Street with my kids: **'I wonder, what if, let's try.'** I really like that simpler version of just 'let's try it.'"
— Jack Casdorph

## Real OpenEd Student Examples

### First-Grader: Chicken Keeping
"A first-grader in the OpenEd program proudly reports in his learning logs about collecting eggs daily and caring for both chicks and mature hens."

### Fourth-Grader: Egg Business
"A fourth-grader has taken her chicken project to the next level, documenting how she 'has begun packaging and selling her organic chicken eggs and worked on a business plan.'"

### Darryll Stinson's Kids: Entrepreneur Bug
"My daughter starts a new business every 90 days and burns through our money just as fast. But here's what matters: They're expressed. They're learning. And most importantly, they see that they have a say in their future."

"They'd listen to me do sales calls in the car and were ready to run businesses by summer's end."

## Key Stories / Hooks

### Jack Casdorph's Treehouse (Origin Story)
When Jack was nine, he asked his dad to build him a treehouse. His father's response: "Nope. But I can help YOU build a treehouse."

What followed:
1. First, Jack needed to become "monkey enough" at climbing trees
2. Next came drilling lessons on the back deck
3. Then design planning with careful measurements
4. Finally, construction with newly acquired skills

### Jack's Interest Destroyed (Anti-Example)
"We did a simple experiment where we magnetized a needle and put it on a foam packing peanut in a bowl of water to make a homemade compass. The experiment itself took maybe 25 seconds. Then we spent half an hour doing a writeup where the teacher dictated, verbatim, what we were supposed to write."

"Even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed, my interest in science at that time was totally destroyed."

### Darryll Stinson's "Law of Exposure"
***The mind when stretched never returns to its original form.***

His kids went back to school after summer of open education - but now they noticed the rigidity. They missed the adventure. Having been exposed to the possibility, they knew there were options.

## Why Practice-First Works (Three Advantages)

1. **Motivation becomes intrinsic** - When a fourth-grader packages and sells her chicken eggs, she's developing entrepreneurial skills through genuine interest, not classroom exercises.

2. **Subject boundaries dissolve** - Chicken keeping isn't "science time" or "math hour" - it's life. You calculate feed-to-egg ratios (math), research why your Buff Orpington sounds strange (biology), and petition the city council to increase the allowed flock size (civics).

3. **Children learn at their natural pace** - Different children progress through hands-on projects at different speeds, developing according to their unique timeline rather than an arbitrary standard.

## Unique OpenEd Angle

**What competitors miss:**
- Generic PBL articles explain the concept but don't show real families doing it
- They lack proprietary frameworks (STEM spectrum, Two-Week Sprints, Mars Approach)
- No real student examples with outcomes

**OpenEd's differentiation:**
- Actual student learning logs showing PBL in action
- Multiple proprietary frameworks from the Open Education book
- Podcast guests who've lived it (Jack, Darryll)
- The Sesame Street scientific method framing
- Connection to homeschool context (not just classroom)

## Mark Rober / Maker Culture Content

### The Super Mario Effect (Mark Rober's Experiment)

From [#104 - 2025: The Year Learning Gets Personal](https://opened.co/newsletter/2025-the-year-learning-gets-personal):

50,000 participants attempted a coding puzzle:
- **Group 1:** Lost points for failed attempts → 27% success
- **Group 2:** No penalties for trying → 68% success (and 2.5x more attempts)

"Rober calls this the 'Super Mario Effect' - in the game, dying isn't a setback. You restart and try again, bringing your new knowledge with you. No permanent record of failures, just progress toward the goal."

**Mark Rober Quote:**
"Thinking like an engineer means you're resilient. It's getting back up after being knocked down and approaching things differently."

### CrunchLabs Description (OpenEd Content)

"CrunchLabs sends monthly boxes that teach kids to think like engineers by building their own toys and robots. But unlike many STEM subscription boxes that end up in the closet after one use, these projects are designed to be played with, hacked, and modified. Kids build disc launchers and IR turrets, learning physics, engineering, and problem-solving along the way."

- Build Box (ages 8-13): Monthly projects
- Hack Pack (ages 14+): Advanced projects every two months

### KiwiCo Data (OpenEd Marketplace)

From [What OpenEd families are searching for in the marketplace](https://opened.co/newsletter/what-opened-families-are-searching-for):

"**KiwiCo** - 101 searches. The subscription box that keeps showing up. Parents are hunting for hands-on STEM projects that arrive ready to go."
