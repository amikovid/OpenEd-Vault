<p>"The experiment took 25 seconds. The writeup took 30 minutes. And that's when my interest in science was totally destroyed."</p>

<p>Jack Casdorph remembers the day clearly. His class magnetized a needle, floated it on a foam packing peanut in a bowl of water, and watched it swing north. They were making a homemade compass - the kind of thing that should spark wonder.</p>

<p>Instead, the teacher handed out worksheets. For the next half hour, students copied - verbatim - what they were supposed to have learned. "Even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed," Jack recalls, "my interest in science at that time was totally destroyed."</p>

<p>Jack went on to become a mechanical engineer and educator who now advocates for project-based learning - the approach that saved his own curiosity years later, when his father refused to build him a treehouse and offered to help him build one instead.</p>

<h2>What Is Project-Based Learning?</h2>

<p>Project-based learning is education through extended, real-world projects where children direct their own learning toward meaningful outcomes.</p>

<p>The key word is <em>meaningful</em>. A worksheet about fractions isn't project-based learning. Neither is a diorama assigned by a teacher with a rubric. Project-based learning starts with something the child actually wants to create, solve, or understand - and lets the learning emerge from that pursuit.</p>

<p>Jack Casdorph describes traditional education as spending too much time on the wrong side of a spectrum:</p>

<pre><code>ABSTRACT ←――――――――――――――――――――→ APPLIED
Math → Science → Engineering → Technology/Making</code></pre>

<p>"The stuff on the right isn't even touched in most education," he explains on the <a href="https://opened.co/blog/have-we-been-teaching-stem-completely-backwards-the-case-for-project-based-learning">OpenEd podcast</a>. Traditional schools start with theory and hope students eventually connect it to reality. Project-based learning flips this: start with reality, and theory follows naturally.</p>

<p>A child building a go-kart will encounter gear ratios, torque, and friction - not because someone assigned Chapter 7, but because the go-kart won't move without understanding them.</p>

<h2>Why Traditional Education Has It Backwards</h2>

<p>Consider two approaches to teaching the scientific method:</p>

<p><strong>Traditional (Theory-First):</strong></p>

<ol><li>Memorize the steps: hypothesis, experiment, observation, conclusion.</li><li>Study abstract formulas and concepts.</li><li>Complete problems from a textbook.</li><li>Maybe, eventually, do something real.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Practice-First:</strong></p>

<ol><li>Start with an engaging project - a treehouse, a bridge, a chicken coop.</li><li>Encounter genuine problems that need solving.</li><li>Develop skills as the project demands them.</li><li>Discover principles through direct experience.</li></ol>

<p><a href="https://opened.co/blog/5-questions-with-tuttle-twins-creator-connor-boyack">Connor Boyack</a>, creator of the Tuttle Twins book series, calls traditional education the "just in case" model. Just in case you become a rocket scientist, memorize the quadratic equation now. Just in case you become a marine biologist, know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.</p>

<p>The problem? That's not how humans actually learn.</p>

<p>"When your refrigerator breaks down," Boyack points out, "at no point do you say, 'I'm so glad that eleven years ago I read the instruction manual cover to cover just in case.' Of course not. Just in time for when you need to fix it, you're pulling up YouTube, calling Uncle Bob who's super handy."</p>

<p>Project-based learning operates on this "just in time" model. Children don't stockpile knowledge for hypothetical futures. They acquire skills when those skills become necessary to accomplish something they care about.</p>

<p>When Jack's father refused to build him a treehouse, he didn't just say no. He said: "I can help YOU build a treehouse."</p>

<p>What followed took months. First, Jack needed to become "monkey enough" at climbing trees to work safely at height. Then came drilling lessons on the back deck. Then design planning with measurements. Then, finally, construction.</p>

<p>By the end, Jack understood carpentry, basic engineering, planning, and persistence - none of which appeared on a worksheet. The treehouse still stands.</p>

<p>He proposes his favorite version of the scientific method, which comes from <em>Sesame Street</em>: "I wonder, what if, let's try." That's it. No five-paragraph writeup required.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Project-Based Learning</h2>

<p>In a viral experiment, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober">Mark Rober</a> - the former NASA engineer with 110 million YouTube subscribers - gave 50,000 people a simple coding puzzle.</p>

<p>Half the participants lost points every time they failed. The other half faced no penalty for trying.</p>

<p>The results were striking: the no-penalty group succeeded 68% of the time, compared to just 27% for the penalized group. Even more telling, they tried 2.5 times more often.</p>

<p>Rober calls this the "Super Mario Effect." In the game, dying isn't a permanent failure - you restart and try again, bringing what you learned with you. No permanent record of mistakes, just progress toward the goal.</p>

<p>"Thinking like an engineer means you're resilient," Rober explains. "It's getting back up after being knocked down and approaching things differently."</p>

<p>Project-based learning creates this same dynamic. When a child's go-kart doesn't work, that's not an F on a report card. It's information. Adjust and try again.</p>

<p>Beyond resilience, three evidence-backed advantages emerge:</p>

<h3>1\. Motivation Becomes Intrinsic</h3>

<p>A fourth-grader in the OpenEd program packages and sells organic eggs from her backyard flock. She tracks expenses, calculates profit margins, and adjusts pricing based on feed costs. No one assigned this business plan. She wanted to know if her venture was actually making money.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://opened.co/blog/kids-skipped-school">Darryll Stinson</a> pulled his kids from traditional school for a summer, they listened to him make sales calls in the car. By summer's end, they were ready to start their own businesses. "My daughter starts a new business every 90 days and burns through our money just as fast," he admits. "But here's what matters: They're expressed. They're learning. And they see that they have a say in their future."</p>

<h3>2\. Subject Boundaries Dissolve</h3>

<p>Backyard chicken keeping doesn't fit neatly into "science time" or "math hour." It's life.</p>

<p>You calculate feed-to-egg ratios (math). You research why your Buff Orpington sounds strange (biology). You petition the city council to increase the allowed flock size (civics). You design a predator-proof coop (engineering). You sell eggs at the farmers market (entrepreneurship).</p>

<p>No one asks "when will I ever use this?" because the answer is obvious: right now.</p>

<h3>3\. Children Learn at Their Natural Pace</h3>

<p>A first-grader in our program proudly reports daily egg collection and chick health in his learning logs. He's seven. No curriculum told him to track calcium intake for laying hens - he wanted to understand why some eggs have thin shells.</p>

<p>Different children progress through hands-on projects at different speeds. That's not a bug; it's a feature. One child might spend six months obsessed with robotics. Another might cycle through cooking, coding, and carpentry in the same period. Both are learning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edutopia.org/pbl-research-practices-disciplines">Edutopia published a roundup of research showing that project-based learners outperform traditional students on standardized measures</a> - while also developing collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving skills that tests don't capture. For instance, <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/pbl-research-annotated-bibliography#finkelstein">a randomized control trial on a project-based high school economics curriculum</a> found that PBL students "scored significantly higher on problem-solving skills and in their ability to apply knowledge to real-world economic challenges than students taught economics using traditional methods."</p>

<h2>Project-Based Learning Examples</h2>

<p>What does project-based learning actually look like? Here are real examples across different interests:</p>

<p><strong>Building & Making:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Treehouses and forts (carpentry, planning, safety)</li><li>Chicken coops (design, animal husbandry, local regulations)</li><li>Go-karts and soap box racers (physics, mechanical engineering)</li><li>Arduino electronics projects (coding, circuits, troubleshooting)</li></ul>

<p><strong>Business & Entrepreneurship:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Egg sales from backyard flocks</li><li>Etsy shops for crafts or art</li><li>YouTube channels or podcasts</li><li>Neighborhood services (lawn care, pet sitting, tutoring)</li></ul>

<p><strong>Science & Exploration:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Mark Rober-style experiments (his YouTube channel is a masterclass)</li><li>Backyard wildlife documentation</li><li>Weather tracking and prediction</li><li>Cooking as chemistry</li></ul>

<p><strong>Technology & Digital:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Minecraft mods and game design</li><li>App or website building</li><li>Video editing and production</li><li>3D printing and CAD design</li></ul>

<p>The key: these aren't assignments. They're pursuits the child chose, with outcomes that matter to them.</p>

<h2>How to Start: The Two-Week Sprint Method</h2>

<p>Getting started doesn't require overhauling your entire approach. Try a two-week experiment using this framework from the <a href="https://opened.co/book">Open Education book</a>:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create a Discovery Zone</h3>

<p>Find a wall, poster board, or back of a door. This becomes your family's idea space.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Post Five Questions</h3>

<p>Write these where everyone can see them:</p>

<ul><li>What do I like to learn about?</li><li>What do I like to do in my free time?</li><li>What am I good at?</li><li>What would I like to get better at?</li><li>What do I genuinely dislike?</li></ul>

<h3>Step 3: Distribute Colored Sticky Notes</h3>

<p>Give each family member their own color. Parents participate too.</p>

<h3>Step 4: One Week of Adding Thoughts</h3>

<p>Over the next seven days, everyone adds sticky notes whenever inspiration strikes. No judgment, no editing, no "that's not educational" filtering.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Pick One Interest Per Person</h3>

<p>At week's end, each person chooses one sticky note to explore in a two-week "learning sprint."</p>

<h3>Step 6: Execute the Sprint</h3>

<p>Gather resources. Take field trips. Build things. Watch videos. Talk to experts. Let the interest lead.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Reflect and Iterate</h3>

<p>After two weeks: What worked? What didn't? What's next?</p>

<p>The hard part is trusting that your kid's curiosity is a better compass than a pacing guide written by strangers. But that trust is exactly what makes this work.</p>

<h2>The Mars Approach to Curriculum</h2>

<p>In 2012, NASA's Curiosity rover touched down on Mars. Before it could begin exploring, engineers faced a fundamental challenge: how do you design something to explore a world you've never visited?</p>

<p>They started with three essential questions:</p>

<ul><li>What does Mars need us to discover?</li><li>What unique capabilities can we develop?</li><li>What resources do we have?</li></ul>

<p>Your child's education requires the same approach. Their educational landscape is unmapped terrain waiting to be explored. You can't use someone else's map or calendar. You need to chart your own course.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean abandoning all structure. It means building structure around your specific child, their specific interests, and your specific resources - rather than conforming them to a template designed for a classroom of thirty.</p>

<h2>Project Ideas by Age</h2>

<h3>Elementary (K-5)</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://opened.co/blog/backyard-chickens-the-ultimate-hands-on-homeschooling-project-2">Backyard chickens</a> with egg tracking</li><li>Simple machines from household items</li><li>Nature journals and wildlife observation</li><li>Mini-businesses (lemonade stands, craft sales)</li><li>Cooking projects with measurements and timing</li></ul>

<h3>Middle School (6-8)</h3>

<ul><li>Arduino and basic electronics</li><li>YouTube channel or podcast production</li><li>Community service projects with real impact</li><li>Meal planning and family cooking</li><li>Building and construction projects</li></ul>

<h3>High School (9-12)</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://opened.co/blog/apprenticeships-cte-guide">Internships or apprenticeships</a></li><li>App or website development</li><li>Research projects with publishable outcomes</li><li>Real entrepreneurship (Etsy shop, tutoring business)</li><li>Passion projects with portfolio potential</li></ul>

<h3>Subscription Boxes That Support PBL</h3>

<p>If you want structured starting points:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://kiwico.com/"><strong>KiwiCo</strong></a> - Age-appropriate STEM projects (ages 0-16+)</li><li><a href="https://crunchlabs.com/"><strong>Crunch Labs</strong></a> - Mark Rober's engineering kits</li><li><a href="https://melscience.com/"><strong>Mel Science</strong></a> - Chemistry experiments delivered monthly</li><li><a href="https://www.littlepassports.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorAxnIylhr2BigwW6w60YiR5kvLP16hEiMQwmp<em>oEiYwJe</em>l8CN"><strong>Little Passports</strong></a> - Geography and cultural exploration</li></ul>

<p>These work best as springboards, not endpoints. The box gets you started; where you take it is up to you.</p>

<h2>Common Challenges (And Honest Solutions)</h2>

<h3>"My kid just wants to play video games."</h3>

<p>Lean into it. Minecraft mods teach basic coding. Game design requires art, storytelling, and logic. Viewing YouTube tutorials on gaming can evolve into making YouTube tutorials. The interest isn't the problem - it's the starting point.</p>

<h3>"How do I know they're learning?"</h3>

<p>Documentation helps. Learning logs, photos of projects, portfolios of work. But also: trust your eyes. A child who can explain why their go-kart's gear ratio matters has learned physics. Whether they can fill in a worksheet about it is secondary.</p>

<h3>"What about standardized tests?"</h3>

<p>Research consistently shows project-based learners perform as well or better on standardized tests than traditionally educated peers - while developing skills tests don't measure. Germany's Realschule system has combined rigorous academics with practical training for over a century.</p>

<h3>"I don't have the skills to mentor projects."</h3>

<p>Good news: you don't need to be an expert. Learn alongside your child. Use YouTube, online courses, local makers, and community experts. A parent who says "I don't know - let's figure it out together" models exactly the mindset project-based learning develops.</p>

<h2>How OpenEd Supports Project-Based Learning</h2>

<p>One reason project-based learning thrives in homeschool settings: flexibility. You control the schedule, the approach, and the pace. No bells, no semesters, no arbitrary subject boundaries.</p>

<p><a href="https://opened.co/">OpenEd</a> amplifies this flexibility. Families in our program get access to a marketplace of resources, reimbursement for educational expenses, and the freedom to structure learning around their child's interests - whether that's a two-week robotics sprint or a semester-long chicken business.</p>

<p>The platform includes learning logs where students can document project progress, turning that go-kart build or egg business into a portfolio of real work. And because OpenEd handles the compliance paperwork, parents can focus on what matters: supporting their child's curiosity.</p>

<p>OpenEd is currently available in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah. <a href="https://opened.co/">Learn more about the program</a>.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>What is project-based learning?</strong></p>

<p>Project-based learning (PBL) is an educational approach where students learn by actively engaging in real-world projects over an extended period. Unlike traditional education that starts with theory, PBL starts with meaningful problems and lets students discover concepts through doing.</p>

<p><strong>What are the 7 steps of project-based learning?</strong></p>

<p>The Two-Week Sprint method:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Create a Discovery Zone</strong></li><li><strong>Post five key questions</strong></li><li><strong>Give everyone colored sticky notes</strong></li><li><strong>Spend one week adding thoughts</strong></li><li><strong>Pick one interest per person</strong></li><li><strong>Execute a two-week learning sprint</strong></li><li><strong>Reflect and iterate</strong></li></ol>

<p><strong>What are examples of project-based learning?</strong></p>

<p>Building projects (treehouses, go-karts), entrepreneurship (egg sales, Etsy shops), technology (Minecraft mods, app building), science experiments, YouTube content creation, and community service projects.</p>

<p><strong>Is project-based learning effective?</strong></p>

<p>Research consistently shows PBL students perform as well or better than traditionally educated peers on standardized tests, while developing collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving skills that traditional methods often miss.</p>

<p><strong>How do I start project-based learning at home?</strong></p>

<p>Start with the Two-Week Sprint method: Create a Discovery Zone. Read <a href="https://opened.co/book">Open Education by Matt Bowman</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Based-Homeschooling-Mentoring-Self-Directed-Learners/dp/1475239068">Project-Based Homeschooling by Lori Pickert</a>. Then, let the learning lead.</p>

<p>Remember Jack Casdorph and the compass experiment that killed his love of science? The thirty-minute writeup didn't teach him anything - except that science was boring.</p>

<p>But that treehouse his father helped him build? Twenty years later, it's still standing. So is the curiosity his father rekindled by refusing to do the work for him.</p>

<p>That's the difference project-based learning makes. Real problems that demand real solutions. "Just in time" discovery instead of "just in case" memorization.</p>

<p>Your child doesn't need more worksheets. They need a project worth caring about - and a parent willing to help them build it.</p>
