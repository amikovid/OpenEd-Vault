# State Pages

**Goal:** Create comprehensive state-specific guides that drive bottom-of-funnel traffic.

**Q1 Priority States:** Oregon, Nevada, Indiana

---

## Strategic Nuance (IMPORTANT)

OpenEd families are technically NOT homeschoolers in the eyes of the state. When enrolled in OpenEd:
- They're students of an accredited program
- Different legal requirements apply
- But they IDENTIFY as homeschoolers culturally

**The balance:** 
- Cover what traditional homeschoolers need to know (laws, requirements)
- Position OpenEd as a simpler path that handles compliance for you
- Don't strip families of their homeschool identity
- Emphasize "at-home education" and flexibility, not "you're not really homeschooling"

---

## Keyword Strategy

### Primary Target (Test Both)
| Keyword Pattern | Intent | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| "homeschool program in [state]" | Commercial | Looking for a solution - HIGH INTENT |
| "how to homeschool in [state]" | Informational | Earlier in journey - HIGH VOLUME |

**Recommendation:** Create pages that satisfy BOTH intents. Lead with "how to" (captures volume), position OpenEd as the answer (captures intent).

### Search Intent Verification (Do Before Writing)

**Question:** Does our template actually match what people searching "homeschool program in [state]" want?

**To verify:**
1. Google the exact phrase "homeschool program in [state]"
2. Analyze top 3-5 results:
   - What format are they? (List of programs? How-to guide? Vendor page?)
   - What questions do they answer?
   - What's missing?
3. Check "People Also Ask" for related questions
4. Adjust template if search intent differs from our assumption

**Hypothesis:** "Homeschool program in [state]" searchers may want:
- A LIST of available programs (like OpenEd, charter schools, virtual schools)
- Comparison of options
- How to enroll in a specific program

If so, our template may need a **"Programs Available in [State]"** section that positions OpenEd alongside (and above) alternatives.

**TODO:** Run this verification for Oregon before writing first page.

### Secondary Keywords to Weave In
- [state] homeschool laws
- [state] homeschool requirements  
- homeschool stipend [state] (where applicable)
- [state] homeschool curriculum
- ESA [state] / education savings account [state]

---

## Competitor Analysis

### HSLDA (hslda.org/legal/[state])
**Structure:**
- Law at a glance (bullet points)
- Compulsory age, notification, teacher qualifications
- Assessment requirements
- Links to detailed articles
- Member-only resources (forms, deep dives)

**Strengths:** Authoritative, comprehensive legal info
**Weakness:** Dry, no personality, no curriculum guidance, membership-gated

### Power Homeschool
**Structure:** Generic state pages with:
- State homeschool laws overview
- Getting started steps
- Links to their program

**Weakness:** Thin content, heavily promotional

### Our Angle
We can beat both by providing:
1. Legal clarity (like HSLDA) but FREE and accessible
2. Curriculum recommendations (they don't have this)
3. Local resources (co-ops, micro schools, maker labs)
4. Funding options (ESA, OpenEd reimbursement)
5. Real parent perspectives (testimonials by state)
6. The "OpenEd Path" as a simpler alternative

## Avoiding Duplicate Content (Critical for Scaling)

Based on 2025-2026 SEO research, to avoid thin content penalties when scaling state pages:

### DO:
- Include state-specific legal details (these ARE different)
- Add local resources unique to each state
- Include state-specific testimonials
- Reference state-specific funding (ESAs vary wildly)
- Use state-specific schema markup

### DON'T:
- Copy/paste generic homeschool advice across all pages
- Use identical "how to choose curriculum" sections
- Have 80% identical content with just state name swapped

### Quality Checklist (Per Page)
- [ ] At least 40% unique content (not just state name swapped)
- [ ] State-specific legal requirements verified
- [ ] Local resources researched and included
- [ ] Funding options accurate for this state
- [ ] At least one state-specific testimonial (if available)
- [ ] Internal links to relevant content
