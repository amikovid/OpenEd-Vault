## What To Ask Colleagues

### Ask Partnerships / Finance (Grant Hewitt, Lauren Hodge, Kendall Hawkins)
1. **Wallet amounts** for Arkansas, Montana, Nevada - what's the per-student funding?
2. **Competitor landscape by state** - Charlie noted "Ela might have docs with Nicole laying out competitors in different states." Who are the Fossil DLP equivalents in each state?
3. **Grade level expansions** - Confirmed OR and UT going K-12 Fall 26. Any others?
4. **Indiana positioning** - How do we talk about the voucher model vs. district model in other states? Co-ops have been hostile.

### Ask Marketing / Family Success (Melissa Wurzel, Ela Bass)
5. **Parent testimonials** per state - Any from #openedlove or Family Success that we can quote?
6. **Nevada urgency** - Melissa flagged as "major growth lever." Any specific messaging direction?
7. **Landing page URLs** per state - Do these already exist? (Wyoming LP was in staging as of Jan 28)

### Ask Learning / Teachers (Andrea Fife, Megan Hennessy)
8. **Assessment opt-out language** - How does OpenEd message this? Nevada and Kansas confirmed "we will NOT advertise opt-out." Consistent across states?
9. **Sports participation** - Iowa families can only participate at Clarinda, not local school. Same restriction in other states?

## Competitive Landscape

### Competitor Summary Table

| State | Main Competitor(s) | Their Model | OpenEd Differentiator |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Oregon | **Fossil DLP** | Virtual charter, $2,500/kid (matched OpenEd Jun 2025), debit card, lottery, religious curriculum approved | No lottery/waitlist, fewer required meetings, expanding to K-12. Fossil's debit card + fast reimbursement is parent favorite. |
| Oregon | TEACH Northwest, Baker-Webb (exited May 2025) | Flexible charter; district virtual provider | Less generous allowance, less flexible |
| Utah | **Harmony Education** | Portfolio-based homeschool, K-8 only | K-12 coverage, human support, SE with public schools. "If OpenEd opened funds up completely, Harmony would have no chance" |
| Utah | Utah Fits All (ESA), Utah Online School, Alpha Anywhere | ESA ($4K-$8K); traditional online school; at-home 2-hr model | OpenEd handles compliance; more flexibility; 15+ year track record |
| Indiana | **Braintree Academy** | Public school partnership, similar wallet model | 60% of IN students switching from Braintree cite better platform, reimbursement, less paperwork. Braintree has monthly field trips with paid local coordinators. |
| Indiana | Overture | Similar reimbursement model | Less prominent |
| Minnesota | **Venture Upward** | Homeschool support + reimbursement (direct competition) | Growing partner network; Isaac suggested potentially acquiring them |
| Iowa | **HSAPs (district programs)** | District-run mini-schools with gym, cafeteria, extracurriculars | Strategy: be COMPLEMENTARY to HSAPs, not replacement. "HSAPs are our main competitors, not other programs" (Ela) |
| Iowa | Iowa Connections Academy, Iowa Virtual Academy | Set curriculum (Pearson/K12), 180-day requirement | Curriculum flexibility, reimbursement wallet, technology provision |
| Kansas | Limited intel | ? | **ASK COLLEAGUES** |
| Arkansas | Limited intel | ? | **ASK COLLEAGUES** |
| Montana | Limited intel | ? | **ASK COLLEAGUES** |
| Nevada | One unnamed virtual charter | Only enrolls near Las Vegas (testing logistics) | Statewide coverage |
| Wyoming | **Braintree Academy** | Active at braintree4me.com/wyoming, copying OpenEd meta descriptions | Build comparison pages before launch (Ela's strategy) |
| Oklahoma | **Braintree Academy** | Ramped up recruiting (Jul 2025) | Still in contracting phase |
| New Mexico | **Stride/K12 (Destinations Career Academy of NM)** | K-12 tuition-free virtual public school | RISE is live instruction model, different positioning |

### Key Reference Documents (from Slack)
- **Master competitor spreadsheet (Jared Fuller):** Slack doc at `opened-hq.slack.com/docs/T013J8YAX8B/F08LX1CT6TE`
- **Iowa competitor spreadsheet:** `docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GtYWavS14nhKEnCbtGrwi6HN471gZ9_9K1Sf8k-Jaqc/edit`
- **Nicole Spencer landscape report:** Ela + Nicole compiling state-by-state competitor data. Charlie noted (Jan 2026): "Ela might have docs with Nicole laying out competitors in different states." Ela asked Charlie (Apr 2025): "do you have a working document of states and each competitor in each state? Nicole is doing a TON of research on this."
- **MN state launch doc:** `docs.google.com/document/d/1Dhe8GiTXFWmlGPMvRaqUgOn-rq1WjBjw7_COMcNDJ6E/edit`

### Oregon: Fossil DLP Deep Comparison (for template)
**Why families choose Fossil over OpenEd** (direct from parent ambassador Charlynn, Jan 2026):
- Long-standing reputation in Oregon
- Debit card reimbursement (pre-approved, pre-loaded funds, days not weeks)
- Field trips (OpenEd has since addressed this)
- Religious curriculum approved
- More in-person connection with staff
- Quarterly work samples vs. weekly logs

**Why families choose OpenEd over Fossil:**
- No lottery or waitlist (direct enrollment)
- Higher per-student funding ($2,500 vs $2,000 until Jun 2025 match)
- Less paperwork, fewer required meetings
- High school program launching 2026-27
- More hands-off approach
- Greater options for reimbursement categories

**Critical update (Jan 2026):** Fossil matched OpenEd's $2,500 allotment. Fossil now reimburses faith-based curriculum. OpenEd reviewing same for SY26-27.

### Indiana: Braintree Deep Comparison
- Of 305 students who told OpenEd they came from a public school in IN, **182 (60%) came from Braintree** (Jun 2025)
- Braintree runs monthly field trips with paid local parent coordinators (popular)
- Co-ops have accused OpenEd, Braintree, Harmony, and Overture of "fraud" re: voucher funding breakdown
- OpenEd deliberately lists dollar amounts on IN landing pages to compete head-to-head

### OpenEd's Universal Competitive Advantages (from Slack)
1. Curriculum flexibility (choose your own, not locked to Pearson/K12/Edmentum)
2. Wallet reimbursement model
3. No mandatory synchronous instruction (except RISE/NM)
4. Human support ("I cannot believe we have a live person to talk to" -- parent switching from Harmony)
5. Platform quality and parent-friendliness
6. Expanding K-12 coverage (OR, UT confirmed for Fall 26)
7. No SEO competition ("None of our competitors had an SEO strategy when we started" -- Melissa, Feb 2026)

### Strategic Notes
- **Comparison pages:** Ela proposed building "OpenEd vs [Competitor]" pages for every state with a direct competitor, prioritizing pre-launch states (Jan 2026)
- **Religious curriculum:** Fossil's move to allow faith-based is pulling OR families. OpenEd planning to allow in OR for SY26-27.
- **Reimbursement speed:** Fossil's debit card / fast turnaround is recurring parent preference. Operational improvement opportunity.
- **Lauren Hodge flagged:** Calling OpenEd a "homeschool program" when legally it is not could be a challenge. Important positioning note for all state pages.
