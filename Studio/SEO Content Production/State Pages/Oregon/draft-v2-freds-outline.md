## How to Start Homeschooling in Oregon (Step-by-Step)

You have two main paths in Oregon. Both are legitimate. The right choice depends on how much support you want.

### Path 1: Traditional Homeschooling (DIY)

If you want complete independence:

1. **Notify your local ESD** within 10 days of starting
2. **Choose your curriculum** (or create your own)
3. **Keep records** of instruction (recommended)
4. **Complete state assessments** in grades 3, 5, 8, and 10

That's it. No approval needed. No curriculum requirements. You're in charge.

**Best for:** Families who want maximum control and don't need financial support for curriculum.

### Path 2: Enroll in a Flexible Public Program

Programs like OpenEd and Fossil Distance Learning handle the administrative side while you educate at home. You're technically enrolled in a public school, which means:

- Access to curriculum funds at no cost
- Certified teacher support when you need it
- Compliance paperwork handled for you
- You still choose what and how your child learns

**Best for:** Families who want flexibility plus support - and access to funding for curriculum and activities.

## Legal Considerations for Homeschooling in Oregon

### Who Can Homeschool

Any parent or legal guardian can homeschool in Oregon. No teaching credentials required. No college degree needed.

### Compulsory Attendance

Children ages 6-18 must receive instruction. You can begin homeschooling at any time during the school year.

### What Happens If You Don't Comply

Oregon's ESD notification is straightforward, but skipping it can trigger truancy concerns. File the paperwork - it takes 10 minutes and protects you.

### Special Education

If your child has an IEP or 504 plan, you can still homeschool. Traditional homeschoolers forfeit public school services. Families enrolled in flexible programs like OpenEd maintain access to IEP/504 support.

## How to Register or File Homeschool Paperwork in Oregon

### For Traditional Homeschoolers

**Step 1: Find your ESD**
Oregon has 19 Education Service Districts. Find yours at [oaesd.org](https://www.oaesd.org/).

**Step 2: Submit notification**
Within 10 days of beginning homeschool, send a letter stating:
- Your intent to homeschool
- Your child's name and age
- Your address

Many ESDs have their own forms. Check your district's website or call them directly.

**Step 3: Keep your confirmation**
The ESD will acknowledge your notification. Keep this on file.

**Step 4: Complete required testing**
In grades 3, 5, 8, and 10, your child must take an approved standardized test. Results are for your records - not reported to the state.

### For Flexible Program Enrollment

If you enroll in OpenEd, Fossil DLP, or a similar program, they handle registration with the state. You'll complete their enrollment application instead.

| Curriculum (full year) | $300-$1,500 |
| Standardized testing | $25-$75 per test |
| Extracurriculars | Varies |
| Co-op fees | $0-$500/year |

## Can You Get Funding or Paid to Homeschool in Oregon?

**How it works:**
- OpenEd: Browse approved vendors, order what you need, no reimbursement required

### Tax Benefits

Oregon doesn't offer homeschool tax credits, but federal education tax benefits may apply if you're paying for certain educational expenses.

- [HSLDA](https://hslda.org/) for national options

## Oregon Parent Perspectives

### Brettani Shannon - Slow Mornings and AI-Powered Unit Studies

Brettani is an Oregon parent and founder of [Options for Education](https://www.optionsforeducation.com/). She homeschools her 9-year-old daughter Snow with a flexible, interest-led approach:

> "Our school day doesn't start until 10:00 AM. We spend weeks studying 'Pet Adoption' or 'Bigfoot.' Last week, we delayed our planned pioneer unit to remodel a bathroom together. This isn't a compromise. It's completely intentional."

Her advice for new homeschool parents:

> "The biggest mistake homeschool parents make is trying to replicate public school at home. Focus on relationships first - get to know your child, honor their unique passions, interests, strengths, and weaknesses."

### Charlynn Chambers - Year-Round Learning with Four Kids

Charlynn is an Oregon mom of four who transitioned from charter school to homeschooling, including children with ADHD:

> "I want my kids to be lifelong learners. I don't want them to feel like, 'Okay, school's over, the bell rang, we're done learning now.' At our house, there's just a constant attitude of we're always learning."

On making math work for her son with ADHD:

> "Division wasn't just numbers on a page; it was splitting Stormtrooper armies in Star Wars scenarios. Fractions weren't abstract concepts; they were measurements in a favorite recipe."

### Amanda Schenkenberger - Unschooling Success

Amanda, an Oregon homeschool coach, was featured on Fox News discussing her family's unschooling approach:

> "Unschooling is pursuing a level of learning and following my kids' lead to what they're curious about and diving deeply into the subject as long as their curiosity is alive."

Her boys take Oregon's required standardized tests and score in the top 10 percent nationally.

## FAQs About Homeschooling in Oregon

### Do I need to be a certified teacher to homeschool in Oregon?

No. Oregon has no teacher qualification requirements for homeschool parents.

### Can my homeschooled child participate in public school sports?

Yes. Oregon law allows homeschooled students to participate in interscholastic activities at their local public school, subject to the same eligibility requirements as enrolled students.

### How do I get a homeschool diploma in Oregon?

Oregon homeschool parents can issue their own diploma. There is no state-issued homeschool diploma. For college applications, maintain transcripts and document coursework.

### Is homeschooling legal in Oregon?

Yes. Homeschooling has been legal in Oregon since 1985.

### What's the difference between traditional homeschooling and enrolling in a flexible program?

Traditional homeschoolers operate independently - you notify the ESD, choose curriculum, and handle testing yourself.

Flexible programs (like OpenEd or Fossil DLP) provide support, funding, and handle administrative requirements. You're technically enrolled in a public school while educating at home.

Both let you learn at home with flexibility. The difference is support and funding.

### What if I start homeschooling and it doesn't work out?

You can return to public school at any time. If your child was enrolled in a flexible program, they handle the transition paperwork.

### Does OpenEd offer high school in Oregon?

OpenEd currently serves K-8 in Oregon. A high school program (grades 9-12) is launching in 2026-27. Fossil DLP has decided not to offer high school.

## Notes for Legal Review

**Melissa/Legal team:** Please review the following sections for accuracy:

1. **Registration requirements** (notification to ESD, 10-day window)
2. **Testing requirements** (grades 3, 5, 8, 10 - are exemptions available?)
3. **OpenEd vs Fossil comparison** - particularly the funding amounts and enrollment process differences
4. **Religious curriculum language** - we say Fossil "generally approves" religious curriculum; is this accurate?
5. **IEP/504 language** - claim that OpenEd maintains access to support
6. **High school timeline** - 2026-27 launch for OpenEd OR

The parent quotes are from published interviews and podcasts. The Fossil comparison data comes from Charlynn Chambers and Brettani Shannon (Oregon parent ambassadors).
