## 12. Content & Positioning Guidelines

### From OpenEd Style Guide

**Core Philosophy:**
- "No child is standard. Their education shouldn't be either."
- Education serves the child, not the system
- Parents are the primary architects
- The world is the classroom

**Voice:**
- Opinionated but helpful
- Clear over comprehensive
- Start with the problem
- End with actionable next steps

**The OpenEd Advantage (soft language for funding):**
> "Through public school partnerships, we provide: Funding that makes various educational approaches accessible"

### Key Positioning Notes

**On Identity (soft-pedal):**
- Don't say "you're not really homeschoolers"
- Emphasize: "You still educate at home with full flexibility"
- Frame as: "The easier path" not "the different path"

**On Reimbursement (be careful):**
- Landing page can be direct
- SEO content should be softer: "access educational resources" > "get reimbursed"
- Focus on "100% free" and "no cost to families"

**On Virtual Charter Comparison (VERIFIED):**
- Charter schools (Connections Academy, Oregon Charter Academy) do NOT require live attendance
- Both OpenEd and virtual charters are schedule-flexible
- **The real differentiator: CURRICULUM CHOICE**
  - Virtual charters: You use THEIR curriculum (Pearson, K12, etc.)
  - OpenEd: You choose YOUR OWN curriculum - mix & match from anywhere
- Safe framing: "Virtual schools provide their curriculum. With OpenEd, you design your child's education using any resources that work for your family."

### Existing OpenEd Oregon Assets
