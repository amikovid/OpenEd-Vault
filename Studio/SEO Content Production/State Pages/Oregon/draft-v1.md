## How to Start Homeschooling in Oregon

### Option 1: Traditional Homeschooling

If you want full control over every aspect of your child's education, traditional homeschooling lets you:

1. **Notify your local ESD** within 10 days of starting (find yours at [Oregon ESD Map](https://www.oaesd.org/))
2. **Choose your own curriculum** — or create your own
3. **Keep records** of instruction (recommended, not required)
4. **Complete state assessments** in grades 3, 5, 8, and 10

**Pros:** Maximum flexibility, complete curriculum control
**Cons:** You handle all the logistics yourself

### Option 2: Enroll in a Flexible Public Program

Several Oregon public programs support families who want to educate at home while accessing resources and support. These programs handle much of the administrative work—you focus on your child's learning.

When enrolled in one of these programs, you're technically a student of the school, which means different (often simpler) requirements. You still educate at home with the flexibility to choose what works for your family.

## Programs Available in Oregon

Oregon offers several flexible public programs for families who want to learn at home. Here's an honest comparison:

### Virtual Charter Schools

Programs like **Oregon Connections Academy**, **Oregon Charter Academy**, and **Cascade Virtual Academy** provide:
- Full online curriculum (you use their materials)
- Certified teachers
- Structured coursework
- Flexible scheduling (no live attendance required)
- Free (public school)

**Best for:** Families who want a complete, ready-made curriculum with teacher support.

### Flexible Choice Programs

Programs like **OpenEd** and **Fossil Distance Learning Program** offer a different approach:
- You choose your own curriculum from approved options
- Access to educational resources at no cost
- Dedicated support (Educational Specialist or Mentor Teacher)

**Best for:** Families who want to design a personalized education using resources that fit their child.

| Program | Grades | Curriculum | Key Feature |
|---------|--------|------------|-------------|
| [Oregon Connections Academy](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/oregon-online-school/) | K-12 | Provided (Pearson) | Full online school experience |
| [Oregon Charter Academy](https://www.oregoncharter.org/) | K-12 | Provided (Stride/K12) | Cognia accredited, 20+ years |

*Oregon high school program coming Fall 2026

**Note:** With flexible choice programs like OpenEd and Fossil DLP, you're paired with a certified teacher who provides guidance and support—you're not doing it alone. You still design your child's education, but you have professional backing when you need it.

<!-- TODO: Revisit this comparison once we have more specific differentiators between OpenEd and Fossil DLP. Currently very similar offerings. -->

## Oregon Homeschool Laws: What You Need to Know

### Notification Requirements

You must notify your local Education Service District (ESD) within 10 days of:
- The start of the school year, OR
- Withdrawing your child from public/private school

The notification is simple—just a letter stating you intend to homeschool. Many ESDs have their own forms.

**Find your ESD:** [Oregon Association of ESDs](https://www.oaesd.org/)

### Required Subjects

Oregon does not mandate specific subjects for homeschoolers. You have complete freedom to design your curriculum.

### Assessment Requirements

Oregon requires standardized testing in grades 3, 5, 8, and 10. You can choose from several approved tests, and the results are for your records—not reported to the state.

If your child scores below the 15th percentile, you may be asked to provide additional documentation, but this is rare.

### Recordkeeping

While not legally required, keeping records of your homeschool is strongly recommended:
- Attendance logs
- Work samples
- Curriculum used
- Test results

---

## Funding Your Education in Oregon

Oregon does not currently have a universal Education Savings Account (ESA) or voucher program for homeschoolers.

However, families enrolled in flexible public programs like OpenEd or Fossil DLP can access educational resources at no cost through their program's approved vendors and curriculum options.

<!-- Note: Avoid explicit "reimbursement" language. Focus on "access to resources at no cost" -->

## Oregon Parent Perspectives

### Brettani Shannon — Slow Mornings and AI-Powered Unit Studies

Brettani is an Oregon parent ambassador for OpenEd and founder of [Options for Education](https://www.optionsforeducation.com/), a nonprofit helping families navigate school choice. She homeschools her 9-year-old daughter Snow with a unique approach:

> "Our school day doesn't start until 10:00 AM. We spend weeks studying 'Pet Adoption' or 'Bigfoot.' Last week, we delayed our planned pioneer unit to remodel a bathroom together. This isn't a compromise. It's Open Education—and it's completely intentional."

Instead of packaged curriculum, Brettani uses AI tools like [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) to create custom unit studies based on her daughter's interests:

> "Snow loves animals. So, instead of just buying a biology textbook, I went to Perplexity and typed: 'Create a 4-day-a-week unit study for a 4th grader who loves animals. Focus on Pet Adoption. Give me book lists, movie suggestions, vocabulary words, and hands-on activities.'"

Her advice for new homeschool parents:

> "The biggest mistake homeschool parents make is trying to replicate public school at home. Focus on relationships first—get to know your child, honor their unique passions, interests, strengths, and weaknesses. Give them freedom of choice and buy-in to the experience."

### Charlynn Chambers — Year-Round Learning with Four Kids

Charlynn is an Oregon mom of four who transitioned from charter school to homeschooling, including children with ADHD. Her approach integrates learning into everyday life:

> "I want my kids to be lifelong learners. I don't want them to feel like, 'Okay, school's over, the bell rang, we're done learning now.' At our house, there's just a constant attitude of we're always learning. It doesn't matter if it's Saturday or if it's nighttime."

On making math click for her son with ADHD:

> "Division wasn't just numbers on a page; it was splitting Stormtrooper armies in Star Wars scenarios. Fractions weren't abstract concepts; they were measurements in a favorite recipe."

Her advice:

> "Be patient with yourself and realize it's going to change. It could be your kid's attitude, your curriculum choices, your schedule, your patience. Whatever it is, it's going to change. So you have to be willing to work with it and give yourself grace."

### Amanda Schenkenberger — Unschooling Success

Amanda, an OpenEd mom and homeschool coach in Oregon, was recently featured on Fox News discussing her family's unschooling approach:

> "Unschooling is pursuing a level of learning and following my kids' lead to what they're curious about and diving deeply into the subject as long as their curiosity is alive about it."

Her boys take Oregon's required standardized tests and score in the top 10 percent nationally.

> "When you allow your child to lead their learning, what they're being tested on does come along with this."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to be a certified teacher to homeschool in Oregon?

No. Oregon has no teacher qualification requirements for homeschool parents.

### Can my homeschooled child participate in public school sports?

Oregon law allows homeschooled students to participate in interscholastic activities at their local public school, subject to the same eligibility requirements as enrolled students. Contact your local district for specific policies.

### How do I get a homeschool diploma in Oregon?

Oregon homeschool parents can issue their own diploma. There is no state-issued homeschool diploma. For college applications, maintain transcripts and document coursework.

### Is homeschooling legal in Oregon?

### What's the difference between homeschooling and enrolling in a flexible public program?

Traditional homeschoolers operate independently—you notify the ESD, choose curriculum, and handle testing yourself.

Flexible public programs (like OpenEd or Fossil DLP) provide support, resources, and often handle administrative requirements. You're technically enrolled in a public school while educating at home. You're also paired with a certified teacher who can provide guidance, answer questions, and support your child's learning—while you remain the primary educator.

Both paths let you learn at home with flexibility. The right choice depends on how much support you want.

### Does OpenEd offer high school in Oregon?

Currently, OpenEd Oregon serves grades K-8. An Oregon high school program is coming Fall 2026. For high school students right now, consider Fossil Distance Learning Program or one of the virtual charter schools listed above.
