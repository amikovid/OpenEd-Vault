## How to Start Homeschooling in Utah

### Option 1: Traditional Homeschooling

If you want complete control over your child's education:

1. **File a notice of intent** with your local school board (one-time, per child)
2. **Receive your excuse certificate** within 30 days
3. **Choose your own curriculum** — or create your own
4. **Keep records** (recommended, not required)

That's it. No annual renewals. No testing. No portfolio reviews.

**Pros:** Maximum flexibility, zero oversight
**Cons:** You handle everything yourself

### Option 2: Enroll in a Flexible Public Program

Several Utah programs support families who want to educate at home while accessing resources and support:

When enrolled in programs like OpenEd, you're technically a student of an accredited school—which means OpenEd handles compliance paperwork. You still educate at home with full curriculum choice.

## Utah Homeschool Laws: What You Need to Know

### Notification Requirements

File a **one-time notice of intent** with your local school board for each child when you start homeschooling. Updated in May 2025—if you previously filed an affidavit, you don't need to refile.

Within 30 days, you'll receive an "excuse certificate" confirming your homeschool program. No annual renewals required.

### Required Subjects

### Assessment Requirements

None. No standardized testing. No portfolio reviews. No reporting to the state.

### Recordkeeping

Not legally required, but strongly recommended:
- Attendance logs
- Work samples
- Curriculum used
- Reading lists

### Public School Access

Utah law explicitly allows homeschoolers to participate in public school activities:

- **Sports:** Eligible for extracurricular activities at your local public school
- **Classes:** "Dual enrollment" lets you take specific classes (like chemistry lab or band) while homeschooling
- **Programs:** Access to public school resources subject to same eligibility as enrolled students

Districts cannot impose additional requirements on homeschoolers beyond what enrolled students face.
