### THE PROOF: Real Numbers from a Real Campus

**Apogee Campus Example - 2025 Results:** 

* 
**Revenue:** $618,294 


* 
**Net Profit:** $383,508 


* 
**Operating Margin:** 62% 


* With uncapped growth potential 



This wasn't luck. This is a system. 

### WHY MOST MICROSCHOOLS FAIL (And Why You Won't)

95% of people who want to start a microschool never launch because they spend years trying to build credibility, overcomplicate the model, or waste money on the wrong tools.

**Your Advantages:** 

* Parents already trust you 


* Leadership credibility worth $100K+ in marketing 


* A proven playbook 


* Starting at "mile 5 in a 10-mile race"
