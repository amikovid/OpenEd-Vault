## Topic Angle - NEEDS SEO RESEARCH

**Her expertise areas:**
- Reading instruction
- Dyslexia (personal experience)
- Book recommendations
- Literacy for struggling readers
- School librarian perspective

**Potential angles:**
- "Signs your child might have dyslexia"
- "How to teach reading at home"
- "Best books for reluctant readers"
- "When to worry about reading development"

**NOTE:** We've done a lot on dyslexia already. Need to find something MORE on-brand with Everyday Reading that has high SEO intent.

**Run SEO research to find:**
- Gaps in our literacy content
- High-intent keywords she could own
- Slightly controversial angles (reading wars? phonics vs whole language?)
