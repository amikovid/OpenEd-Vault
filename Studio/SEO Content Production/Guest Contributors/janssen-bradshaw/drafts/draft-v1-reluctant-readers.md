# Books for Reluctant Readers: What Actually Works (From a Librarian Mom of 4)

My oldest daughter tested at a 12th-grade reading level in kindergarten. I figured this is just what happens when you're a librarian, your house has somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books in it, and you've been reading aloud every single night since your kid was born.

Then my second daughter came along. Same house. Same books. Same read-alouds and library trips. And by first grade, her teacher sat us down and said she was barely at grade level - the very lowest they could call "at grade level" - and she was drifting lower with every assessment.

I have four daughters. They all grew up surrounded by books. They've had wildly different relationships with reading. And after nearly 20 years as a librarian, blogger, and homeschool mom, I can tell you this: there is no one path to raising a reader. But there are things that actually work - and things that don't - when you have a kid who just doesn't want to pick up a book.

## First: It Might Not Be About the Books

I know this is an article about books for reluctant readers, and I promise we'll get there. But I've learned (sometimes the hard way) that the books themselves are only part of the equation.

If reading feels like a chore, punishment, or homework, no book list in the world is going to fix that. Before you worry about which books to hand your kid, it's worth asking a few questions:

**Is reading a power struggle in your house?** If every reading session ends in tears or an argument, the first step is to take the pressure way down. I have never seen a child forced into loving books. Read aloud to them instead. Let them listen to audiobooks. Just keep books positive and present, and stop insisting they read independently for a while.

**Are screens crowding out reading time?** This is the number one thing my readers tell me makes a difference. I'm not anti-screen - I make my living on my phone - but if a kid has unlimited access to YouTube and video games, a book is going to feel slow by comparison. You don't have to eliminate screens. You just have to create some space where books are the most interesting option available.

**Could there be something else going on?** My second daughter wasn't being lazy or difficult. Learning to read was genuinely hard for her brain. She's extremely bright, but decoding wasn't clicking. If your child is resistant to reading AND struggling with the mechanics - mixing up letters, guessing at words, unable to remember what they just read - it might be worth getting an assessment. More on that at the end.

## What Actually Helps Reluctant Readers (Before You Pick a Single Book)

These are the strategies I come back to again and again, both as a parent and as someone who's been recommending books to families for nearly two decades.

**1. Read aloud to them.** This is the easiest, most powerful thing you can do. When you read aloud, your kid gets the story, the vocabulary, and the emotional experience of a great book without having to do the hard work of decoding. It keeps the association between books and pleasure alive. My mom read aloud to me through high school - we'd sit together with two copies of *Pride and Prejudice* and take turns page by page. I read aloud to my girls every night and they do LEGOs, braid my hair, paint their nails, or just lie on the floor. The activity keeps their hands busy and honestly, they sit still longer.

**2. Let audiobooks count.** There's no book police. No one's coming to audit how many physical books your child reads versus how many they listen to. Kids can listen to stories at a much higher level than they can read independently, which means audiobooks give them access to the good stuff - complex plots, rich vocabulary, books they'd never attempt on their own. I LOVE audiobooks for reluctant readers. Some favorites for younger kids: the Mercy Watson series read by Ron McLarty, Frog and Toad, and anything by Beverly Cleary. For older kids: *The One and Only Ivan* and *Percy Jackson* are fantastic on audio.

**3. Let them read "junk food" books.** Captain Underpants counts. Dog Man counts. Graphic novels absolutely count. If your kid is willing to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid for the forty-seventh time, that's forty-seven times they practiced reading voluntarily. The goal is fluency and a positive association with books. You can broaden their taste later. Right now, the fact that they're reading at all is the win.

**4. Create a reading window, not a reading assignment.** Don't say "read for 20 minutes." Say "it's reading time" and everyone reads - you included. Our family does this after dinner most nights. The kids can read whatever they want. I read my own book. There's no timer, no log, no questions afterward. If they only read for seven minutes before they drift off, that's fine. The habit matters more than the minutes.

**5. Read the first few chapters together.** The beginning of a book is always the hardest part - you're meeting new characters, figuring out the world, trying to care about people you don't know yet. I'll often read the first three or four chapters aloud to one of my girls, then hand the book over and say "let me know what happens." Once they're hooked, they don't need me anymore.

## Books That Actually Work for Reluctant Readers (By Age)

Now for the fun part. These are books I've personally seen work with kids who say they hate reading. Not every book will click with every kid - that's the nature of it - but these have the highest success rate of anything I recommend.

### Ages 5-7: Keep It Visual and Fun

At this age, reluctant reading is usually about the mechanics being hard. These books meet kids where they are.

- **I Spy books** (Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick) - No reading required. A child can lose themselves in these for an hour without decoding a single word. For a kid who feels behind, this is a huge relief - they're "doing a book" without the stress.
- **Elephant & Piggie series** (Mo Willems) - Short, funny, and the dialogue is in speech bubbles, so it feels more like a comic than a chapter book. My girls have all loved these.
- **Dog Man** (Dav Pilkey) - Yes, it's ridiculous. That's the point. The humor is irresistible for this age, and the graphic novel format means big pictures and small amounts of text on every page.
- **Press Here** (Herve Tullet) - Interactive and physical. The kid is the one making the book work. Great for kids who need to move.

### Ages 7-10: The Bridge Years

This is where a lot of kids stall out. They can read, technically, but it's still hard enough that it doesn't feel fun yet. The key is finding books where the story pulls them forward faster than the reading slows them down.

- **The Last Kids on Earth series** (Max Brallier) - Illustrated, fast-paced, funny, and about the apocalypse. I have never met a 9-year-old boy who could resist this series.
- **Wings of Fire graphic novels** (Tui T. Sutherland) - If your kid won't touch the chapter book versions, these graphic adaptations are excellent. Once they're invested in the dragons, some kids do cross over to the prose novels.
- **Diary of a Wimpy Kid** (Jeff Kinney) - The book that launched a thousand reluctant readers. It looks like a diary, it's full of drawings, and it's genuinely funny. Let them read it. Let them reread it. It's working.
- **Hilo series** (Judd Winick) - Graphic novels with real plot, real stakes, and a lot of heart. My girls tore through these.
- **The Wild Robot** (Peter Brown) - Short chapters, a compelling main character (a robot stranded on an island), and a story that sneaks up on you emotionally. This is the book I hand to parents who say "my 8-year-old won't read anything."

### Ages 10-13: When They'd Rather Watch YouTube

At this age, you're often competing with screens and social pressure. The books that work here tend to be fast, high-interest, or genuinely shocking in some way.

- **Refugee** (Alan Gratz) - Three stories, three time periods, short chapters that alternate between them. The pacing is relentless. I've watched kids who "don't read" tear through this in two days.
- **Ghost** (Jason Reynolds) - Athletic, real, and written in a voice that sounds like an actual kid. The whole Track series is great for reluctant readers.
- **Hatchet** (Gary Paulsen) - Survival story. Boy alone in the wilderness with a hatchet. It's been hooking reluctant readers for 40 years and it still works.
- **Restart** (Gordon Korman) - A bully falls off a roof, loses his memory, and has to decide who he wants to be. My girls' friends who "don't read" have all read this one.
- **All Thirteen** (Christina Soontornvat) - The Thai cave rescue, told in narrative nonfiction. I have gotten more positive feedback about this book than any other in 15 years of blogging. There is no book I recommend more confidently for readers age 10 and up. It reads like a thriller and it's all true.
- **Murdle Jr.** (G.T. Karber) - Not a traditional book - it's a puzzle-solving mystery where the reader is the detective. For a kid who thinks books are boring, this changes the equation entirely.

### Teens: Pick Your Battles

I'm going to be honest: if your teenager doesn't want to read, pushing harder is almost certainly going to backfire. The best things you can do are keep books visible, keep reading aloud (yes, even to a 16-year-old - my mom did this and it worked), and suggest rather than assign.

- **The Martian** (Andy Weir) - Funny, science-heavy, and it reads like a blog. Teens who hate fiction often love this because it doesn't feel like a "school book."
- **The Hunger Games** (Suzanne Collins) - Still the gold standard for pulling teens into reading. If they haven't read it, it's worth a shot.
- **Long Way Down** (Jason Reynolds) - Written in verse. The whole book takes place in a 60-second elevator ride. You can read it in an hour. It's devastating.
- **Unbroken (Young Adult Adaptation)** (Laura Hillenbrand) - True story, incredible pacing, and it's adapted specifically to be accessible without losing the power.

## When Great Books Aren't Enough

I want to circle back to something I mentioned at the beginning, because it's important.

Some kids resist reading not because they haven't found the right book, but because the act of reading is genuinely difficult for them. The decoding part - turning letters into sounds into words into meaning - hasn't clicked yet, and no amount of great book recommendations will solve that. I know this firsthand because it was exactly what happened with my second daughter.

What finally made the difference for her was consistent, short, one-on-one practice with someone who wasn't me. Twenty-five minutes a day, four days a week, working on phonics and decoding with a trained reading coach. I remember the summer she started - she got out of the swimming pool mid-swim to go do her session without a single complaint. That's when I knew something was different.

She went from barely at grade level in first grade to testing at an 11th-grade reading level by fifth grade. A couple of years ago, someone asked me if it embarrassed her that I talk about her reading struggles publicly. So I asked her. She looked at me and said, "Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

That experience is actually why my husband and I started [Savvy Reading](https://savvylearning.com) - an online reading tutoring program built on the science of reading. It's live, small-group or one-on-one sessions, 25 minutes a day, four days a week. Not every reluctant reader needs this kind of help. But if your child is struggling with the mechanics and not just the motivation, the best book list in the world won't get them there without the foundational skills to actually read it. A reading assessment can help you figure out which category your kid falls into - and [Savvy offers a free one](https://savvylearning.com) if you want to check.

## The Real Goal

Here's what I come back to after all these years. The goal isn't raising a kid who reads 50 books a year or who finishes every classic by age 12. The goal is a kid who knows that books exist, that they're enjoyable, and that reading is something worth doing.

Some kids get there at six. Some kids get there at sixteen. Some kids need graphic novels and audiobooks and a patient parent reading aloud for years before they pick up a chapter book on their own. All of that is fine.

Keep books around. Keep reading aloud. Keep it fun. And if your kid picks up a book this week - even Dog Man, even for seven minutes - that counts.

It all counts.
