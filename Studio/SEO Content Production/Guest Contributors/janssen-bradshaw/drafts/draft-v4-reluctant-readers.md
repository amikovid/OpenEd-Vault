# Books for Reluctant Readers: What Actually Works (From a Librarian Mom of 4)

*Janssen Bradshaw is a former elementary school librarian turned homeschool mom of four, the voice behind [Everyday Reading](https://everyday-reading.com) (where she's been recommending books to over 600,000 followers for 15+ years), and the co-founder of [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com), an online reading tutoring program built on the science of reading. She knows more about getting kids to love books than almost anyone we've met - and she'll be the first to tell you it doesn't always go the way you'd expect. She joined us on [the OpenEd Podcast](https://opened.co/blog/child-struggling-to-read-what-actually-works) to talk about her family's reading journey.*

My oldest daughter tested at a 12th-grade reading level in kindergarten. I figured, okay, this is what happens when you're a librarian with somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books in your house and you've been reading aloud every night since your kid was born.

Then my second daughter came along. She grew up in the same house, surrounded by the same books, with the same nightly read-alouds and weekly library trips. And by first grade, her teacher sat us down and said she was barely at grade level - the very lowest they could call "at grade level" - and she was drifting lower with every assessment.

I have four daughters. They all grew up surrounded by books. They've had wildly different relationships with reading. And after nearly 20 years as a librarian, blogger, and homeschool mom, I can tell you this: there is no one path to raising a reader. But there are things that work and things that don't when you have a kid who just doesn't want to pick up a book.

## First: It Might Not Be About the Books

I know this is an article about books for reluctant readers, and I promise we'll get there. But I've learned (sometimes the hard way) that the books themselves are only part of the equation.

If reading feels like a chore or a punishment or homework, no book list in the world is going to fix that. Before you worry about which books to hand your kid, it's worth asking a few questions:

**Is reading a power struggle in your house?** If every reading session ends in tears or an argument, the first step is to take the pressure way down. I have never seen a child forced into loving books. Read aloud to them instead. Let them listen to audiobooks. Just keep books positive and present, and stop insisting they read independently for a while.

**Are screens crowding out reading time?** This is the number one thing my readers tell me makes a difference. I'm not anti-screen - I make my living on my phone - but if a kid has unlimited access to YouTube and video games, a book is going to feel slow by comparison. You don't have to eliminate screens. You just have to create some space where books are the most interesting option available. (OpenEd has a great piece on [why kids lose their love of learning](https://opened.co/blog/why-kids-lose-their-love-of-learning-and-how-to-prevent-it) that gets at this.)

**Could there be something else going on?** My second daughter wasn't being lazy or difficult. Learning to read was hard for her brain in a way it wasn't hard for her sisters. She's extremely bright, but the mechanics of turning letters into sounds into words just weren't clicking. If your child is resistant to reading AND struggling with the mechanics - mixing up letters, guessing at words, unable to remember what they just read - it might be worth [getting an assessment](https://opened.co/blog/the-homeschool-parents-guide-to-dyslexia-when-to-diy-vs-when-to-call-the-experts). More on that at the end.

## How to Help Reluctant Readers (Before You Pick a Single Book)

These are the strategies I come back to again and again, both as a parent and as someone who's been recommending books to families for nearly two decades.

**1. Read aloud to them.** This is the single most powerful thing you can do. When you read aloud, your kid gets the story, the vocabulary, and the emotional experience of a great book without having to struggle through the words. It keeps the association between books and pleasure alive. My mom read aloud to me through high school - we'd sit together with two copies of *Pride and Prejudice* and take turns page by page. I read aloud to my daughters every night and they do LEGOs, braid my hair, paint their nails, or just lie on the floor. The activity keeps their hands busy and honestly, they sit still longer.

**2. Let audiobooks count.** There's no book police. No one's coming to audit how many physical books your child reads versus how many they listen to. Kids can listen to stories at a much higher level than they can read independently, which means audiobooks give them access to the good stuff - complex plots, rich vocabulary, books they'd never attempt on their own. I LOVE audiobooks for reluctant readers. Some favorites for younger kids: the Mercy Watson series read by Ron McLarty, Frog and Toad, and anything by Beverly Cleary. For older kids: The One and Only Ivan and Percy Jackson are fantastic on audio.

**3. Let them read "junk food" books.** Captain Underpants counts. Dog Man counts. If your kid is willing to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid for the forty-seventh time, that's forty-seven times they practiced reading voluntarily. The goal is fluency and a positive association with books. You can broaden their taste later. Right now, the fact that they're reading at all is the win.

**4. Create a reading window, not a reading assignment.** Don't say "read for 20 minutes." Say "it's reading time" and everyone reads - you included. Our family does this after dinner most nights. The kids can read whatever they want. I read my own book. There's no timer, no log, no questions afterward. If they only read for seven minutes before they drift off, that's fine. The habit matters more than the minutes.

**5. Read the first few chapters together.** The beginning of a book is always the hardest part - you're meeting new characters, figuring out the world, trying to care about people you don't know yet. I'll often read the first three or four chapters aloud to one of my daughters, then hand the book over and say "let me know what happens." Once they're hooked, they don't need me anymore.

## The Best Books for Reluctant Readers (By Age)

Now for the fun part. These are books I've personally seen work with kids who say they hate reading. Not every book will click with every kid - that's the nature of it - but these have the highest success rate of anything I recommend.

### Ages 5-7: Keep It Visual and Fun

At this age, reluctant reading is usually about the mechanics being hard. These books meet kids where they are.

- **I Spy books** (Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick) - No reading required. A child can lose themselves in these for an hour without sounding out a single word. For a kid who feels behind, that's a huge relief - they're "doing a book" without any stress.
- **Dog Man** (Dav Pilkey) - Yes, it's ridiculous. That's the point. The humor is irresistible for this age, and the graphic novel format means big pictures and small amounts of text on every page. I wrote an entire post of 25 books like Dog Man because parents kept asking me what to hand their kids next.
- **Narwhal and Jelly** (Ben Clanton) - A narwhal and a jellyfish become best friends. It's a graphic novel, it's funny, and kids who won't touch a chapter book will pick this up over and over. The series keeps going and kids want every one.
- **Frog and Toad** (Arnold Lobel) - Short stories about two friends. Each one is a few pages. The language is simple, the stories are genuinely sweet, and these have been working for 50 years. Also fantastic as audiobooks.

### Ages 7-10: The Bridge Years

This is where a lot of kids stall out. They can read, technically, but it's still hard enough that it doesn't feel fun yet. The key is finding books where the story pulls them forward faster than the reading slows them down.

- **Bad Guys** (Aaron Blabey) - A wolf, a shark, a piranha, and a snake try to become heroes. Sixteen books, each one about 144 pages with tons of illustrations. Kids tear through these and immediately want the next one.
- **Diary of a Wimpy Kid** (Jeff Kinney) - The book that launched a thousand reluctant readers. It looks like a diary, it's full of drawings, and kids find it hilarious. Let them read it. Let them reread it. It's working.
- **InvestiGators** (John Patrick Green) - Two alligator detectives who travel through the sewer system. It's as weird as it sounds and kids are obsessed. The series keeps growing and each book is fully illustrated.
- **Hilo series** (Judd Winick) - My oldest tore through these in a week. Real plot, real emotional stakes, and the kind of cliffhangers that make kids grab the next book off the shelf.
- **The Wild Robot** (Peter Brown) - This is the book I hand to parents who say "my 8-year-old won't read anything." Short chapters, a robot stranded on a wild island, and a story that will make you cry before you realize what happened. The movie brought a lot of new readers to this one.

### Ages 10-13: When They'd Rather Watch YouTube

At this age, you're often competing with screens and social pressure. The books that work here tend to be the ones that grab kids by page three and don't let go.

- **I Survived series** (Lauren Tarshis) - Each book is about 112 pages and drops a kid into a real historical disaster - the Titanic, a hurricane, a shark attack. Short, fast, and there are dozens of them, so once a kid is hooked they have a long runway.
- **Hatchet** (Gary Paulsen) - Boy alone in the Canadian wilderness with a hatchet. It's been hooking reluctant readers for 40 years and it still works.
- **Encyclopedia Brown** (Donald J. Sobol) - Each chapter is its own mystery and the reader gets to solve it before the answer is revealed. For a kid who thinks books are boring, this format changes everything - they're not just reading, they're competing.
- **All Thirteen** (Christina Soontornvat) - The Thai cave rescue, told as narrative nonfiction. I have gotten more positive feedback about this book than almost any other in 15 years of blogging. It reads like a thriller and it's all true.
- **Murdle Jr.** (G.T. Karber) - Not a traditional book. It's a puzzle-solving mystery where the reader is the detective. I also love the Cluedle series by Hartigan Browne in the same vein. For a kid who thinks books are boring, hand them one of these.

### Teens: Pick Your Battles

If your teenager doesn't want to read, pushing harder is almost certainly going to backfire. The best things you can do are keep books visible, keep reading aloud (yes, even to a 16-year-old - my mom did this and it worked), and suggest rather than assign.

- **The Hunger Games** (Suzanne Collins) - Still the gold standard for pulling teens into reading. If they haven't read it, it's worth a shot.
- **Scythe** (Neal Shusterman) - In a world where disease and war have been eliminated, someone still has to manage the population. The premise hooks teens immediately and the moral questions keep them reading. This is one I recommend to boys who say they don't like fiction.
- **Ready Player One** (Ernest Cline) - A massive Easter egg hunt inside a virtual reality world. For teens who spend all their time gaming, this is the book that speaks their language.
- **Fablehaven** (Brandon Mull) - Two siblings discover their grandparents' property is a secret preserve for magical creatures. Five books, each one pulls you deeper. I've watched so many teen reluctant readers get hooked on this series.

## When Great Books Aren't Enough

Some kids resist reading not because they haven't found the right book, but because the act of reading is hard for their brain in a way it isn't for other kids. The mechanics of it - turning letters into sounds into words into meaning - haven't clicked, and no book list is going to solve that on its own. I know this because it was exactly what happened with my second daughter.

What made the difference for her was consistent, short, one-on-one practice with someone who wasn't me. Twenty-five minutes a day, four days a week, working on [phonics with a trained reading coach](https://opened.co/blog/dispelling-dyslexia-myths-with-the-science-of-reading). I remember the summer she started - she got out of the swimming pool mid-swim to go do her session without a single complaint. That's when I knew something was different.

She went from barely at grade level in first grade to testing at an 11th-grade reading level by fifth grade. A couple of years ago, someone asked me if it embarrassed her that I talk about her reading struggles publicly. So I asked her. She looked at me and said, "Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

That experience is why my husband and I started [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com) - an online reading tutoring program built on the science of reading. It's live, small-group or one-on-one sessions, 25 minutes a day, four days a week. Not every reluctant reader needs this kind of help. But if your child is struggling with the mechanics and not just the motivation, the best book list in the world won't get them there without the foundational skills. [Savvy offers a free reading assessment](https://savvylearning.com) if you want to figure out which category your kid falls into.

## The Real Goal

I want my kids to grow up knowing that books exist, that they're enjoyable, and that reading is something worth doing. Whether they read 50 books a year or five, that's the part that matters.

Some kids get there at six. Some kids get there at sixteen. Some kids need graphic novels and audiobooks and a patient parent reading aloud for years before they pick up a chapter book on their own. All of that is fine.

Keep books around. Read aloud as long as they'll let you. And if your kid picks up a book this week - even Dog Man, even for seven minutes - it counts.
