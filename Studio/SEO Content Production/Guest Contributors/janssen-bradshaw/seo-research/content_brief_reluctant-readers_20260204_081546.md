Use this section to intentionally cover gaps or add unique value beyond the top-ranking pages.

Potential missing angles (related keywords not reflected in competitor headings):

- reluctant readers books _(vol: 480)_
- books for reluctant readers age 12 _(vol: 40)_
- books for reluctant readers age 10 _(vol: 40)_
- books for reluctant readers adults _(vol: 10)_
- books for reluctant readers high school

Other practical differentiators to consider:

- Add a clear definition + quick summary at top (snippet-friendly).
- Include a worked example, template, or checklist readers can copy.
- Address common misconceptions and edge cases competitors skip.
- Add an FAQ section mapped directly to People Also Ask-style questions.

## Notes / Limitations

- Competitor scraping is best-effort and may miss headings on JS-heavy sites.
- Metrics come from DataForSEO and may vary by location/device.
