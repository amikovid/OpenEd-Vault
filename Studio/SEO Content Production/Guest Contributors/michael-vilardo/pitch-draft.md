# Pitch to Michael Vilardo

## Context
His TEDx talk "It's About to Get Uncomfortable" has 65K views but hasn't been turned into a written article. The Authority Magazine piece is Q&A format - not the same impact as a proper article.

## Draft Email

**Subject:** Publishing your TED talk as an article on OpenEd

Hi Michael,

I caught your TEDxSantaCruz talk and thought the "Netflix of education" framing was compelling - especially the bit about how we're still running schools on the Prussian factory model while kids are learning calculus from YouTube.

I noticed you haven't turned that talk into a written piece. We'd love to publish it on OpenEd's platform (60K+ homeschool families) with full credit and links back to Subject.

Two options:
1. **We ghostwrite it** - I'd turn your transcript into an 1,200-word article, you approve before we publish
2. **You write it** - We provide the outline and SEO keywords, you write or adapt

Either way, we'd promote it to our newsletter list and social channels. Subject gets exposure to families actively looking for high school options.

Interested?

Best,
[Name]
OpenEd

## Article Angles (if he's interested)

**Option A: "The Netflix of High School" (Disruptive)**
- His signature concept from the TED talk
- Controversial angle on broken traditional model
- Subject.com prominently featured

**Option B: "Online High School Options" (SEO)**
- Broader guide with Subject as featured option
- Keywords: "accredited online high school", "virtual high school"
- Less controversial, more educational

**Option C: "First-Gen to Founder" (Personal Story)**
- His journey: 7 schools, first Ivy League grad from town
- More inspirational, less SEO-focused

**Recommendation:** Option A - most authentic to his voice and the TED talk content.
