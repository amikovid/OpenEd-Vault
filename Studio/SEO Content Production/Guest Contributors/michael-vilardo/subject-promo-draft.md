### High School Just Got a Lot More Flexible

One question we get constantly: *"What do I do when my kids hit high school?"*

Traditional homeschool curriculum gets harder to pull off. Transcripts matter. Accreditation matters. And honestly? Teaching AP Chemistry yourself isn't for everyone.

**Subject.com** is solving this. They offer 100+ accredited high school courses - everything from Algebra to AP Psychology - that your student can take on their own schedule.

A few things that stood out to us:
- **Actually accredited** (Cognia) - transcripts colleges recognize
- **Self-paced** - start anytime, finish when ready
- **Video-first** - built for how students actually learn
- **ESA-friendly** - accepted by most state programs

The founder, Michael Vilardo, has a story that resonates: he attended 7 different schools in 5 years growing up, became his town's first Ivy League graduate, and built Subject to give other kids the flexibility he wished he'd had.
