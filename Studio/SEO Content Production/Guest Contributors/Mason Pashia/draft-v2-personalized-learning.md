# What Personalized Learning Actually Looks Like (From Families Already Doing It)

I recently spent a few months writing speculative fiction about a high school student in 2040. Her name was Jamie. She had an AI assistant called Scout that mapped her learning across the city - architecture mentorships downtown, a science lab in a repurposed building, credentials stacking in a digital wallet. Her grandmother took piano lessons on the same system. The city was the classroom, and the learning was completely unbundled.

It was a fun thought experiment. I was pretty proud of it, actually. And then I started talking to families in ESA states and realized... a lot of this is already happening. Not all of it - nobody has bioluminescent streetlights or autonomous school trams yet - but the underlying model? Families assembling personalized learning experiences from real-world parts, funded by public dollars, tracked through portable records? That's 2026. Right now.

So what does personalized learning actually look like when families are the ones building it?

## It Doesn't Look Like Adaptive Software

When most people in education talk about personalized learning, they mean adaptive software inside a classroom. A program that adjusts question difficulty based on how a student did on the last ten problems. That version has been around for a decade-plus, and, frankly, the results have been mixed.

But there's another version that starts not with software but with families making choices. And it looks completely different.

A parent in Utah selects a math curriculum from one provider, a writing program from another, science through a local co-op, and art from a community studio. An eight-year-old in Indiana spends mornings on an adaptive math platform at home and afternoons at a nature program run by a retired biologist. A teenager in Iowa builds a portfolio through mentorships, online courses, and project-based work - all rolling up into an accredited transcript through programs like OpenEd, which operates across nine states.

None of these families are following a program designed by a district curriculum committee. They're assembling something from available parts, tailored to a specific kid. If that's not personalized learning in its most literal form, I'm not sure what is.

And here's what gets interesting from a cost perspective: microschools and hybrid homeschool models are pulling this off at $7,000 to $14,000 per student. Traditional district per-pupil spending runs $15,000 to $20,000+ in most states. Families are building something more tailored for less money. The old logic assumed personalization required *more* resources, not fewer. Turns out, when you remove the overhead of a building, a bus fleet, and a centralized administration, the economics shift in ways most policy conversations haven't caught up with.

## Three Things That Made This Possible

This didn't happen by accident. Three shifts converged over the last five years, and they're worth naming.

**1. Funding went directly to families.** Education Savings Accounts now exist in some form in over 17 states. The mechanisms vary - some universal, some income-limited, some restricted to specific categories - but the principle is consistent: public education dollars follow the student, and families decide how to spend them. This is what I've been calling the shift from scarcity to abundance in education. The scarcity model assumes one school, one curriculum, one path, limited seats. The abundance model assumes families can access many options and assemble what works. ESA expansion is the funding infrastructure that makes that possible.

**2. Curriculum unbundled.** As Ron Matus, Director of Research at Step Up For Students, shared in a recent conversation with Michael Horn: "There are districts that are seeing the times have changed. Some families don't want our whole package deal. They just want some of the pieces." Districts in several states have started offering a la carte learning options - single classes, electives, or resources that families can plug into broader, personalized learning pathways. Programs like DaVinci Connect and Homeschool Connect are turning underutilized school facilities into community learning hubs. Meanwhile, the independent curriculum market has exploded. A family can choose Saxon Math for structure, a Charlotte Mason approach for literature, and a project-based science program - all from different providers, all running in parallel. It's the education equivalent of what happened to media. You don't subscribe to one network anymore. You assemble your own bundle.

**3. AI became connective tissue.** When you're pulling curriculum from four providers, tracking progress across three learning environments, and trying to identify gaps before they become problems, you need something holding the picture together. AI recommendation engines, adaptive platforms, and progress-tracking tools are filling that role. They're rudimentary compared to the Scout I imagined for Jamie in 2040, but the function is the same: helping a learner and their family see the whole landscape and make better choices within it. As Dr. Yong Zhao has put it, the goal of AI in education is not "to help all students achieve the same outcomes" but "to help each student to become uniquely great in their own way." That's personalized learning as a philosophy, not just a product.

The people behind these systems - I've borrowed Reid Hoffman's framework and called them Bloomers - saw abundance where others saw risk. They didn't wait for permission from a centralized system. They built alternatives and let families choose.

## A Day in the Life, 2026 Edition

Here's a composite drawn from families in ESA states. It's not fictional (unlike my 2040 version, though I liked that one too).

Morning. A ten-year-old works through a math lesson on an adaptive platform at the kitchen table. The platform adjusts based on where she got stuck yesterday. Her mom reviews the progress dashboard over coffee - fractions are clicking, measurement still needs work.

Late morning. They drive to a co-op meetup at a community center. Eight kids from different families work on a group engineering project, building a scale model bridge. A parent with a civil engineering background volunteers as facilitator. The kids range from age 8 to 13. Nobody is sorting by grade level.

Afternoon. The ten-year-old has a video call with a writing tutor who helps her shape a personal essay about her family's backyard garden into an argument about local food systems. This goes into her portfolio.

Her mom, meanwhile, is working through an online bookkeeping course on the same platform that hosts some of her daughter's curriculum. She's building toward a credential she can use for freelance work.

Everything the daughter does rolls up into an accredited transcript. The co-op hours, the tutoring sessions, the adaptive math, the portfolio work - all documented, all counting toward graduation.

I keep thinking about the parallels to Jamie's 2040 day. The AI assistant is a progress dashboard instead of a conversational agent. The "city as classroom" is a community center and a kitchen table instead of repurposed downtown buildings. The multigenerational learning is a mom doing bookkeeping while her daughter does math, not a grandmother taking piano on a unified city platform.

The differences are real. But the model is the same.

[NOTE FOR MASON: If you have a specific family or program you've visited that fits this pattern, we'd love to swap in a real story here. Real names and details will make this section land much harder. OpenEd can also connect you with families if that's helpful.]

## What We Haven't Figured Out

I'd be dishonest if I painted this as a solved problem. A few gaps are real and worth naming, and they map to concerns I've heard from edleaders across the spectrum.

**The equity question.** The families assembling personalized learning pathways right now tend to be resourced, informed, and connected. They know how to find providers, evaluate curriculum, and manage a complex schedule. ESA funding helps with the money piece, but it doesn't solve discovery or support. A single parent working two jobs doesn't have the bandwidth to research fifteen curriculum options and coordinate co-op schedules. Until personalized learning is as easy to access as enrolling in a neighborhood school, it will remain concentrated among families with the time and knowledge to build it. This is the Bloomer challenge - moving forward with both optimism *and* caution, making sure that innovation doesn't just serve the already-served.

**Credential portability.** A portfolio of real-world projects and verified skills is arguably more meaningful than a GPA. But employers and colleges still want transcripts, and not all transcripts are treated equally. The digital learner wallet I imagined for 2040 - where credentials from any source are portable, verified, and universally recognized - is technically possible today through Learner Employment Records and digital credentialing standards. It's just not widely adopted. We're seeing organizations around the globe pilot and begin codifying these infrastructures, but it's moving slowly.

**The imagination gap.** This one might be the biggest barrier. Most people still picture "school" as a building with classrooms, a principal, and a bell schedule. When you describe what personalized learning families are actually doing, the response is often some version of "But where do they *go*?" Until the mental model of what education can look like shifts at a broader scale, these approaches stay on the margins. As we wrote in our *Blogs from the Future* series: "We are living in someone's imagined future. To build differently, we first have to imagine a better one."

## Building, Not Waiting

In the spirit of that imagination work, I want to return to where I started. I spent a few months writing about what education *could* look like if we let go of old constraints - fixed buildings, fixed schedules, fixed funding streams, fixed age cohorts. I built an imaginary world set in 2040 to make the case that something better was possible.

What I've learned since is that the families actually doing this didn't need the thought experiment. They needed the funding, the curriculum options, and a system willing to count what their kids were learning. In a growing number of states, they have all three.

What if personalized learning isn't a product that a school installs? What if it's what happens when families get real funding, real choices, and a system that actually tracks what their kids are doing? What if the infrastructure we've been waiting for... already exists, assembled from the bottom up by the families themselves?

The future of personalized learning is a ten-year-old doing adaptive math at a kitchen table, building a bridge at a co-op, and writing about her garden with a tutor - all before dinner. And her mom, studying alongside her, because the system finally lets her.

Some families are already there. The rest of us are catching up.
