# What Personalized Learning Actually Looks Like (From Families Already Doing It)

I recently spent a few months writing speculative fiction about a high school student in 2040. Her name was Jamie. She had an AI assistant called Scout that mapped her learning across the city - architecture mentorships downtown, a science lab in a repurposed building, credentials stacking in a digital wallet. Her grandmother took piano lessons on the same system. The city was the classroom, and the learning was completely unbundled.

It was a fun thought experiment. I was pretty proud of it, actually. And then I started talking to families and realized... a lot of this is already happening. Not all of it - nobody has bioluminescent streetlights or autonomous school trams yet - but the underlying model? Families assembling personalized learning from a mix of sources - public school classes, online curricula, co-ops, mentorships, community programs - all tracked through a single accredited record? That's 2026. Right now.

There's a growing movement that some are calling open education, and it looks nothing like the personalized learning most people in the industry are talking about.

## It Doesn't Look Like Adaptive Software

When most people in education talk about personalized learning, they mean adaptive software inside a classroom. A program that adjusts question difficulty based on how a student did on the last ten problems. That version has been around for a decade-plus, and, frankly, the results have been mixed.

But there's another version that starts not with software but with families making choices. And it looks completely different.

A parent in Utah selects a math curriculum from one provider, a writing program from another, and science through a local co-op. Her daughter does art at a community studio on Tuesdays - and goes to the neighborhood public school on Wednesdays and Fridays for band and PE, because that's where her friends are and those programs are genuinely good. An eight-year-old in Indiana spends mornings on an adaptive math platform at home and afternoons at a nature program run by a retired biologist. A teenager in Iowa builds a portfolio through mentorships, online courses, and project-based work - all rolling up into an accredited transcript.

None of these families are following a single program designed by a district curriculum committee. They're not anti-public school, either - some of them are using public school as one ingredient in a larger mix. They're assembling personalized learning from available parts, tailored to a specific kid. If that's not personalized learning in its most literal form, I'm not sure what is.

And here's what gets interesting from a cost perspective: microschools and hybrid homeschool models are pulling this off at $7,000 to $14,000 per student. Traditional district per-pupil spending runs $15,000 to $20,000+ in most states. The old logic assumed personalization required *more* resources, not fewer. Turns out, when you remove the assumption that everything has to happen in one building under one roof, the economics shift in ways most policy conversations haven't caught up with.

## What Made This Possible

This didn't happen by accident. A few things converged in the last five years, and they're worth naming.

**The mix-and-match became legitimate.** This is maybe the biggest shift. For a long time, education operated as an all-or-nothing proposition. You went to public school, or you homeschooled, or you went private. Mixing wasn't really an option. Now families are doing what I'd call open education - drawing from multiple sources at once and combining them into something that fits their kid.

What's interesting is that some public school districts are adapting to this rather than fighting it. Districts in several states have started offering a la carte learning options - single classes, electives, or resources that families can plug into broader, personalized learning pathways. As Ron Matus, Director of Research at Step Up For Students, shared in a recent conversation with Michael Horn: "There are districts that are seeing the times have changed. Some families don't want our whole package deal. They just want some of the pieces." Programs like DaVinci Connect and Homeschool Connect are turning underutilized school facilities into community learning hubs. In Arizona, the Vail School District actually created a rate card for individual course purchases - families can buy core academic classes, electives, sports participation, even club access, while maintaining their primary educational approach elsewhere.

This is a meaningful shift. Districts moving from "enroll in everything or nothing" to "here's what we offer, take what works" is what open education looks like at the system level. Programs like OpenEd, which partner with public school districts across nine states, are built on this model - families enrolled in an accredited program who can still access public school offerings, co-ops, microschools, online courses, whatever combination serves their kid best.

**Funding caught up.** Education Savings Accounts in over 17 states are part of this story, but they're not the whole story. Employer-funded education benefits are growing fast - nationally, 25% of online college enrollments at institutions like WGU and SNHU are funded by employers. Internationally, Singapore introduced reskilling allowances, France offers training credits to all workers, Sweden covers up to 80% of salary for workers changing fields. The trend line is clear: funding is moving closer to the learner, from multiple directions, not just one mechanism. The old scarcity model - one school, one budget, one path - is giving way to what I've been calling an abundance approach, where families and individuals can access learning resources from a variety of sources and fund them in a variety of ways.

**AI became connective tissue.** When you're pulling curriculum from four providers, going to public school for two classes, tracking progress across multiple learning environments, and trying to identify gaps before they become problems, you need something holding the picture together. AI recommendation engines, adaptive platforms, and progress-tracking tools are filling that role. They're rudimentary compared to the Scout I imagined for Jamie in 2040, but the function is the same: helping a learner and their family see the whole landscape and make better choices within it. As Dr. Yong Zhao has put it, the goal of AI in education is not "to help all students achieve the same outcomes" but "to help each student to become uniquely great in their own way." That's personalized learning as a philosophy, not just a product.

The people behind these systems - I've borrowed Reid Hoffman's framework and called them Bloomers - saw abundance where others saw risk. They didn't wait for one perfect solution. They built options and let families choose.

## A Day in the Life, 2026 Edition

Here's a composite drawn from real families. It's not fictional (unlike my 2040 version, though I liked that one too).

Monday morning. A ten-year-old works through a math lesson on an adaptive platform at the kitchen table. The platform adjusts based on where she got stuck last week. Her mom reviews the progress dashboard over coffee - fractions are clicking, measurement still needs work.

Late morning. They drive to a co-op meetup at a community center. Eight kids from different families work on a group engineering project, building a scale model bridge. A parent with a civil engineering background volunteers as facilitator. The kids range from age 8 to 13. Nobody is sorting by grade level.

Afternoon. She has a video call with a writing tutor who helps her shape a personal essay about her family's backyard garden into an argument about local food systems. This goes into her portfolio.

Wednesday looks different. She goes to her neighborhood public school for band rehearsal and PE. She's been playing trumpet since third grade, and the school's band director is excellent. Her parents didn't want to give that up, and in an open education model, they don't have to. She eats lunch with her school friends, stays for PE, then heads home.

Her mom, meanwhile, is working through an online bookkeeping course on the same platform that hosts some of her daughter's curriculum. She's building toward a credential she can use for freelance work.

Everything the daughter does - the adaptive math, the co-op, the tutoring, the band class at the public school - rolls up into an accredited transcript through her education program. All documented, all counting toward graduation.

I keep thinking about the parallels to Jamie's 2040 day. The AI assistant is a progress dashboard instead of a conversational agent. The "city as classroom" is a kitchen table, a community center, and an actual public school - not repurposed downtown buildings. The multigenerational learning is a mom doing bookkeeping while her daughter does math, not a grandmother taking piano on a unified city platform.

The differences are real. But the model - open, mixed, personalized, tracked - is the same.

[NOTE FOR MASON: If you have a specific family or program you've visited that fits this pattern, we'd love to swap in a real story here. OpenEd can also connect you with families who are mixing public school and alternative approaches if that's helpful.]

## What We Haven't Figured Out

I'd be dishonest if I painted this as a solved problem. A few gaps are real and worth naming, and they map to concerns I've heard from edleaders across the spectrum.

**The equity question.** The families assembling personalized learning pathways right now tend to be resourced, informed, and connected. They know how to find providers, evaluate curriculum, and manage a complex schedule. Expanded funding options help with the money piece, but they don't solve discovery or support. A single parent working two jobs doesn't have the bandwidth to research fifteen curriculum options and coordinate co-op schedules. This is where partnerships with districts and accredited programs matter - they can provide the structure, the curation, and the support that make open education accessible to families who can't do it alone. But we're not there yet at scale. This is the Bloomer challenge - moving forward with both optimism *and* caution, making sure that innovation doesn't just serve the already-served.

**Credential portability.** A portfolio of real-world projects and verified skills is arguably more meaningful than a GPA. But employers and colleges still want transcripts, and not all transcripts are treated equally. The digital learner wallet I imagined for 2040 - where credentials from any source are portable, verified, and universally recognized - is technically possible today through Learner Employment Records and digital credentialing standards. It's just not widely adopted. We're seeing organizations around the globe pilot and begin codifying these infrastructures, but it's moving slowly.

**The imagination gap.** This one might be the biggest barrier. Most people still picture "school" as a building with classrooms, a principal, and a bell schedule. When you describe what open education families are actually doing - mixing public school classes with co-ops, online courses, and mentorships into a single accredited pathway - the response is often some version of "But is that real school?" Until the mental model of what education can look like shifts at a broader scale, these approaches stay on the margins. As we wrote in our *Blogs from the Future* series: "We are living in someone's imagined future. To build differently, we first have to imagine a better one."

## Building, Not Waiting

In the spirit of that imagination work, I want to return to where I started. I spent a few months writing about what education *could* look like if we let go of old constraints - fixed buildings, fixed schedules, fixed funding, fixed boundaries between "public school kid" and "homeschool kid." I built an imaginary world set in 2040 to make the case that something better was possible.

What I've learned since is that the families actually doing this didn't need the thought experiment. They needed options, a way to fund them, and a system willing to count everything their kids were learning - whether it happened at a kitchen table, a community center, or the neighborhood school. In a growing number of states, they have all three.

What if personalized learning isn't a product that a school installs? What if it's what happens when families get real choices and a system that values all forms of learning, regardless of where they happen? What if the infrastructure we've been waiting for already exists - assembled from the bottom up by families, supported by districts and programs willing to do things differently?

The future of open education is a ten-year-old doing adaptive math at home, building a bridge at a co-op, playing trumpet at her public school, and writing about her garden with a tutor - all in the same week, all counting. And her mom, studying alongside her, because the system finally lets her.

Some families are already there. The rest of us are catching up.
