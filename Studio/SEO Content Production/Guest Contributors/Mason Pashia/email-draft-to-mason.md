Subject: took a liberty with your writing - tell me if this lands

Hey Mason,

Hope the new year's treating you well. I've been going back through your Getting Smart pieces - the abundance/scarcity series, the lifelong learning article, the 2040 blogs - and I kept noticing how much of what you're describing maps onto what we're actually seeing families do through OpenEd.

So I took the liberty of pulling together a draft that kind of synthesizes your arguments into the open education narrative we're building on our end. It draws pretty heavily from your published work - the Bloomer framework, the Matus and Yong Zhao quotes, the international funding models, the Jamie/Scout speculative piece - and tries to connect it to what's actually happening on the ground with families who are mixing and matching public school, co-ops, online curriculum, and mentorships into a single accredited pathway.

Here's the doc: [LINK]

I want to be upfront - this is very much a rough draft, and it's your call whether it's worth working with or whether you'd rather come up with something totally different. A few honest notes:

- The "day in the life" section is a composite I made up. If you have a real family or program visit that fits, swapping that in would make it way stronger.
- I leaned into the open education / district partnership angle since that's where our work intersects with yours. If that framing feels off or too OpenEd-centric, happy to pull it back.
- The voice is my best attempt at matching yours. Some of it will feel like you, some of it probably won't. That's what editing is for.

The idea would be to publish this on our blog under your byline, with links back to your Getting Smart pieces. We'd promote it to our audience (60K+ families across 9 states) and handle all the social distribution. You'd get exposure to a readership that's literally living the stuff you write about.

But honestly, if you read it and think "this isn't quite right, I'd rather take a different angle" - that's totally fine too. I'd rather get something you're genuinely proud of than force a fit.

Let me know what you think when you get a chance.

Charlie
