# Mason Pashia - Guest Contributor Package

## Relationship Context

Mason is a writer at Getting Smart (Tom Vander Ark's org). Active conversation as of Dec 2025 about "what OpenEd families are searching for in the marketplace." He's already interested in our data. This guest piece gives him a byline, a plug for Getting Smart, and a reason to keep talking.

## Source Material (4 Getting Smart Articles)

### 1. Choosing Abundance Despite an Instinct for Scarcity (Mar 2025)
**URL:** https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/03/18/choosing-abundance-despite-an-instinct-for-scarcity-new-experiences-and-new-models/

**Core argument:** Humans default to scarcity thinking, but education needs an abundance mindset. Introduces the "Bloomer" framework (vs. Doomers, Gloomers, Zoomers). Highlights microschools at $7-14k/student, ESA expansion in 17 states, unbundled learning, AI personalization, and digital credentials (LERs).

**Key quotes/ideas to preserve:**
- The Bloomer taxonomy - this is distinctly Mason's
- Microschool cost data ($7-14k vs traditional per-pupil spending)
- ESA expansion as abundance infrastructure
- "Removing regulatory barriers" framing

---

### 2. Lifelong Learning as Abundant Learning (Apr 2025)
**URL:** https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/04/24/lifelong-learning-as-abundant-learning-why-the-answer-to-funding-our-education-systems-might-be-to-rethink-who-they-serveby-mason-pashia/

**Core argument:** K-12 students are only 16% of the population. Schools should serve everyone - adults reskilling, seniors learning, parents upskilling. High schools exist in every community but sit empty most of the day. International models (Singapore, France, Sweden, South Korea) show how.

**Key quotes/ideas to preserve:**
- The 16% stat and the "60% between college and retirement" framing
- Personal anecdote about losing university access post-graduation
- "Districts offering a la carte learning options"
- Real examples: Homeschool Connect, DaVinci Connect, Launch Pad
- International funding models (Singapore reskilling allowances, etc.)

---

### 3. Blogs from the Future: 2040 (Nov 2025)
**URL:** https://www.gettingsmart.com/blogs-from-the-future-2040/

**Core argument:** Landing page for speculative fiction series. "We are living in someone's imagined future. To build differently, we first have to imagine a better one." Links to Third Horizon whitepaper.

**Key ideas to preserve:**
- The speculative fiction methodology itself
- "Fictional but informed" as a content format
- The framing that imagination is infrastructure for change

---

### 4. What Did I Do "At School" Today? A Learner from 2040 Tells All (Jul 2025)
**URL:** https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/07/17/what-did-i-do-at-school-today-a-learner-from-2040-tells-all/

**Core argument:** Speculative fiction following Jamie, a 2040 high schooler in an unbundled learning ecosystem. AI assistant "Scout" guides her learning. City infrastructure supports education - autonomous transit, repurposed buildings as learning hubs. Her mom upskills in AI ethics, grandma takes piano - all on digital learning records.

**Key quotes/ideas to preserve:**
- Jamie's daily routine (the specific narrative voice)
- "The city becomes the classroom"
- Scout (AI learning assistant) concept
- Digital learner wallet / verified credentials from real-world projects
- Multigenerational learning on one system
- Real-world signals cited: Tacoma distributed campus, CAPS Network, Knowledge Society

## The OpenEd Angle

### Why This Fits

Mason writes about the **future** of education as theory. OpenEd **is already doing** chunks of what he describes:

| Mason's Vision | OpenEd's Reality |
|----------------|------------------|
| Unbundled, a la carte learning | Families choose curriculum piece by piece |
| ESA-funded choice | OpenEd operates in 9 ESA/choice states |
| Microschool-adjacent models | OpenEd families form co-ops, learning pods |
| "The city as classroom" | OpenEd families use libraries, museums, community resources as school |
| Digital learning records | OpenEd provides accredited transcripts for non-traditional paths |
| AI-personalized pathways | OpenEd's marketplace lets families tailor by learning style |
| Lifelong/multigenerational | OpenEd parents learn alongside kids (many report this) |

### The Strategic Value

1. **For SEO:** Targets "personalized learning" (1,600/mo, 0.06 competition) - a keyword where OpenEd doesn't rank but should own. The SERP is all institutional/academic content with no practitioner voice. Secondary coverage of microschool (4,400/mo) and alternative education (1,000/mo) builds topical authority across the cluster.
2. **For Mason:** Gets a byline on OpenEd (new audience), links back to his Getting Smart pieces, positions him as the thinker whose ideas are being realized
3. **For the relationship:** Deepens the warm lead. He sees OpenEd as a platform that validates his work, not just a company trying to get free content
4. **For credibility:** Getting Smart writer publishing on OpenEd = borrowed authority from a major ed publication
5. **For commercial value:** The "personalized learning ai" keyword has a $41.76 CPC - the highest in the entire dataset. This signals serious advertiser spend in the space, meaning the traffic is valuable.

## SEO Keyword Targets (Validated via DataForSEO - Feb 2026)

### Primary Target

| Keyword | Volume/mo | CPC | Competition | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----|-------------|-------|
| **personalized learning** | **1,600** | $8.38 | **0.06** | Almost zero competition. SERP is institutional/academic - no practitioner voice |
| personalized learning in education | 720 | $24.78 | 0.01 | High CPC, near-zero competition |
| personalized learning ai | 480 | $41.76 | 0.02 | Highest CPC in entire dataset - maps to Mason's AI Scout concept |
| personalized learning examples | 70 | $2.38 | 0.05 | Natural fit for "what families are actually doing" angle |

### Secondary Keywords (weave naturally)

| Keyword | Volume/mo | CPC | Competition | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----|-------------|-------|
| microschool | 4,400 | $6.44 | 0.41 | Mention in context, don't optimize for |
| alternative education | 1,000 | $5.57 | 0.10 | Category framing |
| microschool curriculum | 260 | $4.26 | 0.12 | Natural mention in "what families choose" section |
| education savings account | 12,100 | $3.48 | 0.26 | Contextual mention only - SERP intent is financial (529s) not school choice |

### Dead Ends (validated - do not target)

| Keyword | Why Not |
|---------|---------|
| unbundled learning | No search data at all - Mason's vocabulary, not the market's |
| future of homeschooling | 10/mo - no volume |
| school choice | SERP dominated by district enrollment portals |
| abundance mindset education | No data - too niche |

### SEO Strategy Note

The SERP for "personalized learning" is all institutional content (Understood.org, Ed Elements, Wikipedia, EdWeek). Nobody is writing from the **practitioner/family perspective**. A piece from a Getting Smart writer using real family examples would be genuinely differentiated. The piece should feel like thought leadership, not an SEO article - keywords woven naturally. The $41.76 CPC on "personalized learning ai" signals serious commercial value in this space.

## Draft Outline: "What Personalized Learning Actually Looks Like"

**Working title options:**
- What Personalized Learning Actually Looks Like (From Families Already Doing It)
- Personalized Learning Was Supposed to Be the Future. These Families Aren't Waiting.
- I Wrote About Education in 2040. Then I Found Families Living It in 2026.
- The Personalized Learning Revolution Nobody Wrote About

**Primary keyword:** personalized learning (1,600/mo)
**Secondary keywords:** personalized learning ai, personalized learning in education, personalized learning examples, microschool, alternative education
**Target:** ~1,800 words | Mason Pashia byline | Published on OpenEd blog
**Recommended word count from SERP analysis:** 1,500-2,227 (avg competitor: 2,958 but those are institutional guides - a tighter opinion/evidence piece will outperform)

### Structure

**1. Opening: I Imagined 2040. Families Beat Me to It. (~200 words)**

Start with a compressed version of Jamie's day from the 2040 piece - the AI assistant, the city as classroom, the multigenerational learning. Two or three sentences max. Then the pivot: "I spent months building that fictional world. Then I started talking to families who are already doing versions of this - not in 2040, but now, with tools and funding that didn't exist five years ago."

*H2: "Personalized Learning Was Supposed to Be the Future"*

*Voice note: Mason opens with systems-level observations, then pivots to the personal. This opening mirrors his 2040 piece but flips the direction - from fiction to reality instead of reality to fiction.*

**2. What "Personalized" Means When Families Define It (~300 words)**

The institutional definition of personalized learning (adaptive software, differentiated instruction within a classroom) vs. what families actually build when given the freedom and funding:

- A parent selects math curriculum from one provider, writing from another, science from a co-op, art from a community studio
- An AI tool helps track progress and suggest next steps (connect to Scout concept)
- The learning record isn't a report card - it's a portfolio of real work, mentorships, and verified skills
- This isn't a school program. It's a family assembling a personalized learning ecosystem from available parts.

*H2: "When Families Build It Themselves"*

Key stat to include: microschools operating at $7-14k/student vs. $15-20k+ district per-pupil (from his March piece). The cost of personalization is dropping.

**3. The Infrastructure That Made This Possible (~300 words)**

Three things changed in the last five years that turned personalized learning from theory to practice:

1. **Funding:** ESAs now in 17+ states. Families get direct spending power. Reference OpenEd's 9 operating states as evidence of the funding reaching families.
2. **Curriculum unbundling:** Districts offering a la carte options (his DaVinci Connect, Homeschool Connect examples). Plus the explosion of independent providers families can mix and match.
3. **AI as the connective tissue:** Not replacing teachers - helping families navigate choices, track progress, find gaps. Mason's Scout concept from 2040 is proto-real in the form of recommendation engines and adaptive platforms.

*H2: "Three Shifts That Changed Everything"*

Reference his Bloomer framework here - the people who saw abundance instead of scarcity are the ones who built these systems.

**4. A Day in the Life, 2026 Edition (~250 words)**

Mirror the structure of his Jamie/2040 piece, but real. Describe a composite day of an OpenEd-style family:

- Morning: Kid works through math on an adaptive platform at home
- Late morning: Co-op meetup at a community center - group science project
- Afternoon: Mentorship session with a local professional (architecture, coding, whatever fits the kid's interest)
- Everything rolls up into an accredited transcript through OpenEd
- Mom, meanwhile, is using an online course for her own professional development

*H2: "What a Personalized Learning Day Actually Looks Like"*

Compare briefly to Jamie's 2040 day. The parallels should land without being forced. The differences are real too - no autonomous transit, no bioluminescent streetlights. But the learning model? Closer than anyone expected.

*[ANECDOTE PLACEHOLDER] - ask Mason if he has a real family story, or pull from OpenEd testimonials with permission.*

**5. What's Still Missing (~200 words)**

Mason is credible because he doesn't oversell. This section is critical for authenticity.

- **Equity gap:** Not every family can navigate this. The families assembling personalized learning tend to be resourced, informed, and connected. ESA expansion helps but doesn't solve discovery and support.
- **Credential portability:** A portfolio of real work is more meaningful than a transcript, but employers and colleges still want transcripts. The digital learner wallet Mason imagined for 2040 is still early.
- **The imagination gap:** Most people still picture "school" as a building with classrooms. Until that mental model shifts, personalized learning stays niche.

*H2: "What We Haven't Figured Out Yet"*

**6. Close: Personalized Learning Is a Bet on Families (~200 words)**

The abundance argument, distilled. Personalized learning works when you trust families to make good choices and give them the tools and funding to do so. The scarcity model assumes they can't or won't. The families proving otherwise aren't waiting for 2040.

Circle back to the "Blogs from the Future" premise: imagining better systems gives us permission to build them. Some families already have.

*H2: "A Bet on Families"*

No hard CTA. The OpenEd context does the conversion work on its own. Mason's signature move is ending with a forward-looking statement that's optimistic but not naive.

## Voice Notes for Drafting

**Mason's writing style (from studying 4 articles):**
- Systems thinker. Zooms between macro (policy, demographics) and micro (personal stories, daily routines)
- Uses data but not data-heavy. One or two stats per section, always contextualized
- Frameworks guy - creates taxonomies (Bloomer/Doomer/Gloomer/Zoomer) and comparison tables
- Speculative but grounded - always ties the vision back to real signals
- Not preachy. Acknowledges complexity and tradeoffs
- Doesn't use "I" much except for personal anecdotes
- Section headers are descriptive, not clever
- Comfortable with longer paragraphs (not the short-punchy AI style)
- Cites specific programs and organizations by name
- International perspective - references global models naturally

**What to avoid (per OpenEd writing rules):**
- No "X isn't just Y - it's Z" constructions
- No em dashes (use hyphens with spaces)
- No AI-ism words (delve, comprehensive, leverage, navigate, etc.)
- No "In today's fast-paced..." or similar throat-clearing

**What to preserve (Mason-isms):**
- His Bloomer/Doomer/Gloomer/Zoomer framework
- The scarcity-to-abundance framing (his signature)
- Specific program names (DaVinci Connect, CAPS, Tacoma model)
- The speculative fiction callback
- International comparisons (Singapore, France, Sweden)
