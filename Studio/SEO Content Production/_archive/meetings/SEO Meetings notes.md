[00:00] Chavilah Stowers: Chavilah Stowers joined
[00:06] Charlie Deist: Hey, everybody.
[00:08] Melissa Wurzel: Hey. How's it going?
[00:09] Frederic Lee: Hey, Happy New Year.
[00:10] Melissa Wurzel: Happy New Year to you. How are the holidays?
[00:13] Charlie Deist: Good.
[00:15] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, Good fun, good family time.
[00:20] Charlie Deist: You know, the usual.
[00:21] Frederic Lee: How about you all?
[00:23] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, it was nice. It was nice to take a little break.
[00:28] Charlie Deist: Yeah, it was good. We had one. It was pretty uneventful, with one exception, which is early.
[00:34] Charlie Deist: Early on, a few days before Christmas, we have this.
[00:37] Charlie Deist: I don't know if I told you guys, Melissa and all you. About the. The boar that we're borrowing.
[00:44] Charlie Deist: Did I tell you about this?
[00:45] Melissa Wurzel: I don't think so.
[00:47] Charlie Deist: The thing with boars is you really only need them for a couple weeks in order to get your females pregnant, and then you don't want them around because they're nasty and they eat a lot of food.
[00:58] Charlie Deist: So we're borrowing this bore from a friend and hoping to just pass him off to the next sucker as soon as possible.
[01:04] Charlie Deist: But I left. I left the gate open and he got out.
[01:08] Charlie Deist: And so I enlisted my wife to come out and help me, and she got. She got kind of.
[01:15] Charlie Deist: We're trying to corral him in, and she's like using this kiddie pool as a shield to sort of get him to go.
[01:20] Charlie Deist: But.
[01:21] Charlie Deist: But he got past her defenses and sort of like bucked at her a little bit, and she didn't even notice, really.
[01:26] Charlie Deist: Like, she thought that she got scratched.
[01:28] Charlie Deist: But later on we realized that it had really, like, one of her tusks had really kind of gored her leg.
[01:35] Charlie Deist: And so we had to go to the. The urgent care, and she got like eight stitches.
[01:41] Frederic Lee: But we'll just.
[01:44] Charlie Deist: Life on the farm.
[01:46] Melissa Wurzel: Dang, Charlie, that's exciting.
[01:49] Frederic Lee: That was right before Christmas?
[01:53] Charlie Deist: Yeah, a few days before Christmas. But she took it in strike.
[02:01] Frederic Lee: Yeah, she was getting around okay. Walking all right with it.
[02:05] Charlie Deist: Yeah, yeah, it was. It was only a flesh wound, as the Monty Python skit would say.
[02:13] Melissa Wurzel: Did you get rid of the boar?
[02:16] Charlie Deist: No, we still have the boar, but we locked him in there pretty good. He's a.
[02:19] Charlie Deist: You know, barred the doors and all that. Pallets and rebar. He's in board jail.
[02:28] Frederic Lee: He didn't have boar meat for. For Christmas dinner.
[02:31] Charlie Deist: I hear the poor meat's not as tasty. It's like a little gamier.
[02:35] Charlie Deist: So this guy, he gets spared because he has a job to do. The other pigs, we. We slaughtered.
[02:40] Charlie Deist: So we already have a freezer full of pork right now.
[02:43] Frederic Lee: Okay.
[02:46] Charlie Deist: Nice.
[02:48] Frederic Lee: I have a. I have a good SEO buddy I worked with for a while at my last agency, and he.
[02:54] Frederic Lee: He was living in California and he moved out to Missouri and bought a farm with his wife.
[03:01] Frederic Lee: And now he does SEO and farming on the side too. Sounds like a nice life.
[03:07] Melissa Wurzel: Wow.
[03:08] Charlie Deist: That's the dream, right? SEO and farming. Yeah.
[03:14] Frederic Lee: Every kid's dream.
[03:16] Charlie Deist: Exactly.
[03:21] Frederic Lee: I do have a couple things for today, but do you want to start with anything, Melissa?
[03:29] Melissa Wurzel: No, not really, I haven't.
[03:31] Melissa Wurzel: We're still playing catch up from getting back to the holidays and looking at all the data and stuff and you might have this, Fred.
[03:39] Melissa Wurzel: But at some point I want to talk about now that we're through that marketplace Sprint with those pages, like what are the changes we should make on our side to the tools pages, if any, and, and things of that nature.
[03:51] Melissa Wurzel: But that's really it.
[03:54] Frederic Lee: Okay, great. Let me share a window.
[04:05] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee started sharing their screen
[04:11] Frederic Lee: So yeah, I was trying to kind of wrap my head around like all the different areas we're working on and my recommendations, you know, from an SEO perspective as we're, as we're continuing to expand the site.
[04:26] Frederic Lee: One area that I know we've kind of gone back and back and forth on and we've made some progress is the state based focus.
[04:37] Frederic Lee: Looking at, you know, some of our top SEO traffic pages.
[04:41] Frederic Lee: It are the, it is those state pages and I know we've discussed building kind of how to homeschool in state and other pages like that.
[04:56] Frederic Lee: That area I feel is, is a great area to continue to expand and it, it has driven and I think will continue to drive very like bottom of funnel traffic.
[05:09] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[05:12] Frederic Lee: You do get folks that are searching for things around like you know, kind of generic homeschooling phrases and if they are in a state they will sometimes receive our state based page.
[05:26] Frederic Lee: So it's helping, you know, with non branded or non.
[05:30] Frederic Lee: Yeah, non branded keywords obviously does a very good job of, you know, open plus state.
[05:38] Frederic Lee: It's a great landing page there. And so. Or go ahead.
[05:45] Frederic Lee: And so the first thing that comes to mind for me is how do we, how can we optimize these pages a bit further?
[06:00] Frederic Lee: And I was curious and you all probably know more than me, like how much on this page would you say is kind of duplicate content across all the state pages versus unique to this individual state page?
[06:14] Frederic Lee: I know we have these FAQs down here.
[06:16] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I think almost all of it is duplicate.
[06:20] Charlie Deist: There are a few program details that vary state by state, but otherwise.
[06:26] Charlie Deist: Melissa, does that match your understanding?
[06:29] Melissa Wurzel: Well, Ella just went through and Havel, you might even have a little bit of information on this.
[06:33] Melissa Wurzel: I know that she was going through these pages trying to make them more personal by state.
[06:39] Melissa Wurzel: Now that we're through like a first year in many of these states.
[06:42] Melissa Wurzel: So like the info session information is by state.
[06:46] Melissa Wurzel: Like there is a specific info sessions for each state. The FAQs are by state.
[06:52] Melissa Wurzel: The testimonials are an area that we want to get to by state. This is going to be really important.
[06:59] Melissa Wurzel: And actually, Fred, now that I'm talking about this, like, Ella pulled a report right before we went on break and it was just using the data of people telling us how they heard about us and was very interesting.
[07:12] Melissa Wurzel: And she segmented it by state and it actually showed us at a very, very, very high level that these local communities, these local grassroots efforts, these ambassadors, these local testimonials, anything we can do at that local level to basically seed that group of folks is very, very important.
[07:37] Melissa Wurzel: And it makes sense. Like there was no surprise in the report that she found.
[07:41] Melissa Wurzel: It was like, yeah, people might find out about us through a search or through an ad, but they don't sign up till they get some trust in us.
[07:49] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, no big surprise. Yeah, this will. I like that this is an area of focus.
[07:54] Melissa Wurzel: I think this should be an area of focus we want. Ella will come back.
[07:58] Melissa Wurzel: I think she had just pulled that, that plan. And so we'll probably make some more optimizations by.
[08:04] Melissa Wurzel: By state page as well for that plan.
[08:07] Melissa Wurzel: The other thing I will mention, so I don't forget is right before we went out, Kendall, who leads our essentially like parent services support team, said she was talking to one of our ambassadors in Indiana and she made the comment.
[08:26] Melissa Wurzel: It's just so hard to Google open ed in Indiana because of what comes up.
[08:32] Melissa Wurzel: She said they are used to googling braintree. Braintree is a different term than opened, essentially.
[08:40] Melissa Wurzel: So she just made that comment.
[08:42] Melissa Wurzel: And I asked Kendall to get more specific information for us because we can't see that stuff at a local level in Indiana of what comes up.
[08:50] Melissa Wurzel: So she was going to get me more info, but I just wanted to mention Indiana because to me our top 3, 3 priority growth rate states, amongst all the other launches that we'll do this next year are going to be Oregon, Nevada and Indiana.
[09:06] Melissa Wurzel: So anything we can do for those three most especially will be important.
[09:11] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, the rest of them will be important too. But I just wanted to mention all that.
[09:17] Frederic Lee: Okay, that's helpful. We do pull quite a good amount of traffic to the Oregon page.
[09:27] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I think that's the top one, right? Like out of the state pages.
[09:31] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, it is. One sec. There she Is.
[09:41] Frederic Lee: Yeah, it's the third highest traffic page on the entire website.
[09:45] Melissa Wurzel: Interesting.
[09:46] Frederic Lee: That is great. Indiana's up there.
[09:50] Melissa Wurzel: That's good to know.
[09:53] Frederic Lee: In terms of SEO traffic, you know.
[09:55] Melissa Wurzel: Right.
[09:57] Frederic Lee: And then you said Nevada.
[09:59] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[10:00] Melissa Wurzel: And that one's pretty new because we just launched that state for mid year and there was a lot of weird stuff with mid year because we're still waiting for final state approval and stuff like that.
[10:10] Melissa Wurzel: So it was sort of like, we think we'll be ready, but we may not.
[10:13] Melissa Wurzel: So we didn't sign up as many people as we thought we would.
[10:16] Charlie Deist: But.
[10:16] Melissa Wurzel: But the interest is there.
[10:19] Melissa Wurzel: Like I think for this next full year, like Nevada will go gangbusters if we plant the right seeds.
[10:26] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[10:28] Frederic Lee: Okay, great. So yeah, that's definitely phase one is the on page updates. Really.
[10:40] Frederic Lee: It's about like, how can we make those pages and all you said about the ambassadors and things like, like that fit this, but how do we make them more unique to the state and demonstrating our expertise and our experience and the brand ambassadors type of quotes and testimonials will very much hit on that.
[10:59] Frederic Lee: Okay, the next area is supplemental content to those. It's the how to homeschool.
[11:07] Frederic Lee: I also saw some for the Oregon page.
[11:10] Frederic Lee: Some people are searching around like homeschool stipend and Oregon homeschool curriculum.
[11:16] Frederic Lee: So there's kind of bucket of three or so additional questions folks have outside of just like homeschooling programs.
[11:26] Charlie Deist: Oregon, cool.
[11:30] Frederic Lee: So I know that this is. These are this type of content we've been discussing.
[11:36] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I think we should get this on the priorities kind of asap, you know, just because it'll need some time up there, you know, before the enrollment periods.
[11:48] Frederic Lee: So then the last area is link building to the state pages.
[11:56] Frederic Lee: That'll continue to boost our authority there.
[12:02] Frederic Lee: And I know it kind of goes into again the like some of the word of mouth, some of the podcasting, some things like that.
[12:16] Frederic Lee: That's one area of like how do we continue to encourage links and mentions to areas of the site?
[12:24] Frederic Lee: If it's a state specific podcast or anything, you know, relationship that we have, linking to the state page would be valuable.
[12:34] Frederic Lee: And then the next phase of that is do we do like, you know, a full link building campaign for these, which I know we, we talked about maybe as a phase two as the site matures.
[12:46] Melissa Wurzel: Yep, that sounds good.
[12:49] Frederic Lee: So yeah, state definitely bullish towards it. I think it's a great area to continue to work on.
[12:57] Melissa Wurzel: Charlie, do we have any, do you know if we have any of those ambassadors by state that have been on the podcast or featured in the newsletter, whatever.
[13:04] Melissa Wurzel: I, I'm sure they're just like either linking back to the main site and not probably the state specific page if they do any linking to us.
[13:17] Charlie Deist: You mean people that we've had on our podcast or people that have put up their own content on their own sites either.
[13:27] Charlie Deist: That's a good question. Delina Wallace, Brittany Shannon, Chrissy Shaughnessy, they all have.
[13:36] Charlie Deist: Actually, I don't know what Chrissy Shaughnessy's online presence is, but Delina, we should look into that and then when it comes to their podcast episode, actually, Chris.
[13:49] Charlie Deist: See, we're about her podcast next week. Brittany.
[13:53] Charlie Deist: And we've done two podcasts with Delina and I think for the most part we link to just the general open ed page.
[14:04] Charlie Deist: But if we're, you know, if we are having Delina share with people in her networks.
[14:09] Charlie Deist: Yeah, it would make sense to put a prominent link to the Kansas page in there.
[14:13] Charlie Deist: No one else comes to mind being in our, like, I don't, I don't know.
[14:16] Charlie Deist: Do we even have ambassadors in Indiana or Nevada, Chrissy?
[14:21] Melissa Wurzel: I think we have one or two in Indiana, Nevada, some new.
[14:25] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know if we have that yet, but I think this is something I can ask Ella when she gets back.
[14:32] Melissa Wurzel: Like, we're going to need to put together some sort of little plan, especially for these top three states.
[14:37] Melissa Wurzel: I mean for all of them really.
[14:38] Melissa Wurzel: But you know, I think there'll be a lot of conversation at the off site SLT next week about the whole communities, you know, events and local communities, you know, ambassadors, that whole thing.
[14:54] Melissa Wurzel: So as we grow that function, which I, I think it will grow this year just with all these new states, we need to be connecting the dots with these local ambassadors and making sure that we're driving stuff to these state specific pages when it makes sense.
[15:11] Charlie Deist: Yeah. Okay. Okay, great.
[15:19] Frederic Lee: And then on the tools side.
[15:24] Charlie Deist: This.
[15:24] Frederic Lee: Is something we emailed briefly about.
[15:30] Frederic Lee: So the Tools pages are, you see, generating a bit of buzz, especially since we updated the title tags on them.
[15:40] Frederic Lee: One thing that hit is we began ranking for Prodigy Math style keywords again, which really boosted our impressions.
[15:51] Frederic Lee: How big that brand is.
[15:53] Charlie Deist: Interesting.
[15:56] Frederic Lee: We did kind of fall off.
[15:58] Frederic Lee: It's just Google very much testing to see whether our Prodigy Math page would fit within their page one results for people searching about Prodigy Math.
[16:09] Frederic Lee: And the one reason that we, I believe can kind of get back into that first page is those tool page updates we mentioned of like, how do we combine our, what parents say on this page itself, because it's quite a thin page right now.
[16:29] Frederic Lee: And we're positioning these pages as really a review of the tool pros and cons.
[16:37] Frederic Lee: And so that's an area that, that if we really kind of want to rank among these tool names and provide good reviews, this would be a priority for me.
[16:53] Melissa Wurzel: Is there any other tools besides Prodigy Math, Fred, that like kind of showed that spike that we should concentrate on just quickly looking at that.
[17:03] Melissa Wurzel: I'm like, okay, Prodigy Math is on the Open Ed Marketplace.
[17:06] Melissa Wurzel: So we, you know, Charlie, this gets back to this whole conversation about we need to look at the Marketplace page and see if it's ready to get.
[17:18] Melissa Wurzel: For us to even just redirect that particular tool page to it.
[17:22] Melissa Wurzel: So we're not constantly keeping up with it. But I don't know if it's ready for that or not yet.
[17:30] Charlie Deist: I guess. Let me, let me think about that a little bit.
[17:35] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[17:37] Melissa Wurzel: I know that they built areas of the new Marketplace page where we could put things in like testimonials.
[17:44] Melissa Wurzel: I think, I think the, the functionality is there.
[17:50] Melissa Wurzel: It's just that it needs to be filled in and updated and all that stuff. And I also like, it will not.
[17:59] Melissa Wurzel: It will have the random like URL with all the numbers and the letters and it's not going to have Prodigy Map in the URL.
[18:06] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[18:11] Frederic Lee: The other thing to consider there is, you know, we've seen our tools page get traffic over time.
[18:18] Frederic Lee: The Marketplace.
[18:22] Melissa Wurzel: It probably hasn't gotten much because they just pushed that thing out.
[18:26] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Google hasn't really recognized much of.
[18:31] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I mean, I was kind of thinking, I don't know if I want to open this can of worms.
[18:39] Charlie Deist: But I guess I was just thinking, to the extent that we're keeping the marketing page up, what is the harm in it?
[18:51] Charlie Deist: Because I kind of see them fulfilling a different function than the Marketplace.
[18:57] Charlie Deist: If it's more of the general reviews, like somebody that lands in the marketplace who's not in the program is going to be immediately sort of driven away.
[19:07] Charlie Deist: But if somebody has questions about one of our vendors and they land on the marketing page that has a, you know, well written SEO optimized parent review with either an external link or actually for the vendors instead of an external link, we could then push them to the marketplace where they would see, oh, I can get this, you know, at no cost, would it be worth maybe reconsidering?
[19:34] Charlie Deist: What, like, if we get a really good system in place for creating these pages where it's, it's, you know, Almost trivial.
[19:40] Charlie Deist: To just pump out more, More pages with a little bit of personal perspective from a parent that's used it.
[19:49] Melissa Wurzel: I think your challenge there is every time Jen updates, and I don't know how often that is, she specifically had mentioned pricing, but like keeping that information in alignment with what her team is managing is what to me makes this difficult.
[20:05] Melissa Wurzel: Now. I don't know how many times she updates it.
[20:07] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know if Prodigy Mask gets updated all that often. The pricing thing.
[20:12] Charlie Deist: Yeah. I mean, what if, what if we just kill it? Right, right, right. Maybe. Maybe.
[20:18] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, the link to the marketplace under the pricing. I mean, I don't know.
[20:22] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[20:23] Melissa Wurzel: Sense or whatever. But like, that's how I would think about it. Charlie.
[20:26] Melissa Wurzel: Like if you talk to her, like, I think her biggest concerns are alignment with pricing.
[20:34] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[20:35] Melissa Wurzel: So, yeah, I mean, I.
[20:38] Melissa Wurzel: This has been something I've been thinking about for a while because I'm like, I still think these pages on the market site are easier to digest for someone who has no idea what they're looking at versus landing on our marketplace.
[20:52] Melissa Wurzel: It's just keeping them in alignment with the information because her team is constantly getting all that stuff and we're not, you know.
[21:00] Charlie Deist: Right. Yeah.
[21:04] Frederic Lee: I mean, I agree that these pages serve different purposes.
[21:08] Frederic Lee: The tools in the marketplace and the way that we position these as like a review of a larger tool.
[21:17] Melissa Wurzel: You.
[21:17] Frederic Lee: Know, very kind of informational based way to attract more, more users and use this as a funnel, as Charlie said, to get people through to the marketplace, if applicable.
[21:29] Melissa Wurzel: Mm.
[21:30] Frederic Lee: And is it that Prodigy, for example, changes their monthly cost and then your marketplace team gets that info and that's not getting back to.
[21:40] Frederic Lee: Okay, we have. I mean, how many tools do we feature right now?
[21:53] Melissa Wurzel: And not all of them are on the marketplace. That's the thing.
[21:56] Melissa Wurzel: Like, Charlie, I don't know if you know how many of these tools on here are actually on the marketplace versus not like 50.
[22:03] Melissa Wurzel: 50 or. I mean.
[22:07] Charlie Deist: Let'S see. I. I think we scrubbed some. Oh, no, not, not actually. Yeah, probably. Probably about 50, 50.
[22:16] Charlie Deist: Maybe. Maybe 30%.
[22:18] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[22:21] Charlie Deist: So, yeah, I'm gonna bump up in. In priority getting these ones reformatted in the, in the new.
[22:28] Charlie Deist: With the new template, we're going to get rid of that toggle and I need to remember, where do we have.
[22:34] Charlie Deist: Fred, you came up with a new template or.
[22:36] Charlie Deist: I think we had gone back and forth a little bit about the new template.
[22:41] Charlie Deist: I just need to remember where that live. Basic curriculum, maybe.
[22:46] Charlie Deist: I just saw it a little bit to the left in that there it is. Basic curriculum template. Okay.
[22:54] Charlie Deist: Crunch labs. What is it? Screenshot. Why we like it Considerations, what the experts say.
[22:59] Charlie Deist: So there's no pricing information there. That sort of solves that problem a little bit. And.
[23:04] Charlie Deist: But maybe we could still have some kind of a toggle or a badge that says like this, you know, listed, you know, this is an open ed vendor specifically.
[23:17] Frederic Lee: And then linking to the market. Charlie, that's. This is a different one.
[23:20] Charlie Deist: Oh, it is. Okay.
[23:21] Frederic Lee: So sorry, here, I got the other link here. This is the one that you, you mainly built.
[23:32] Charlie Deist: Okay, let's see.
[23:35] Frederic Lee: Right, hold on.
[23:36] Charlie Deist: Tool name. So there we do have pricing, but.
[23:40] Charlie Deist: But for any that are a vendor, maybe we could just say like check the, check the marketplace for the latest pricing information.
[23:48] Frederic Lee: Yeah, you could also have a caveat in there that like, you know, this pricing was pulled on X date, maybe subject to change.
[23:57] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[23:59] Charlie Deist: I wanted to get your perspective, Fred, on like, for these ones, I think we had agreed that it would be good to have them authored by a specific like parent or employee, you know, somebody who we could have as like the author of the page and create an author card for them.
[24:18] Charlie Deist: And so I actually wanted to start with like all the things where we already have kind of like podcast source material.
[24:24] Charlie Deist: But what if, and I think to keep it simple, that probably makes sense to just have one author.
[24:29] Charlie Deist: And then if in the future we want to add more voices or perspectives, we can kind of figure out how to integrate that but not like, not make it at this stage we're not going to try to do like full on, you know, testimonials for each one with a special formatted element for it to add in.
[24:52] Charlie Deist: I don't know what my question is actually, I'm just thinking out loud, but I was imagining what if, what if we had, you know, in our, in our system for gathering the testimonials for a curriculum, it's like, oh, well, now we've got source material from a whole bunch of different sources.
[25:10] Charlie Deist: How should we incorporate the, you know, the quotes or the details from.
[25:15] Charlie Deist: Let's say we have, you know, four parents who love it and then one who said it didn't work out for their kid.
[25:21] Charlie Deist: Oh yeah. What parents say? There we go.
[25:30] Frederic Lee: You could definitely, definitely would recommend a default kind of author for these reviews.
[25:38] Frederic Lee: Whoever's willing to put their name on it. And then.
[25:43] Frederic Lee: Yeah, when you do get individual testimonials, add those as components of the page.
[25:48] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[25:55] Melissa Wurzel: Is this template been built, Charlie, or is this just like the thoughts?
[26:00] Melissa Wurzel: No, we need to Build it in webflow.
[26:03] Charlie Deist: Well, building a webflow could be as simple as making a. I mean, I guess this is a page, right?
[26:11] Charlie Deist: So it's going to be tools slash. I think we can probably use some of this template.
[26:20] Charlie Deist: I mean most of it's just basic HTML kind of collapse the toggle.
[26:28] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[26:28] Charlie Deist: Fred, do you think we should keep those little.
[26:32] Charlie Deist: There's, there's like fields for grade level and educational philosophy and tag.
[26:36] Charlie Deist: I guess those are partly.
[26:39] Charlie Deist: Those are part of the architecture of the, the, the higher level view where you can filter by different things.
[26:45] Charlie Deist: But we could all, we could make them invisible. I don't know if that has any impact on sdr.
[26:49] Charlie Deist: Like could we keep those things? Yeah, yeah, that front matter.
[26:55] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I think these are good categories.
[27:00] Melissa Wurzel: This is basically getting the what parents say under the same thing as fast facts and just making that into one page.
[27:08] Melissa Wurzel: Right. Or do you want those things to also not be collapsible? Fred?
[27:25] Frederic Lee: I prefer them open. They could be, you know, collapsible available, but default to open.
[27:30] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[27:32] Frederic Lee: Just because if, you know, we're really trying to provide a comprehensive review of the tool.
[27:37] Frederic Lee: So it's, it's okay if it's a, you know, a long scrolling page.
[27:44] Frederic Lee: But yeah, it is pretty much a combination of these two.
[27:46] Frederic Lee: And I think at the beginning there's an extra. Sorry, wrong one.
[27:51] Frederic Lee: There's maybe an extra like quick, quick verdict or something like that. Help summarize.
[28:01] Frederic Lee: And yeah, this can be adjusted to, to fit what we have and. Yeah.
[28:16] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[28:24] Frederic Lee: So yeah, that's the, that's the kind of core area of Tools is, you know, we've, we've updated the title tags.
[28:30] Frederic Lee: Now let's tweak the content so we can, you know, continue to gain traffic and rankings.
[28:37] Frederic Lee: I think if we help satisfy the user better, we'll be good there. The other areas.
[28:45] Frederic Lee: Right now we're not saying that these are very important pages of our site.
[28:49] Frederic Lee: If we include them in the navigation or the footer, we will send better signals.
[28:56] Frederic Lee: I don't know if there's any hesitation against adding them.
[29:00] Frederic Lee: You can even just be like a slash tools or tools section.
[29:04] Melissa Wurzel: What's under the resources when you click on that? Is there. It's just, it just goes to that one page.
[29:09] Frederic Lee: Yeah. And then the, there's an opportunity in the footer to add.
[29:24] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, interesting.
[29:26] Frederic Lee: For whatever reason there's hesitation to add it to the nav. We can get in the footer.
[29:33] Frederic Lee: If not, somewhere under here would be great.
[29:37] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I, I think you, I'd like it under the open education. Yeah, I think we could put it in there.
[29:45] Charlie Deist: That. That's not too crowded yet. Or resource. Actually, probably resources.
[29:49] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I was gonna say under resources, didn't we used to have like, podcast, you know, whatever.
[29:57] Melissa Wurzel: Articles, whatever you call it.
[30:00] Charlie Deist: Mm, right. And then we. Yeah, I think I actually wanted that to just have the. The daily. More.
[30:12] Charlie Deist: Maybe we could also have it hover over resources again for a second. What if we did?
[30:17] Charlie Deist: Like, it doesn't drop. Oh, it doesn't drop down at all. Oh, no.
[30:22] Melissa Wurzel: And when you click on resources, it takes you to slash blog.
[30:25] Charlie Deist: Right, right, right. And then you have the three categories there.
[30:29] Charlie Deist: But yeah, I think we should do those as. Those three as dropdowns. And then maybe also add tools.
[30:36] Charlie Deist: And I might also add the tools onto this page somehow. Some kind of prominent link to the tools.
[30:44] Charlie Deist: Or I might actually work that into the email call to action, even.
[30:52] Melissa Wurzel: It.
[31:23] Melissa Wurzel: All right, Charlie, well, you can think about that.
[31:27] Melissa Wurzel: Maybe when Ella gets back to like, you want some help adding the drop downs and stuff.
[31:33] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I won't touch that until she gets back. Just because. Yeah, break it. Okay.
[31:44] Frederic Lee: And then the last area I know we're coming up on time is internal linking to those tools pages.
[31:58] Frederic Lee: In the. Oh, no, sorry. We have another 15 minutes.
[32:01] Charlie Deist: I can. Okay. Yeah, I got. I got some ideas for that, but I want to hear what you have to say.
[32:07] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I know. With a lot of our homeschooling. Sorry.
[32:13] Frederic Lee: The curriculum lists that we're creating, that blog content.
[32:16] Charlie Deist: Yep.
[32:17] Frederic Lee: Most or we kind of default to linking out to external resources.
[32:22] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[32:23] Frederic Lee: I think that we continue to grow these tool sections and potentially the marketplace.
[32:27] Frederic Lee: Maybe that's the second idea. But the tool sections is we link to our tools review as.
[32:33] Charlie Deist: Yeah, for sure. And I can do that.
[32:36] Charlie Deist: Sounds like a job for Claude Code, actually, because I've now got the webflow MCP hooked up and it can actually.
[32:42] Charlie Deist: It can go into those curriculum, Find the curriculum guides, find all the one.
[32:47] Charlie Deist: All the instances of tools that are mentioned, and then replace the links as sort of a bulk operation.
[32:57] Frederic Lee: And it could be a way. I know we talked about.
[33:01] Frederic Lee: How do we continue to personalize those lists as like, here's our representative tools.
[33:08] Frederic Lee: Or however we want to position the tools list as like a, you know, a standalone section too.
[33:17] Frederic Lee: It's like, you know, opened, reviewed tools or something like that.
[33:24] Charlie Deist: Yeah, this is sort of. I'm sorry, I don't want to change the topic until we're done here, but I have.
[33:31] Charlie Deist: I have one more thing on the curriculum or the grade Level curriculums, huh?
[33:37] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I'm good to go.
[33:39] Charlie Deist: Okay, so I, I pinged Jen Johnson, our learning division kind of primary contact for these sorts of things.
[33:47] Charlie Deist: And she, she's the one that interfaces with all of our vendors.
[33:51] Charlie Deist: I pinged her with an idea to turn those, those guides into something like that could also function as the base template that we provide new families in the program.
[34:01] Melissa Wurzel: Program.
[34:02] Charlie Deist: Like here's, you know, if your kid is in this grade, you know, here's sort of some recommendations.
[34:07] Charlie Deist: Here's our most popular. Like just to give them something so that they have no idea where to start.
[34:12] Charlie Deist: It's like an informed base template. And those would be primarily drawing from our vendors.
[34:20] Charlie Deist: Maybe we would have a few things from outside of it, but mostly trying to focus on the vendors.
[34:26] Charlie Deist: She suggested if we could do it by grade band instead of grade level.
[34:34] Charlie Deist: And I, I'm guessing that we want to probably because people aren't searching for like third to fifth grade homeschool curriculum.
[34:43] Charlie Deist: They're searching for third, third grade homeschool curriculum. Right. Yeah.
[34:50] Charlie Deist: And, and maybe it's this just the same content then for, for kindergarten, first grade, second grade and then third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.
[35:00] Charlie Deist: Like it's, it could be almost literally the same content, maybe with a few words changed.
[35:05] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[35:06] Frederic Lee: You have folks searching for like elementary education, which I think we already wrote a post on.
[35:13] Frederic Lee: Or it's in the queue.
[35:14] Charlie Deist: It's in the queue. I don't think I actually did write it yet.
[35:18] Frederic Lee: And then we do. There is search volume as you see in people who are searching for specific grade.
[35:24] Frederic Lee: I do think these, these ones especially can be a much tighter list.
[35:28] Frederic Lee: Like you don't need to, you know, creative massive piece around it.
[35:33] Charlie Deist: Yeah, yeah, I know, yeah.
[35:34] Frederic Lee: As you said, you're going to have quite a lot of repetition across them.
[35:39] Frederic Lee: But just having a page dedicated to the individual grades, you know, would, would be good for open ed to, to have for sure.
[35:50] Charlie Deist: I mean you suggested like 750 words for some of these like first.
[35:58] Charlie Deist: So it's really, it's just kind of like a list format. Not like if there's going to be.
[36:03] Charlie Deist: I'm looking the new content November where there's about nine or ten H2s.
[36:11] Charlie Deist: So that means like 50 words per H2 basically. Yeah.
[36:18] Charlie Deist: Which that almost doesn't quite add up unless we just give like the name of four curricula with links.
[36:27] Charlie Deist: But that we could do that. That would almost be easiest of all.
[36:35] Frederic Lee: Yeah. And you can definitely condense these if like you know, play based or Some kindergarten.
[36:43] Frederic Lee: Let me look at the grade level one. Yeah.
[36:49] Charlie Deist: Like, maybe we don't need all those subjects because, like, I don't even know that.
[36:56] Charlie Deist: I mean, most of that's. Yeah, we could. We could. I just.
[37:00] Charlie Deist: I don't think that I could hit all those in 750 words.
[37:04] Frederic Lee: Yep. Yeah. If you could bucket. There's like, language arts, writing and reading all together.
[37:11] Charlie Deist: Right, right.
[37:12] Frederic Lee: Yeah. And then I know we.
[37:18] Frederic Lee: This was the curriculum template, the best curriculum template for listing the individuals.
[37:28] Frederic Lee: And this will be good for, like, the tools ones that we have, but kind of. What is the name of it?
[37:35] Charlie Deist: A brief.
[37:36] Frederic Lee: What is a screenshot, if applicable, and a brief why we like it.
[37:40] Charlie Deist: I see.
[37:42] Frederic Lee: I know that'll get you to 750 very quickly. So it can be.
[37:46] Charlie Deist: But for this one, are we imagining, like, I've done best math curriculum, and I think I've done best science curriculum, and I could.
[37:54] Charlie Deist: I can redo those. There are longer pieces that mention more things.
[38:01] Charlie Deist: But are we going for, like, best math curriculum is X. Like, and just. Just list one thing or.
[38:14] Frederic Lee: Not necessarily.
[38:16] Frederic Lee: I would list the ones that we would naturally list, and I assume that they're being listed because they're, you know, decent and reputable.
[38:25] Frederic Lee: So it's not like, here's the single best.
[38:27] Frederic Lee: It's like, here's our list of, you know, recommended curriculum.
[38:33] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[38:33] Frederic Lee: Best is. Is more of a way to capture the keyword intent than to say that we're, you know, saying one.
[38:41] Frederic Lee: One is the best.
[38:43] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[38:44] Frederic Lee: And for these ones, for the grade level ones, I don't think I have best in there.
[38:50] Frederic Lee: It's just first grade homeschool curriculum.
[38:55] Charlie Deist: So.
[38:56] Frederic Lee: Yeah, those can be a list of. Of between the tools and the industry available curriculum out there.
[39:06] Melissa Wurzel: Mm.
[39:12] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[39:12] Frederic Lee: These ones can be, as we said, like, more condensed than a full best template.
[39:19] Frederic Lee: But that's roughly the structure. It's like, what is it?
[39:25] Frederic Lee: Anything unique about it we can say and then move on to the next one.
[39:30] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[39:42] Frederic Lee: Yeah. So in that kind of note.
[39:47] Charlie Deist: We.
[39:47] Frederic Lee: Were discussing these final December topics, and I got January to work through too.
[39:56] Frederic Lee: Are you guys good with me providing outlines for this batch here?
[40:02] Charlie Deist: I. I wonder if it's really necessary to do for second grade, sixth grade, seventh grade.
[40:08] Charlie Deist: Like, what's going to be different about those than first grade?
[40:12] Frederic Lee: Yeah, not much. Some maybe grouping changes, but yeah, it's.
[40:18] Frederic Lee: I mean, it's up to your discretion anyways on what you include.
[40:23] Charlie Deist: So I.
[40:23] Frederic Lee: Can hold on those ones.
[40:26] Charlie Deist: I would be curious to see if we can come up with a Good template for how to homeschool in state and for those, I think there's a balance between, I want to know kind of what the pure SEO outline would look like.
[40:45] Charlie Deist: But I would be informed in these by I think that like the, the, the state, the actual state variables and the things that people might be wondering about.
[40:55] Charlie Deist: I think when they're searching this, if I, if I had to act as like oracle of search intent, I would guess that they're maybe looking for in person, community co ops, you know, learning centers, tutoring.
[41:12] Charlie Deist: There's like maker labs and all kinds of, I mean like in all of our states, especially Utah though, there's like a very robust network of these.
[41:20] Charlie Deist: We used to call them, I think community courses or like third party provider.
[41:26] Charlie Deist: There was a designation for like in person, third party vendors and people were all the time asking like how do I get approved as one of these?
[41:34] Charlie Deist: And so I know at least in like in Oregon and Utah it would be easy to go back to my list of these and kind of pick out a handful of, and just give examples like here are some ways that you can.
[41:46] Charlie Deist: Because that fits the open ed ethos that education doesn't only happen in your house with a purchased curriculum.
[41:57] Charlie Deist: It's all this stuff out in the world. There are micro schools we could feature.
[42:03] Charlie Deist: And then the other thing that I think people are maybe going to be wondering about is special funding opportunities.
[42:08] Charlie Deist: And there's, there's the obvious opportunity to plug Open Ed and maybe mention the other sort of ESA opportunities.
[42:19] Charlie Deist: But apart from that I'd be curious like what, what does the existing content for these searches, what kinds of stuff does it actually surface?
[42:30] Charlie Deist: Like.
[42:31] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[42:33] Melissa Wurzel: And do you think that might be different by state, Fred?
[42:36] Melissa Wurzel: Like would it be worth it to us to do that outline for Oregon, Indiana and Nevada or.
[42:46] Charlie Deist: Yeah, like there's, and there's laws.
[42:49] Charlie Deist: Like when I, when I search it out, school actually has the second sponsored result Outschool Power Homeschool and Homeschool Legal Defense Association.
[43:02] Charlie Deist: And then we get Utah State Board of Education another one, an organic one from Homeschool Legal Defense.
[43:08] Charlie Deist: Moving beyond the page but like laws, I guess that's, that is another big one.
[43:13] Charlie Deist: And it's, it's weird because we'd be saying like, you know, here are the homeschool laws in Utah, but if you're doing open ed, you're not actually a homeschooler and you're not subject to these laws, which is.
[43:27] Charlie Deist: Okay, I think we can kind of take that angle.
[43:29] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I think we can figure out a way to walk that line. Yeah. But yeah, about at home education.
[43:37] Melissa Wurzel: We'll just tell them they're doing at home education, you know. Huh.
[43:42] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[43:44] Charlie Deist: Power. Homeschool is a sellers and there's a lot. They have a lot of generic content.
[43:53] Charlie Deist: They link out to some homeschool laws and requirements groups and support how to get started.
[44:06] Frederic Lee: There's definitely opportunities to link out to reputable resources as well.
[44:13] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I do think there will be a common structure of the articles I can provide. The info within.
[44:21] Frederic Lee: Each will definitely be very state specific.
[44:27] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I would say that I'd be more interested in seeing that and maybe one or two other examples of the grade level curriculum.
[44:34] Charlie Deist: Like if there are variations depending on but like maybe second grade and seventh grade but not sixth grade because I can't imagine that sixth grade homeschool curriculum and seventh grade homeschool curriculum are going to have such different header structures.
[44:50] Frederic Lee: Yeah, we already have first grade, so maybe I'll just do seventh.
[44:54] Charlie Deist: The seventh grade. Yeah.
[44:56] Frederic Lee: And then I'll throw in two state based ones just to see what the core differences may be there.
[45:10] Melissa Wurzel: And then.
[45:11] Frederic Lee: That'Ll get us through December there. And then for January I was looking at additional buckets.
[45:26] Frederic Lee: I mean I know we talked about like the state based content which we'll do for December.
[45:34] Frederic Lee: A couple of the buckets there's versus, which actually I have one of these already for December is homeschool versus public school.
[45:45] Frederic Lee: But there are versus keywords out there.
[45:50] Frederic Lee: You get homeschool versus private school, homeschool versus online school, which you know is very much.
[45:59] Frederic Lee: It can be a user who's maybe a little further down in their journey.
[46:04] Frederic Lee: They're not, you know, asking informational questions about what homeschooling is.
[46:07] Frederic Lee: They're more comparing, you know, various schooling options for their child.
[46:12] Frederic Lee: So this is kind of a campaign with a couple examples here of how we, how we tackle versus keywords.
[46:19] Frederic Lee: And these will have kind of unique structure.
[46:24] Frederic Lee: Obviously we want to be as unbiased as possible while still, you know, supporting open ed as an option.
[46:35] Frederic Lee: The next bucket is kind of, you know, specialty families or students while traveling military, digital nomads.
[46:46] Frederic Lee: Then you have like kind of various student needs, adhd, gifted, anxious kids.
[46:54] Frederic Lee: And I know there's some of this stuff is already covered within the blog and the dailies and things like that.
[46:59] Frederic Lee: So it's an area I can kind of look at what's all out there and how we can optimize or consolidate into.
[47:07] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[47:07] Melissa Wurzel: Didn't we get some of that feedback from what folks Want to see too, Charlie, in the daily, like from that social post that we did.
[47:16] Charlie Deist: I don't remember.
[47:18] Melissa Wurzel: I think Havalo was showing that at the last meeting.
[47:21] Charlie Deist: Oh yeah, there. There were a few things.
[47:24] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, it was like ADHD or something.
[47:26] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[47:27] Charlie Deist: And a lot of times it's stuff that we have covered and we can always like it was stuff that we're already doing.
[47:34] Charlie Deist: If you want to maybe resurface that in Slack, we can kind of see what we might want to put as an extra priority or bump up more often.
[47:44] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I'll send that in Slack.
[47:45] Chavilah Stowers: From what I remember, the most common comment was homeschooling with special needs
[47:49] Melissa Wurzel: kids.
[47:50] Chavilah Stowers: That was
[47:50] Melissa Wurzel: done
[47:51] Chavilah Stowers: quite a
[47:52] Melissa Wurzel: bit.
[47:52] Charlie Deist: Interesting. Yeah, no, I know. I think that that is a common scenario with open end families.
[48:02] Frederic Lee: Okay.
[48:04] Frederic Lee: And the Last bucket is FAQs and I added a couple in here and this is something I could really use Yalls help with.
[48:14] Frederic Lee: And you know what, what are the common questions that you're getting?
[48:18] Frederic Lee: It's one of those things where if you're getting the question repeatedly from, you know, potential or current, current clients, current users, then it may be worth creating a dedicated blog to answer.
[48:32] Charlie Deist: Is this reimbursable?
[48:35] Frederic Lee: There you go. That's fun.
[48:39] Melissa Wurzel: We actually get a lot of questions in that recommendations Slack Channel.
[48:46] Melissa Wurzel: There's constantly like people saying just like they get these questions from a parent, you know, and it's like I have so and so who's struggling how to learn how to read and they were diagnosed ADHD and does anybody have any suggestions on what could help?
[49:03] Melissa Wurzel: Like there's tons of that kind of stuff and I wonder if there is some broader themes in there.
[49:09] Melissa Wurzel: Might Charlie, it might be worth just dumping all that content from that recommendation Slack Channel and AI and see if it surfaces any themes.
[49:18] Charlie Deist: Huh?
[49:21] Frederic Lee: Yeah, that'd be great.
[49:24] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, let's do that. As an action item.
[49:30] Charlie Deist: I need to figure out how to access Ella's meeting note taker.
[49:35] Charlie Deist: I've been assuming that they all when one person's note taker is in, but I can't find it in Fellow.
[49:42] Charlie Deist: Well, I'll figure that out later but Fellow is too confusing for me.
[49:49] Charlie Deist: I don't know why we had to switch from Grain.
[49:56] Frederic Lee: So I'll do a little bit more digging on these ones from a kind of keyword traffic perspective and then whatever thoughts you have on the FAQs, we can put together a plan, maybe get the next few months of topics aligned at least like the higher level topic.
[50:18] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, that sounds good.
[50:20] Frederic Lee: Next few weeks. Yeah, that'd be great.
[50:23] Charlie Deist: All right.
[50:25] Frederic Lee: I know we're just about over time. Those are the main things that I had for today.
[50:33] Melissa Wurzel: I can't think of anything else.
[50:36] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[50:38] Frederic Lee: So, yeah, I'll. Let me know your thoughts on the state based content. Anything I can provide there.
[50:45] Frederic Lee: I know we're going to prioritize Indiana, Oregon, Nevada, and I'll provide the how to.
[50:51] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[50:51] Frederic Lee: For December for I think it was Oregon and Indiana. And then.
[50:56] Frederic Lee: Yeah, let me know any questions on the tools consolidation as you get deeper into that, Charlie.
[51:01] Frederic Lee: And yeah, I'll dive deeper into the January content.
[51:07] Charlie Deist: All right. Sounds good.
[51:09] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee stopped sharing their screen
[51:09] Melissa Wurzel: Sounds good, everybody.
[51:12] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks for your time.
[51:14] Melissa Wurzel: All right.
[51:16] Charlie Deist: Okay. Talk to you later.
[51:17] Charlie Deist: Charlie Deist left
[51:17] Frederic Lee: Yes.
[51:17] Melissa Wurzel: Melissa Wurzel left
[51:18] Charlie Deist: Bye.
[51:18] Frederic Lee, Chavilah Stowers: Frederic Lee, Chavilah Stowers left



[00:00] Chavilah Stowers, Frederic Lee, Ela Richmond, Melissa Wurzel: Chavilah Stowers, Frederic Lee, Ela Richmond, Melissa Wurzel joined
[00:01] Melissa Wurzel: Breaking down the big picture with is, he's like, these are five week cycles, they're not two.
[00:05] Melissa Wurzel: That's intentional.
[00:06] Melissa Wurzel: I want the engineers to have enough time to make changes and like, get their head wrapped around this thing.
[00:12] Melissa Wurzel: He's like, there really is only.
[00:14] Melissa Wurzel: I think he said it was like, I don't even remember the number 8, 10 cycles a year, a fiscal year.
[00:19] Melissa Wurzel: So it's like it makes the organization also prioritize things.
[00:25] Melissa Wurzel: And so, yes, that is the betting table. So I'm coming with our SEO ask. And to me, it can go as deep.
[00:33] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, we're gonna need a lot longer than five weeks. I.
[00:37] Melissa Wurzel: I would like to just get the technical bugs out of the way in five weeks.
[00:41] Melissa Wurzel: And then, I mean, Dave's got all kind of like, oh, yeah, we can spin up all these landing pages and all this stuff.
[00:48] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, yeah, like, yeah, there's tons of stuff we could be doing, but like, we don't even have the, the, in my mind, we don't even have like the, the health.
[00:58] Melissa Wurzel: The site health in a place where we can start really, you know, building on it.
[01:04] Ela Richmond: Yeah. So I just added 15 more minutes to our call later today because.
[01:09] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[01:10] Ela Richmond: Just to like, understand more of that and like the, the tool side of it and also the UX side of it and also like just where y' all got to up to now so that as.
[01:22] Ela Richmond: As you get updates, then I'll be updated and can just like start moving if there's anything that I need to move on.
[01:30] Melissa Wurzel: But that sounds good.
[01:31] Melissa Wurzel: I also, like, I had shared a couple docs with you guys and with Fred on just like initial thinking for like marketplace versus tools.
[01:40] Melissa Wurzel: And then I had like a whole marketplace document on technical SEO stuff they needed to fix and all kinds of stuff.
[01:47] Melissa Wurzel: I'm rolling that into an actual product brief.
[01:50] Melissa Wurzel: So I have a product brief now and I can share that with you guys.
[01:53] Melissa Wurzel: It's definitely a work in progress, but this product brief will be what I take to the quote betting table meeting.
[02:00] Melissa Wurzel: So I'm trying to make it not overwhelming, as in depth as we can to say, like, Ella, if we get engineers for five weeks, I want to run out of the gate with them like the first day and go start fixing these errors.
[02:16] Melissa Wurzel: Like, I don't want to come to meetings and talk about, like, I want all that work to be done and then we can be meeting with them about the other stuff that we don't have landed.
[02:25] Melissa Wurzel: But like a lot of what the team did in the first cycle this past time Past, past cycle was they just spun for like three weeks.
[02:33] Melissa Wurzel: It was like, what do we need to do here?
[02:34] Melissa Wurzel: What do we, you know, it's like the engineering team trying to figure out what the business needs.
[02:41] Ela Richmond: So this, this started with you going to Dave and saying, hey, there's a lot of things that are broken on the product side of SEO or how did this conversation start initially?
[02:52] Melissa Wurzel: Well, so Dave established this quote, betting table process.
[02:56] Melissa Wurzel: Now that we're out of like hair on fire, get the program stood up so kids can get into it.
[03:02] Melissa Wurzel: This school year, he wants to get into more of a priority sequence where he's positioning product resources to align where the business needs them.
[03:13] Melissa Wurzel: So this he, he started this whole process that was his.
[03:17] Melissa Wurzel: Like, this is how he wants the engineers to work.
[03:19] Melissa Wurzel: He doesn't want people throwing them into fires every day. You know, it's.
[03:22] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, it's only more systematic process. We are in the first cycle right now.
[03:27] Melissa Wurzel: So, like, they've been working on Academy.
[03:29] Melissa Wurzel: They've been working on like, you've probably seen some of this work.
[03:32] Melissa Wurzel: There are some slack channels that have been set up.
[03:34] Melissa Wurzel: They've been working on the enrollment experience. There are like four priorities, I think right now.
[03:39] Melissa Wurzel: And I kind of, I knew we had these technical issues, but I also wanted to see how the first cycle went.
[03:46] Melissa Wurzel: And now we're to the point where we're almost. So next week, next Thursday, I think is the.
[03:50] Melissa Wurzel: Is the meeting to decide priorities.
[03:53] Melissa Wurzel: And like, when you look at the big picture timeline, I'm like, we really.
[03:57] Melissa Wurzel: I would love for us to get the next cycle so we can use the five full weeks with the engineers, get the technical stuff out of the way, and then we would have like essentially a good six months, maybe even less five months before we really need to start capturing those fall enrollments, you know, because it's like it's November 1st, so we go through a cycle with them.
[04:21] Melissa Wurzel: It'll be December and then we start running paid for our fall campaigns probably around April.
[04:29] Melissa Wurzel: So good to give Google like July, January, February, March, April, like to really be optimizing all these changes that he, you know, hopefully that he makes on the technical side.
[04:42] Melissa Wurzel: And the marketplace is 95% of our problems for our own site.
[04:48] Melissa Wurzel: Like, we, we have some problems on our side, but most have been fixed. We've done a lot of the work.
[04:56] Melissa Wurzel: We can't fix the marketplace stuff that's in products corner, but it is impacting our site health.
[05:02] Ela Richmond: So the marketplace was built and then because I haven't been on any of these Conversations.
[05:09] Ela Richmond: I know that there's still like conversation around what the marketplace should look like, but the marketplace was built and people are not happy with the way that it looks now, the way that it operates or like what's, what's happening necessarily.
[05:23] Melissa Wurzel: Not necessarily. I'm not, I'm not really actually even worried about at this point.
[05:28] Melissa Wurzel: Like, Marketplace was like, like the lowest V1 we could get out the door. I mean it.
[05:37] Melissa Wurzel: But the issue is because it's attached to our site and has all these technical problems, it's impacting the, our side of the site.
[05:44] Ela Richmond: Okay.
[05:45] Melissa Wurzel: We need to figure out how to fix these things and get our site health score up so our other pages can start ranking higher than they are.
[05:54] Melissa Wurzel: Or we need to just non index the marketplace and be like, we'll get to you in a couple of.
[05:58] Melissa Wurzel: Right, like, or whatever it is.
[06:01] Melissa Wurzel: So we have a, I mean, you, you look at it and Fred's told us, like, we've made all these optimizations on our end, but our site Site health score in SEMrush is 67%.
[06:11] Melissa Wurzel: The benchmark is 92.
[06:13] Ela Richmond: Wow.
[06:14] Melissa Wurzel: The reason it's not there is because of the marketplace, so.
[06:19] Ela Richmond: Oh, got it, got it, got it.
[06:20] Melissa Wurzel: Stuff we have no control over, but yet it sort of cripples our growth strategy from an organic side.
[06:24] Charlie Deist: Charlie Deist joined
[06:28] Melissa Wurzel: And I don't, I don't want to get in the habit of having to spend more and more money on paid when we should be growing the organic side.
[06:36] Melissa Wurzel: We won't be able to.
[06:39] Ela Richmond: Okay.
[06:41] Melissa Wurzel: So that's kind of where we are.
[06:43] Melissa Wurzel: I can share the document with you guys too, which will give some, some more background.
[06:47] Melissa Wurzel: I literally just had the meeting with him late yesterday afternoon, so this is all pretty fresh.
[06:53] Melissa Wurzel: Awesome. Hey, Charlie.
[06:56] Frederic Lee: Hey, Charlie.
[06:57] Melissa Wurzel: We were just catching up on tools and Marketplace and all things in between.
[07:04] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee started sharing their screen
[07:04] Frederic Lee: And one other thing to add to that marketplace discussion, we touched on it.
[07:10] Charlie Deist: Before.
[07:13] Frederic Lee: In terms of these individual pages, and this goes on to the. Do we need new URLs?
[07:19] Melissa Wurzel: Yes.
[07:22] Frederic Lee: And the indexing question is, do we, do we want to have these types of pages?
[07:31] Frederic Lee: Do we want investment into these types of pages to generate SEO traffic?
[07:36] Melissa Wurzel: I don't think the answer to that is no.
[07:39] Melissa Wurzel: I think we want to generate traffic to Landers like, oh, here's all the recommended resources or products or whatever you want to call it for a Montessori track or what, a classical track or whatever.
[07:54] Melissa Wurzel: And that's what he was saying. Like, we can build all these Landers however you want them.
[07:58] Melissa Wurzel: Like, here are all the resources for Grade K. Here are all the resources for classical here.
[08:04] Melissa Wurzel: You know, all these different things. To me, that makes more sense to go after.
[08:10] Frederic Lee: Exactly. I'm in the same boat.
[08:11] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. It is.
[08:13] Frederic Lee: It doesn't really fit your business model.
[08:15] Ela Richmond: So I don't know why and I don't think.
[08:17] Ela Richmond: Melissa, correct me if I'm wrong here, but from my understanding, we don't actually even want a public part of the marketplace like people we do.
[08:27] Ela Richmond: I can't do much with it. Right. Like. Like they can look at and scroll, but like, that's it.
[08:33] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. I think this is where we get into the discussion on strategy and the current experience.
[08:37] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee stopped sharing their screen
[08:39] Melissa Wurzel: The current experience experience is so limited that no one would go to the marketplace and like, look around and then be like, oh, what is this?
[08:49] Melissa Wurzel: What kind of program is this? Should I enroll in this? But if. Imagine if the marketplace were.
[08:56] Melissa Wurzel: I don't want to just use Amazon, but some kind of curated, like, list of things, like Charlie's Tools pages.
[09:05] Melissa Wurzel: That's a little more toward, like, what we're going for. Like, it's curated, it's organized.
[09:11] Melissa Wurzel: There are product descriptions, there are testimonials.
[09:15] Melissa Wurzel: There are, you know, things that parents would find value in.
[09:19] Melissa Wurzel: And if you're just sitting there searching, going, oh, I wonder what resources are out there for classical education.
[09:24] Melissa Wurzel: And you Google that. Yeah, I'd love for that leander to come up.
[09:28] Melissa Wurzel: And then people go, what the heck is open Ed?
[09:31] Melissa Wurzel: So then it becomes more front funnel versus end of funnel when I'm in the program and I'm shopping.
[09:38] Melissa Wurzel: So it's like switching the strategy a little bit.
[09:41] Ela Richmond: So there's two parts of this.
[09:42] Ela Richmond: One is how do we make sure that people can find open if they're searching for these other things?
[09:47] Ela Richmond: And then two is how do we make sure that people inside of open it or our customers can find the things that they might not have found to begin with.
[09:57] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I mean, the current experience for our current families that are enrolled, I don't even think that's great.
[10:03] Melissa Wurzel: Like, none of it. It's not mobile optimized. The filtering is very limited.
[10:07] Melissa Wurzel: Like, there's all kinds of things that need to be fix. And that's what I mean.
[10:10] Melissa Wurzel: Like, there are so many technical things that I think we could focus on for five weeks.
[10:15] Melissa Wurzel: Like, we're not gonna have an Amazon at the end of five weeks.
[10:19] Melissa Wurzel: This is like a giant marathon to run for the marketplace.
[10:23] Melissa Wurzel: But a year from now, a year and a half from now.
[10:28] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I'd love for the marketplace to play more of a Role in the front of the funnel.
[10:33] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know if it's possible, but.
[10:36] Ela Richmond: Interesting. Okay, I have a lot of questions still, but I will. My questions.
[10:42] Frederic Lee: So we have the, the kind of strategy that we're talking about right now is like top tools for Montessori.
[10:51] Frederic Lee: And I think, yeah, that's a great way to bring in those marketplace in some way into a page like that.
[10:57] Charlie Deist: Yep.
[10:57] Frederic Lee: And then Ellie, you mentioned current opened clients being able to find and navigate the marketplace.
[11:02] Frederic Lee: Clearly the third bucket is for.
[11:07] Frederic Lee: I'm looking at one of these tools like first grade and vision mathematics.
[11:11] Frederic Lee: We don't necessarily want to try to rank for that very specific keyword and bring in people looking to buy that because that's not really how it works.
[11:20] Melissa Wurzel: Correct.
[11:21] Frederic Lee: That's like the lowest priority. Yeah.
[11:23] Frederic Lee: So I think, yeah, we're on the same page in terms of the priorities there.
[11:31] Frederic Lee: And yeah, making, asking dev to make every marketplace page, every one of those products SEO optimize may.
[11:41] Frederic Lee: May not be worth the resources in some ways.
[11:44] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. Overkill, biggest pain. Yeah, yeah, I agree. I agree.
[11:52] Frederic Lee: Fun conversations.
[11:53] Melissa Wurzel: There's a lot of stuff to think through.
[11:55] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, you can only imagine like Ella, you know, like the curriculum team gave engineering literally a sprin spreadsheet of resources, title description, whatever else is in the marketplace right now and they've literally uploaded it.
[12:08] Melissa Wurzel: Like, yeah, you know, he's going, who's gonna write all the descriptions?
[12:12] Melissa Wurzel: Who's gonna keep up with the copy? Who's gonna. I mean there are a lot of.
[12:16] Ela Richmond: Questions and like anytime that unless, unless somebody has like a deep education background or like really understands Marketplace for this specific purpose, I feel like that also makes it hard to build the right.
[12:30] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[12:31] Melissa Wurzel: The one question I did want to ask you, Fred, in regards to this was we had a long conversation about reviews and he shared with me.
[12:41] Melissa Wurzel: He's chatted with our CEO about this too.
[12:43] Melissa Wurzel: And we do want a way to showcase, I would call them more, I guess, testimonials like Charlie has on the tools pages.
[12:53] Melissa Wurzel: It's very scary to them for them to think about opening this up like an Amazon style review.
[13:00] Melissa Wurzel: Because he's like, who's going to curate all the review?
[13:03] Melissa Wurzel: Like, are you just going to leave it as a free for all? What about the spam? What about the bots?
[13:08] Melissa Wurzel: He's like, I don't even know if we want. He's like, we may not even get a bunch of reviews.
[13:12] Melissa Wurzel: So we get one review and then there's like this one review that sits up there and the parents Go, oh, this thing must suck.
[13:18] Melissa Wurzel: You know, there's just a lot of different things that I guess they've been talking about where he's like, I'm kind of thinking this is more of a curated testimonial sort of area.
[13:29] Melissa Wurzel: And I was like, I don't really think it matters as long as we have some sort of opinion that Google can see that.
[13:37] Melissa Wurzel: Whatever.
[13:38] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know if it needs to be called review or whatever, but that was kind of one of their.
[13:43] Melissa Wurzel: The big concerns that he talked to me about. So.
[13:48] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I agree in the.
[13:51] Frederic Lee: For the tools pages, definitely a curated list because that'll be a little bit more static.
[14:00] Frederic Lee: It's kind of the same issue as we talked about before in the marketplace of not really needing to attempt to invest in every one of those courses.
[14:10] Charlie Deist: Yep.
[14:11] Frederic Lee: It could, yeah, be a curated list of Charlie as we work into like the best, you know, seventh grade homeschooling tools or classes.
[14:21] Frederic Lee: It could be, you know, open ed, kind of curates and ranks the lists and whatever reviews they want in there.
[14:29] Frederic Lee: But yeah, I agree. When it comes to opening up the full reviews, all those concerns manage.
[14:41] Melissa Wurzel: So, Fred, I know you had some stuff you wanted to talk to Charlie about, so I will be quiet from here.
[14:47] Melissa Wurzel: That was my big update.
[14:49] Frederic Lee: That was great, Charlie. You're muted, by the way.
[14:52] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee started sharing their screen
[14:57] Charlie Deist: Thanks.
[14:57] Charlie Deist: I thought your email was pretty helpful and I haven't had a chance yet to start to dive in and actually implement those things, but I think I'm good to go on title tags and meta description now basically just review of, you know, and so you think we could use basically that identical template for the meta description for, for all the tools and we're just changing the one variable that is the tool name.
[15:25] Frederic Lee: Yeah. And the, the info obviously about it. But yeah, I think the structure works.
[15:33] Frederic Lee: And I was hesitant to like map this out for those four tools and use all of November's kind of blog topic budget.
[15:41] Frederic Lee: Unless you'd want me to.
[15:42] Frederic Lee: I could definitely do it, but I think the structure is going to be pretty consistent there.
[15:47] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[15:49] Charlie Deist: And then you also recommended that we get rid of the toggle between quick facts and what parents say and just merge that into one, which I'll admit makes me a little bit sad because I liked that toggle.
[16:01] Charlie Deist: I thought it cleaned it up.
[16:03] Charlie Deist: But if it hurts the visibility of the stuff behind the toggle, then I'm with you that we need to get rid of that.
[16:11] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[16:11] Frederic Lee: And I think as we're kind of optimizing these for review Style pages, people will expect like a, you know, a longer page.
[16:22] Frederic Lee: So yeah, I agree it is, it is quite clean, keeping them separate.
[16:25] Frederic Lee: But just to guarantee visibility, I think we can structure it in a way that makes the user inclined to keep scrolling through.
[16:35] Melissa Wurzel: Right.
[16:36] Charlie Deist: Okay, sounds good. Okay.
[16:42] Frederic Lee: One other thing, and this kind of went to your other email comment about the like hub pages versus the blog pages.
[16:51] Charlie Deist: Right, right.
[16:53] Frederic Lee: And this is one thing and we don't have a lot of hub pages.
[16:57] Frederic Lee: So this is just one thing that we'll want to keep in mind is right now we have the opened or yeah, slash open education which is optimized for what is open education.
[17:10] Frederic Lee: And then we have the supporting blog which is, you know, great detail, much more blog friendly that is also optimized for what is an open education.
[17:21] Frederic Lee: So in a scenario like this we'll want to.
[17:25] Frederic Lee: Ideally we want one page on our site optimized for this exact question or keyword.
[17:33] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[17:34] Frederic Lee: So what we could do since this one has the URL of what is open education really I would say dives into it in quite a lot of detail.
[17:45] Frederic Lee: What we could do is just de.
[17:47] Frederic Lee: Optimize this main H1 here and you can just, you can just have it say open education or principals or anything else and then we'll, we'll update the title tag to reflect as well.
[18:07] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[18:08] Frederic Lee: I can lay out some more specific wrecks there, but it's, it's a little bit open.
[18:13] Frederic Lee: We just don't want to kind of force the question in two different titles, you know.
[18:17] Charlie Deist: Right, right. For sure.
[18:21] Frederic Lee: But yeah, often the way I see it is if we're going to have something not live in the resources, it's oftentimes going to be more sales, a little bit more down funnel and really connected to a larger concept that it'll live under like we have with our open education and then our sub pages.
[18:46] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[18:48] Frederic Lee: And you can say it's kind of similar to like the state side, although we don't have like a hub state page.
[18:53] Frederic Lee: It's you know, more, more sales driven.
[18:57] Frederic Lee: And then yeah, resources is, will be largely a catch all for everything else unless we really want to create a new hub on the site.
[19:10] Charlie Deist: That sounds good to me.
[19:13] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[19:16] Frederic Lee: And then I wanted to just highlight the classical education blog that we're generating some rankings for.
[19:30] Frederic Lee: This was published in August or so. And you'll see this is kind of the growth that we expect.
[19:40] Frederic Lee: First to blog, first goal is let's get it indexed. Great. Second goal is let's get impressions.
[19:49] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[19:49] Frederic Lee: And that's Impressions in Search Console.
[19:51] Frederic Lee: And as well as here you'll see kind of the grayed out keywords is like the 50 plus that started ranking and then we want to see the growth of these top 20 or so keywords which we are.
[20:03] Charlie Deist: Okay, nice.
[20:04] Frederic Lee: So it's still off of page one for core keywords, but it is trending in the right direction.
[20:11] Frederic Lee: Yeah, you'll see we got classical education model, classicalization versus free, things like that.
[20:21] Frederic Lee: And then from there I look at Search Console, I threw the page in.
[20:26] Frederic Lee: This is where you'll kind of see the impression growth and the clicks beginning to grow.
[20:33] Frederic Lee: And I look at who is arriving at the page because now that we are generating clicks, our next phase of importance is is the user finding what they want here?
[20:45] Frederic Lee: Are they having a great experience?
[20:47] Frederic Lee: And the way Google measures that is if they arrive at our page and leave our page and go back to Google and find a new page, that's a negative experience.
[20:55] Frederic Lee: Positive is on this page page.
[20:58] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[20:58] Frederic Lee: So this is a very focused approach for this article.
[21:02] Frederic Lee: But just to show the rationale, since folks are arriving from classical Education model and classification verses, one thing we could look at is in the piece itself getting if possible a, A deeper look or a visualization of some type or something that can really hit.
[21:26] Frederic Lee: Hit those people that are just looking for classical education model.
[21:30] Frederic Lee: And then the people are looking for. To compare it to modern education.
[21:35] Frederic Lee: So any way to kind of expand this section, add any visuals, you know what I mean?
[21:42] Frederic Lee: Kind of something that's. That's very apparent. So they find what they. What they're looking for.
[21:47] Charlie Deist: Okay, yeah, good to know. I mean these were sort of. Well, I guess. No, I was thinking of the.
[21:55] Charlie Deist: Okay, that's.
[21:57] Charlie Deist: Would I wonder if you could find an example or two of a post that you think does a good job? Yes.
[22:10] Frederic Lee: Yeah, let me jump on that.
[22:16] Melissa Wurzel: So Fred, is the classical education one the one that is taking off the most out of the ones that we've done so far?
[22:25] Charlie Deist: This.
[22:25] Frederic Lee: Yeah, this is the one that I'm seeing.
[22:29] Charlie Deist: And that was also one of the first. Right.
[22:32] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[22:33] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[22:33] Frederic Lee: Usually have like a three to six week period of Google indexing and then beginning to kind of show it.
[22:42] Frederic Lee: It like will test them as limes and then after that is when you'll kind of see how it's performing after about the six week mark.
[22:52] Melissa Wurzel: Right, Interesting. Yeah.
[22:57] Melissa Wurzel: I was looking at our traffic week over week the prior week and we did have a jump in organic search traffic for us.
[23:05] Melissa Wurzel: It was, you know, and I noticed it week over week And I, I was actually like, I was wondering.
[23:10] Melissa Wurzel: I was like, oh, I wonder where that came from.
[23:15] Frederic Lee: Let's see what this says since I'm in here.
[23:25] Frederic Lee: The days aren't perfectly lined up, but in terms of queries, do you see where we're ranking for Start My education?
[23:36] Frederic Lee: Which. Is that a brand or is that. Yeah, it's a brand. Take.
[23:45] Frederic Lee: For whatever reason, Google's connecting opened to it.
[23:50] Frederic Lee: I'm not sure why, but yeah, we got some curriculum, some state pages. Blog. Or is that like a podcast?
[24:04] Frederic Lee: Guess. Or a famous educator. John Taylor Gatto.
[24:09] Charlie Deist: Yeah, he's a. He's a big name in the alternative education world.
[24:13] Charlie Deist: He was New York City's teacher of the year, and then he quit and wrote this op ed about why the school system is terrible and how, you know, it's hurting kids.
[24:26] Frederic Lee: Okay.
[24:29] Melissa Wurzel: That'S the one we had traction on. On YouTube, right? Charlie, we've.
[24:34] Charlie Deist: We may have had some with something, but. But no, no, I'm thinking that that's actually.
[24:39] Charlie Deist: That was just this guy that works at BYU Independent Study.
[24:43] Charlie Deist: And it had a similar title, though I feel like it was. It was something like.
[24:47] Charlie Deist: It was Public School Administrator Reveals the Truth About Homeschooling.
[24:53] Ela Richmond: Don Taylor Goddard is a very, like, historical figure, like, in this. In this movement of education.
[24:59] Ela Richmond: So he's like, he's basically one of the forefathers of, like, most reasons why people do something.
[25:10] Ela Richmond: He's the one that busted, like, the Prussian education model kind of thing.
[25:14] Frederic Lee: Melissa.
[25:21] Melissa Wurzel: That'S cool. That's great to see with that classical page. That's cool.
[25:25] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee stopped sharing their screen
[25:26] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, that's what we want to see.
[25:27] Melissa Wurzel: And then watch it through like we are and figure out what, you know, we need to change to make sure we continue to grow it.
[25:35] Melissa Wurzel: And then we can model some of the other pages after it once we see them start to hopefully get traction.
[25:41] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[25:43] Frederic Lee: And now that one did have.
[25:48] Melissa Wurzel: One.
[25:48] Frederic Lee: Of the higher search volumes of the pedagogies.
[25:52] Melissa Wurzel: Huh. Cool.
[25:55] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Another one would be Virtual school.
[25:58] Frederic Lee: Once that one gets going, see if we can gain some traffic there.
[26:04] Frederic Lee: I'll keep an eye on those as they kind of mature and so they look like after a month or two.
[26:11] Melissa Wurzel: Great.
[26:13] Frederic Lee: Those are the main things I had.
[26:15] Melissa Wurzel: On my end, and those are the, like, Fred.
[26:18] Melissa Wurzel: Like, those are the things that if the marketplace weren't screwing around with our overall site health score, do you feel like we potentially could be ranking higher and faster on some of that content?
[26:40] Charlie Deist: That was a big.
[26:42] Melissa Wurzel: Not really.
[26:45] Charlie Deist: Link equity would.
[26:47] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[26:48] Charlie Deist: Help, I think.
[26:52] Frederic Lee: Yeah. I think the marketplace and some of the, the crawling issues would have a site way benefit.
[27:02] Frederic Lee: I'm not sure how large it would be.
[27:03] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[27:05] Frederic Lee: But yeah, the other thing is yeah, we got to write good content and then we got to get links to that content for it really to crime and rank and start competing on the first page.
[27:16] Frederic Lee: So that's, that's the other kind of, you know, third tier or pillar of SEO is, is, are we, are these pages generating enough authority and kind of attention that the people are willing to link to them.
[27:36] Frederic Lee: There's also, you know, getting them out on social.
[27:38] Frederic Lee: I know you guys are doing all the good promotion of it.
[27:43] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[27:44] Melissa Wurzel: And this is where that near bound stuff really is even more important than us trying to just get immediate shares in social and stuff like that.
[27:52] Melissa Wurzel: That if we can get some kind of link on another to some of this content, it's basically building our links for, you know, for minimal effort.
[28:07] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[28:12] Frederic Lee: Yeah. I mean it takes time overall. Open it is a new site.
[28:17] Frederic Lee: Even though we had the inherited juice from was it my tech high?
[28:23] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[28:24] Frederic Lee: And even with content, Google is faced with a flood of content coming in from all angles.
[28:32] Frederic Lee: So yeah, it'll take time and the more competitive ones will ultimately need some type of link building to them if we want to move them up.
[28:41] Frederic Lee: But for now it's kind of let's see what traction we're getting and see how we can tweak the pieces like this classical education one to make sure we're fulfilling the intent of the, of the visitor.
[28:54] Frederic Lee: So it's sending good positive signals back to Google.
[28:58] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[29:09] Charlie Deist: Well, great.
[29:14] Melissa Wurzel: Anybody else have anything if not? I have an off the wall question for Fred that he probably not.
[29:20] Melissa Wurzel: Do you have any experience with Google business profiles? Some. Oh my gosh.
[29:27] Melissa Wurzel: I'm trying to get ours deleted or my tech high one deleted.
[29:33] Melissa Wurzel: First off, we shouldn't have a business profile because we don't have a location.
[29:36] Melissa Wurzel: So we're not even eligible for it. And no one claimed it. So I claimed it and I was the manager of it.
[29:42] Melissa Wurzel: And the problem is I can't get through the verification process because the phone number inside it is wrong and I can't get anybody to respond to Google to change the phone number and there's no way to verify it otherwise.
[29:54] Melissa Wurzel: But I finally went in and like marked it as permanently closed.
[29:58] Melissa Wurzel: I, you know, did all the other stuff that I read to do and it was like a way you can actually remove everybody from it.
[30:04] Melissa Wurzel: It should delete from the crawls like over the next couple of weeks. So I Just did all that.
[30:09] Melissa Wurzel: But I'm like, I don't know. Google's such a. I'm like, I just want it to disappear.
[30:15] Melissa Wurzel: Like we want it to go away. Yeah, make it go away.
[30:21] Frederic Lee: It's this.
[30:24] Melissa Wurzel: There's like 14 reviews on it or something like that.
[30:27] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, that. Yeah, it's. I mean I only, it only popped up for me when I typed my tech high.
[30:35] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[30:37] Frederic Lee: At least it's not showing for open ed, which is great.
[30:40] Melissa Wurzel: But yeah, that's a good point.
[30:42] Frederic Lee: Doesn't look great.
[30:44] Frederic Lee: I know people have equal amount of problems getting their Google my business page up and live and now that they are, Google's probably like, we're not going to worry about people getting it down.
[30:54] Frederic Lee: We're worried about people getting it up.
[30:57] Melissa Wurzel: I don't even know who put the darn thing up there.
[30:59] Melissa Wurzel: Like, apparently many people have tried to delete this and I'm like, well, I'm going to try everything I can do to.
[31:07] Melissa Wurzel: I just deleted it for real last night.
[31:09] Melissa Wurzel: Like I kind of sat on it for a couple weeks and made some changes on the back end but like nobody could.
[31:15] Melissa Wurzel: The public can't see them because I'm not verified.
[31:17] Melissa Wurzel: So it doesn't actually change the public facing content.
[31:21] Melissa Wurzel: And then I just sat on it and I don't know, used a couple personal accounts to go in and like tell Google this place isn't there and try and send some signals to like get it to shut it down.
[31:32] Frederic Lee: But I don't know.
[31:34] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know. I told it was an off the wall question but I thought I'd ask. Driving.
[31:41] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[31:41] Frederic Lee: No, I haven't had experience shutting down.
[31:43] Charlie Deist: I've got a run if I can duck out here unless there's anything else for me.
[31:47] Melissa Wurzel: Charlie. Have a good Friday.
[31:50] Charlie Deist: Talk to you guys soon.
[31:51] Charlie Deist: Charlie Deist left
[31:54] Melissa Wurzel: So we'll just keep you in the loop, Fred, as this other stuff of the marketplace sort of takes form over the next week or so or whatever.
[32:02] Melissa Wurzel: And I'll talk. Ella will talk more about it this afternoon.
[32:05] Melissa Wurzel: And stuff's pretty fluid and there's lots of questions and stuff, but I've just decided that even if they don't prioritize the whole thing right this second and we have to wait till a cycle in the beginning of the year or whatever it is, I did tell Dave, I'm like, I want to not index the marketplace pages at least so we can turn those off and see what it does for our site in terms of just like, you know, does it experience any more traffic or not or whatever.
[32:32] Melissa Wurzel: So. Yeah.
[32:36] Frederic Lee: Yeah. And the.
[32:37] Frederic Lee: The marketplace, from what I see, is generating no rankings, no traffic, no impressions, so it's not a.
[32:43] Melissa Wurzel: Right. It's not a lot.
[32:45] Frederic Lee: No, it's just telling Google this is not a SEO friendly portion of our site.
[32:51] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[32:52] Frederic Lee: Many sites have huge sections like this, so it's not a. Not a lot of loss. Yeah.
[32:57] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. Okay, cool. All right, y'. All, we'll have a great, great Friday. Happy Halloween.
[33:04] Frederic Lee: Happy Halloween.
[33:05] Melissa Wurzel: See ya. Okay, bye.
[33:07] Ela Richmond, Frederic Lee, Melissa Wurzel, Chavilah Stowers: Ela Richmond, Frederic Lee, Melissa Wurzel, Chavilah Stowers left

---

[00:00] Frederic Lee, Chavilah Stowers, Melissa Wurzel: Frederic Lee, Chavilah Stowers, Melissa Wurzel joined
[00:02] Charlie Deist: Good.
[00:03] Melissa Wurzel: My computer's freaking out today. I don't really know why, but.
[00:07] Charlie Deist: Yeah.
[00:09] Melissa Wurzel: It'S like, why some days do things just decide not to work? I don't know.
[00:15] Melissa Wurzel: It gets tired and I restarted a couple times and I don't know. How you doing, Habala?
[00:23] Chavilah Stowers: Pretty good.
[00:24] Ela Richmond: How about you?
[00:25] Melissa Wurzel: Pretty good. Good.
[00:30] Charlie Deist: Doing good.
[00:31] Melissa Wurzel: So, Fred, we just got. Charlie and ll know this because they're in the Slack channel. The.
[00:39] Melissa Wurzel: The company that developed our tools pages, the CMS behind them added the ability to change the title tag and the description now.
[00:50] Melissa Wurzel: So we have a way to do that in webflow. So I just wanted to mention that I. I think.
[00:56] Melissa Wurzel: I think Charlie has a shortcut that he's probably going to use AI for some kind of like, you know, sort of drafting the first round.
[01:02] Ela Richmond: Ela Richmond joined
[01:06] Melissa Wurzel: But I know he wants to get your thoughts on, like, what does the optimal structure look like?
[01:10] Melissa Wurzel: So we have a few, like, good examples to go off of and then like, we can start just ground so we can roll those pages out.
[01:19] Frederic Lee: Okay, awesome. I. We had some notes at some point. See if I can dig them up.
[01:31] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, you may have already done that. I can't remember.
[01:35] Melissa Wurzel: It was weird because the guy said in his video, he's like, well, it should be pulling the H1 title for the title tag.
[01:43] Melissa Wurzel: And then there was some kind of description they had.
[01:45] Melissa Wurzel: Oh, it was like a summary of the first sentiments or something. I'm like, that's.
[01:49] Melissa Wurzel: We didn't see any of that in there. But whatever. We have the ability to change it now, so.
[01:55] Melissa Wurzel: Because I feel like when you were looking at it, you're like, all of these are the same.
[01:58] Melissa Wurzel: It just says open ad.
[02:00] Melissa Wurzel: So I don't know if something wasn't working correctly or what, but we have the ability to change it now.
[02:07] Melissa Wurzel: So.
[02:08] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[02:09] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I did see Google trying to pull its own title and meta in some scenarios for everything what he was mentioning.
[02:23] Frederic Lee: But yeah, we should. We should force it on the page.
[02:29] Melissa Wurzel: All right, cool.
[02:30] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I'm still seeing it as.
[02:33] Charlie Deist: Just.
[02:34] Frederic Lee: The generic open end title tag right now.
[02:37] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, he said they didn't publish anything because once they.
[02:41] Melissa Wurzel: He's like, once I hit publish on the site, it's going to override everything that's there.
[02:47] Melissa Wurzel: And he apparently thinks the H1s are now the title, but that's not the case.
[02:50] Melissa Wurzel: But anyway, he's like, I don't want to publish this until you guys go through and fill all these fields out.
[02:57] Melissa Wurzel: So it's. We have the functionality now, we just need to do it.
[03:01] Melissa Wurzel: And then we can publish them all at the same time.
[03:04] Ela Richmond: Okay.
[03:08] Charlie Deist: Charlie Deist joined
[03:19] Melissa Wurzel: I was just giving Fred the update on the tools pages and how we can do the title and the description.
[03:24] Melissa Wurzel: Now we'll probably want his thoughts on optimal structure. Yeah, yeah.
[03:29] Charlie Deist: Okay, cool.
[03:30] Charlie Deist: I exported the print tools database to a CSV and I feel like if I could just get, you know, if we could just have like a, you know, tweet, tweak the template a little bit.
[03:41] Charlie Deist: I feel like when I've used. Is my audio cutting out a little bit?
[03:45] Melissa Wurzel: No, you're good.
[03:46] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[03:47] Charlie Deist: When I've used, you know, AI to derive the, the title tag and meta description, it always starts with like discover.
[03:55] Charlie Deist: And I feel like that's one of those artifacts of, you know what it understands meta descriptions to be.
[04:01] Charlie Deist: That may or may not actually be accurate.
[04:04] Charlie Deist: But if we could, could we maybe just try to knock this out in like five minutes?
[04:11] Melissa Wurzel: He thought Fred was going to look back and see if he had any thoughts in the sheet prior for this.
[04:18] Charlie Deist: Okay. All right.
[04:19] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, sounds good. We can just follow up and then once we get a structure.
[04:25] Melissa Wurzel: Habala, maybe you can help us just knock him out in the cms.
[04:27] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee started sharing their screen
[04:29] Frederic Lee: I have the initial Rex. Can you see the screen?
[04:35] Melissa Wurzel: Yes.
[04:37] Frederic Lee: This is the original tools doc you shared with me, Charlie, which is helpful. And then the approach.
[04:49] Melissa Wurzel: Is. Yeah.
[04:50] Frederic Lee: Update the title tag to open ed.
[04:53] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[04:53] Frederic Lee: Title tag opened or excuse me, from opened to the tool name.
[04:58] Charlie Deist: Oh, oh, oh, okay, got it, got it.
[05:00] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Apologize. I can, I can flush this out a little bit more. I put some recommendations.
[05:06] Frederic Lee: In my ideal world, I know this is a lot of work, but the way, the way that Google is, is most likely going to rank us for these tools.
[05:17] Frederic Lee: It's going to be hard to compete head to head for just the tool name with the real tool itself.
[05:22] Frederic Lee: Like we may, but you may not get much traffic.
[05:27] Frederic Lee: The way that I could see it being more of a unique piece of content is to come at the like review standpoint.
[05:36] Frederic Lee: So we could do like, I'm looking.
[05:38] Melissa Wurzel: At.
[05:41] Frederic Lee: I'm looking at Saxon Math right here.
[05:46] Frederic Lee: We could update it to Saxon Math, you know, tool and reviews, sometimes default title tag like that for each one.
[05:56] Frederic Lee: Because you currently do have a what parents say section on the site on each tool page, which is kind of like its own review.
[06:06] Charlie Deist: Right.
[06:07] Frederic Lee: And then in my ideal world here, I mentioned a detailed like open ED review, like an opinion on it.
[06:14] Frederic Lee: I know that's hard to do with, with AI.
[06:18] Charlie Deist: Well, I don't think it would be necessarily be all that hard to imbue it With a little bit of our unique perspective, our style.
[06:26] Charlie Deist: And what if we even, you know, if we have someone in the company.
[06:30] Charlie Deist: My thought, my first thought is either Andrea or Jennifer Johnson to serve as the avatar, the name behind it.
[06:39] Charlie Deist: We kind of apply a voice and we keep whatever they say, you know, somewhat value neutral, but.
[06:44] Charlie Deist: But, you know, still giving opinions derived from what we already have in there. Like what?
[06:51] Charlie Deist: We just kind of put a more personal gloss on it.
[06:56] Melissa Wurzel: I have a question. So I think Jen Johnson is perfect for that, Charlie.
[06:59] Melissa Wurzel: But that being said, on a broader note, we have this same issue with the Marketplace pages that all have the same title and meta description.
[07:12] Melissa Wurzel: The goal for the marketplace, obviously, is to let users rate the curriculum because it's.
[07:20] Melissa Wurzel: It is a marketplace. Like, we don't want to push any particular curriculum one more than the other.
[07:26] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee stopped sharing their screen
[07:27] Melissa Wurzel: We want the parents decide. Right?
[07:29] Melissa Wurzel: Like, if parents buy the curriculum, they think it's good for something.
[07:32] Melissa Wurzel: Like, it's not that we can't have an opinion. We can say, hey, this is ideal for these settings.
[07:37] Melissa Wurzel: But if the parents come in and say, this sucks, like, okay, you know, like, I, I think that's the goal for the marketplace.
[07:45] Melissa Wurzel: So I don't know, from a tools perspective, I wouldn't want there to be a different review on the marketplace than on our Tools pages.
[07:46] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee started sharing their screen
[07:54] Melissa Wurzel: You know what I mean, Charlie? Like, they're going to kind of need to go together.
[07:58] Charlie Deist: Sure. So, like, where will.
[08:04] Melissa Wurzel: So we do not have the ability to rate things on the marketplace right now.
[08:08] Melissa Wurzel: And that's why, like, I want to have a broader conversation, because the engineering team fixed our pagination issue, which is great.
[08:16] Melissa Wurzel: But there's, I think, a few more issues that we would love for.
[08:19] Melissa Wurzel: Like, I know they want to add reviews, and that's on their list.
[08:22] Melissa Wurzel: But, like, I plan to sort of lobby for SEO at the next product, Sprint, and I want to have all of our ideas of what we would like to see on the Marketplace pages as well as any.
[08:36] Melissa Wurzel: I don't think we need their help on our own pages.
[08:38] Melissa Wurzel: But like, anything on the marketplace that we want from a technical SEO perspective, I want to know about so I can put it in the document and get them working on it, because what they're not doing here is affecting our broader site.
[08:52] Melissa Wurzel: So I want to, like, make that case that if we can get our sort of technical SEO ducks in a line on Marketplace, it'll help everything.
[09:01] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I mean, just thinking about the bit, like the actual first principles kind of requirement, but, like, would it make sense to just merge These two things, if all the tools are, you know, things that people can access with opened funding and some of them are free, but like just expand out, you know, make this a feature of the marketplace instead of its own.
[09:32] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, I know there's been conversations about the overlap of these two things and I did not know entirely if you had a different vision for the tools pages versus the marketplace.
[09:44] Melissa Wurzel: Like, you know, were you tools seems a little bit more like upper funnel to me versus Marketplace.
[09:50] Melissa Wurzel: Like I'm ready to go shop, but. Right, right. So I don't know whether we should merge them or not.
[09:56] Melissa Wurzel: Like, I think it depends on the vision of the tools pages. What do you, what do you think, Fred?
[10:00] Melissa Wurzel: Like from a SEO perspective?
[10:04] Frederic Lee: Yeah, that's something that I wanted to chat a bit more through today.
[10:07] Frederic Lee: Like the goals of each seems from like a keyword standpoint, it seems to me what you said, these are more larger tools that can be used versus the marketplace are like individual courses that can be bought.
[10:23] Frederic Lee: So much more very bottom of funnel. Is that accurate?
[10:30] Melissa Wurzel: I think so. I mean, you have to. If you don't have to.
[10:33] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, you have to be in the program to buy on the marketplace.
[10:36] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, you're essentially right, Charlie.
[10:40] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, nobody's shopping in our marketplace is not in the program.
[10:48] Charlie Deist: Yes, but I think with a, a little bit of a reframe there, it could be the kind of thing and, and right now, yeah, the functionality of the marketplace where it has like the individual course offerings and things that would be very clumsy and confusing for someone that's coming from an outside perspective.
[11:05] Charlie Deist: But if we're also kind of imagining that it is, you know, that, that it could serve as a, a place where, you know, any homeschooler is going to, you know, shop around and it would link them externally to the sites where they could purchase.
[11:24] Charlie Deist: But no, I mean, I think right now it probably makes sense to keep them separate, even though it feels a little bit clunky somehow.
[11:39] Frederic Lee: And like these marketplace credits and courses right now, you, you can't really get to these as a non member.
[11:50] Frederic Lee: Like you can't navigate the site to them. They're not really ranking right now.
[11:56] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, that was one of the questions I had because I think they. Well, I don't know this for sure.
[12:02] Melissa Wurzel: I think they're indexed.
[12:03] Melissa Wurzel: I don't think they're non index pages and you can get there just from opened co Marketplace.
[12:10] Melissa Wurzel: We link to it like on the main site in a few places, but it's not like prominent because it is more bottom of the funnel.
[12:19] Melissa Wurzel: Like use the Marketplace when you get in the program kind of thing.
[12:22] Melissa Wurzel: We're kind of like trying to show them, hey, when you enroll, you apply, you enroll, you get in, you get your funds, then you can go shop on the Marketplace.
[12:30] Melissa Wurzel: And this is what it looks like, you know, so it's definitely more of a fun like to me you have to be enrolled the way it's positioned right now to use it.
[12:41] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[12:43] Frederic Lee: And from what I'm seeing is like these, A lot of these tools, a lot of the marketplace pages, they have the ability to be indexed but Google is not indexing them.
[12:51] Melissa Wurzel: Correct.
[12:52] Frederic Lee: We have not their duplicate title tags. Right. Thin content, not really provide much.
[13:01] Frederic Lee: And then on the tools side.
[13:04] Charlie Deist: It.
[13:05] Frederic Lee: Has the same issues, but it is managing to index a few of these tools for their names by pulling them the title itself.
[13:18] Frederic Lee: So tools has a little bit better organic visibility.
[13:26] Frederic Lee: And then Marketplace, I think also because the tools, the URL of the tools is the actual name of the tool which helps Google versus the URL.
[13:38] Frederic Lee: Marketplace are just the numbers. Yeah.
[13:45] Frederic Lee: So yeah, for me it kind of goes back to a larger like organic strategy around both of these.
[13:52] Frederic Lee: Like for Marketplace do.
[13:55] Frederic Lee: Would it be valuable for users to be able to find these individual, whatever you call these courses or providers through Google Search knowing that we will.
[14:12] Frederic Lee: We may compete against ourselves if they're very similar and really do need.
[14:21] Melissa Wurzel: A.
[14:21] Frederic Lee: Bit more content on them if we want them to rank for that name.
[14:28] Melissa Wurzel: If we decided we'd rather the tools paid pages play the organic search game for us and the marketplace just kind of sits later in the funnel.
[14:42] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[14:42] Melissa Wurzel: Well, what would we do with those pages?
[14:47] Melissa Wurzel: Like I know we wouldn't go after them heavy from an SEO perspective but like, I mean would you even suggest making them like non indexable or.
[14:58] Frederic Lee: Yeah. These marketplace ones, huh? Yeah, you definitely can.
[15:02] Frederic Lee: Just to avoid diluting the site or you know, just to reduce the number of pages that Google crawls.
[15:15] Frederic Lee: It's, it's, it's an option if, yeah, if we, if we're not, if the goal isn't to have folks come from Google to these individual courses and they're just kind of, you know, thin, thin pages used for their own kind of E commerce or whatever style purpose, then you can no index them.
[15:36] Frederic Lee: We can block Google from crawling them.
[15:39] Frederic Lee: There's a few ways that we can kind of cut the fat off the site of site of pages that won't provide value.
[15:50] Melissa Wurzel: Is it crazy to adopt that strategy right now and then as the marketplace gains functionality like the ability to do reviews, gets reviews.
[16:03] Melissa Wurzel: You know, like, we just need more information that's on there right now.
[16:08] Melissa Wurzel: So let's just say, you know, in six months or a year, the marketplace is much more robust than it is now.
[16:15] Melissa Wurzel: Is it crazy to play the tools SEO game now and then flip to the marketplace in a year?
[16:23] Frederic Lee: No.
[16:24] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[16:26] Charlie Deist: No.
[16:26] Frederic Lee: I mean it'll be keyword targeting and you know, a lot of stuff to do, but the concept of no indexing or blocking and then reintroducing when it's ready is fine.
[16:37] Frederic Lee: It'll, as with every site, it'll take a bit for them to be re indexed, but that's just kind of part of the, part of the play.
[16:46] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know what you think, Charlie.
[16:48] Melissa Wurzel: Like, I think this is probably a discussion we should also have with.
[16:52] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know if Jen owns the marketplace, but she probably certainly has an opinion on this.
[16:57] Melissa Wurzel: You know.
[16:58] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I actually, I have a meeting with her later today.
[17:01] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, well, why don't, I mean, we can think about this and just sort of take this as a to do and Charlie, we can chat about it, but it would be good to get Jen's opinion as well because I, I just don't see the value in trying to push people to a marketplace page right now that are, that are more top of funnel, like just exploring.
[17:25] Melissa Wurzel: Open. Agree. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[17:31] Charlie Deist: So I'm just to kind of to recap the, where we could get the most bang for the buck.
[17:37] Charlie Deist: Obviously starting with the title tags and meta descriptions.
[17:41] Charlie Deist: A next step could be giving them like an actual author and trying to, you know, generate, even if it is a little bit synthetic.
[17:51] Charlie Deist: I do think that we can create like a good overarching review that's not just, you know, none of it's.
[17:58] Charlie Deist: I mean, I quote liberally from a lot of other sources and I think I usually link to those other sources and I feel like that should be fair game to do a little bit of that as long as it's sort of blended within the, the paraphrasing and other perspective.
[18:14] Charlie Deist: Maybe I'm overestimating my abilities to, you know, fool an AI detector, but I think that it, that it'll be better than, you know, 90% of the slop that's already out there on review sites.
[18:31] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, I think that's, that's a great approach.
[18:36] Frederic Lee: And it, I mean, if there is someone or even multiple people in the company that are familiar with these tools, I know it's a lot.
[18:43] Frederic Lee: But even if you can get a custom sentence or some bullets out of them on the top ones of these they like or dislike.
[18:53] Frederic Lee: That would be helpful, too. It's not quite as many as I thought it was going to be.
[18:59] Charlie Deist: Yeah, we have some. We have a lot of stuff in. In our own Slack channel.
[19:02] Charlie Deist: I guess I just don't know if I really see the difference between getting the custom sentence from somebody in the company versus kind of generating it synthetically from the.
[19:16] Charlie Deist: The mass of stuff that's been written about people with different opinions.
[19:20] Charlie Deist: If we kind of, if we adopt one of the, you know, if we kind of adopt like the, the median perspective and then, you know, repurpose it in our own voice, I don't know how that's going to make all that much of a difference compared to having it come from one of our, you know, employee teachers or curriculum experts.
[19:45] Frederic Lee: Yeah, the.
[19:49] Frederic Lee: Especially for, like, larger review sites with maybe bigger companies, a lot of folks take that approach.
[19:58] Frederic Lee: And the argument is Google is looking for a new perspective, not just a regurgitation of old perspectives.
[20:06] Frederic Lee: So in theory, I know it made.
[20:10] Frederic Lee: It may be the same if you get it from an internal person and from your generation of it, but if there is a unique perspective that's written in a unique voice that's like, ideal.
[20:24] Frederic Lee: But if it's just going to be kind of general perspectives that you already get, then yeah, I agree.
[20:29] Frederic Lee: It's kind of the same.
[20:30] Charlie Deist: I mean, it's funny.
[20:32] Charlie Deist: I don't want to get all philosophical, but people are talking about how the, you know, the Internet is trending in the direction of a.
[20:39] Charlie Deist: A Xerox of a Xerox, a photocopy of a photocopy of it. Where.
[20:43] Charlie Deist: Yeah, and we're, I guess, contributing to that problem if we don't add something a little bit new.
[20:50] Charlie Deist: But it's also, it's, you know, hard. It feels like.
[20:54] Charlie Deist: Yeah, I'll see what, I'll see what I can do both gathering from.
[20:59] Charlie Deist: Just gathering some notes from our own Slack.
[21:01] Charlie Deist: Or maybe, maybe I can do the first couple and then if I'm successful in extracting stuff from Slack, then I could show Havala my process and she could do the rest of them.
[21:12] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I think I'd give Jen a voice in this too, because I view this as, like Fred was saying, an opportunity for us to show a little thought leadership here and have a perspective one way or the other.
[21:25] Melissa Wurzel: I know they don't want to push one curriculum over another. We're not asking them to do that.
[21:31] Melissa Wurzel: Ask them to put their curriculum hat on and say, what would you recommend this Tool for, like, is it.
[21:36] Melissa Wurzel: I. You know, we. We see that all the time in that channel. You're talking about Charlie.
[21:40] Melissa Wurzel: So I think this would be a really good opportunity to collaborate with her on this, and it'll bring her into this.
[21:47] Melissa Wurzel: She'll feel a little bit more ownership over these tool pages.
[21:51] Charlie Deist: Yep.
[21:52] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. Sounds good. All right.
[21:58] Frederic Lee: Okay, awesome. Anything more before we jump to the next topic?
[22:09] Charlie Deist: Nope.
[22:12] Frederic Lee: One thing I noticed is when I hit the icon here, I get openheaded. Co oldhome.
[22:17] Melissa Wurzel: Oh.
[22:20] Ela Richmond: Let me check that.
[22:26] Frederic Lee: And it's. It's indexed old home version as well as the. As well as the normal version.
[22:35] Frederic Lee: It seems to just be when you kind of go back to home and via this link and maybe other links.
[22:41] Frederic Lee: Maybe only this link.
[22:44] Ela Richmond: I think it's only that one.
[22:45] Frederic Lee: Yeah. So I think that I can't think of another spot where you would go back to the homepage. You know.
[22:54] Melissa Wurzel: How about that logo for that?
[22:57] Frederic Lee: Oh, yeah, that one too.
[23:09] Ela Richmond: Okay. Change both of those.
[23:11] Frederic Lee: Okay, great.
[23:15] Melissa Wurzel: In terms of the other, the old home, a redirect to the new.
[23:21] Melissa Wurzel: Like, how do we make it so that stops indexing?
[23:25] Ela Richmond: I just turn off indexing.
[23:27] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[23:28] Frederic Lee: Yeah, turned off indexing and updated it to regular homepage. Yeah, yeah, that should work.
[23:39] Frederic Lee: Google will kind of catch up as it recrawls. I know, Charlie. We were discussing the wild and free.
[23:53] Frederic Lee: This one. Yeah, this one just has a lot of angles. You can go with the keywords I think we saw.
[24:02] Frederic Lee: So my thought is to kind of do a.
[24:05] Frederic Lee: A higher level, like nature schooling style page for the open Ed hub and spoke.
[24:12] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[24:12] Frederic Lee: And then if at a later date. And this kind of goes to like, the tools discussion.
[24:17] Frederic Lee: Also, like, if we want to create pages specifically on these competitors, we can.
[24:24] Frederic Lee: We can focus the keywords on that directly. Okay, does that work?
[24:30] Charlie Deist: Yeah, that works.
[24:32] Frederic Lee: So I'll build out like a nature schooling style page and then the adaptive and AI.
[24:43] Frederic Lee: Not a ton of search volume around that, but we got like, AI homeschooling as like a bucket keyword.
[24:51] Frederic Lee: And what's interesting about that is when I search it, we get our smart path AI homeschool curriculum is ranking nice already.
[25:03] Frederic Lee: Yeah, we're already, like, you know, leading the pack here.
[25:07] Charlie Deist: All right.
[25:08] Frederic Lee: This style of keyword.
[25:13] Melissa Wurzel: That'S interesting about the search volume, though, that's. So it's really.
[25:17] Melissa Wurzel: AI is like really early on in homeschool, which is good, I guess, if we can get some stuff out there and capture it.
[25:25] Melissa Wurzel: Cool.
[25:26] Frederic Lee: Yeah. So I'll get those two underway. And we have ADHD And Classical here built out there.
[25:43] Frederic Lee: It's a little.
[25:43] Frederic Lee: I provided a little less on the H2 for both of these ADHD because I know there's a lot of nuance in there discussing that.
[25:51] Frederic Lee: I didn't want to kind of force keyword sections. So definitely areas to fill in there.
[25:56] Frederic Lee: Speaking to the student, to the parents.
[25:59] Charlie Deist: Right on.
[26:00] Frederic Lee: And then Classical is just a little tight because we've already done that.
[26:03] Frederic Lee: What is Classical Education Blog post. This one again is a little more promotion forward.
[26:11] Frederic Lee: Talking about Classical education, Open Education and then fill in based off of, you know, the template that you're using there.
[26:20] Charlie Deist: Sounds good.
[26:22] Frederic Lee: And then I'll get Charlotte Mason will Nature School and AI finalized in the next few days.
[26:31] Charlie Deist: Cool.
[26:38] Frederic Lee: I think those are the main things on my end.
[26:44] Melissa Wurzel: The only other question I had, Fred, is we did adjust the header to the site.
[26:45] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee stopped sharing their screen
[26:50] Melissa Wurzel: I think Ella told somebody told you. But anyway, we added the state pages, so they're there now.
[26:56] Melissa Wurzel: And we added the Open Education section.
[27:01] Melissa Wurzel: What we're thinking is not including a link in the header to all the different styles.
[27:09] Melissa Wurzel: You will like just the what is Open Education in the book for right now.
[27:13] Melissa Wurzel: We may expand that in the future, but then we'll let the links kind of play to the, to the SEO value.
[27:20] Melissa Wurzel: Just from a customer perspective. I'm not sure how many people would. Charlie wants to.
[27:24] Melissa Wurzel: Charlie's got like a quiz thing that he's going to do potentially, which I think is great.
[27:29] Melissa Wurzel: So I think some tool like that where they can use and try and figure out like oh yeah, is there a particular style that I sort of fit like if they're, you know, doing that exploration.
[27:37] Melissa Wurzel: We could look at any. At maybe something like that if we wanted to.
[27:41] Melissa Wurzel: But I just kind of wanted to give you an update on where we stood on the.
[27:44] Melissa Wurzel: On the new header for the site. Okay.
[27:49] Frederic Lee: Yeah, that sounds good.
[27:52] Frederic Lee: I saw the what is Open Education page and then you got some good interlinking into the pathways or the pedagogies built in.
[28:03] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. And we're continuing to build all that out.
[28:05] Melissa Wurzel: I think Charlie's going back and re looking at new content and updating things all the time, so.
[28:14] Melissa Wurzel: Right. Charlie getting inspiration.
[28:17] Charlie Deist: Yep. Yeah. I'll update that Classical page too because we do have a version of that.
[28:25] Charlie Deist: I don't know if that one's what's up and linked, I guess. Have we.
[28:29] Charlie Deist: Have we gone live with the what is Open Education hub yet?
[28:35] Ela Richmond: The page is live. The hubs. I haven't linked the other pages, but yeah, we. I could do that.
[28:42] Ela Richmond: Right this second, if you want.
[28:44] Charlie Deist: Okay. That would be great.
[28:45] Charlie Deist: Because we actually, I think if all goes according to plan, the deep dive today is going to be about kind of this.
[28:52] Charlie Deist: This whole. It's going to include a link to this.
[28:57] Ela Richmond: That sounds good. Is there any thoughts on updating the Open Education page?
[29:04] Charlie Deist: Well, I. I gave some. I made some edits in your Google Doc.
[29:10] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I haven't gone back to that, Ella, so I'll have to follow up with you on that one.
[29:15] Charlie Deist: I liked. I liked what you had done. I. I did make some changes. Not.
[29:19] Charlie Deist: Not structural, but a bit of rearranging and hopefully made it better, not worse.
[29:25] Charlie Deist: Never any guarantees.
[29:27] Melissa Wurzel: Sure.
[29:30] Melissa Wurzel: A couple questions I had about that, though, is I don't think, Fred, you did any sort of, like, hierarchy for the what is Open Education page.
[29:40] Melissa Wurzel: Just because there. I don't think there was a ton of search volume on those terms.
[29:45] Melissa Wurzel: And so if there are any, like, H1s we need to change or.
[29:50] Melissa Wurzel: Or whatever, H2s or whatever, like, we're still making changes, so I wouldn't spend any time looking at it right this second.
[29:56] Melissa Wurzel: But if there's anything you kind of want us to look at from an SEO perspective, we certainly can.
[30:04] Melissa Wurzel: Obviously, we wanted to make sense for the user, but you can see what kind of keywords we can get in there, too.
[30:11] Ela Richmond: Yeah, sorry, I'll let you finish.
[30:15] Frederic Lee: Oh, no, I'm good.
[30:17] Ela Richmond: Charlie, when you said that you're going to have something go live.
[30:22] Melissa Wurzel: Did you.
[30:24] Ela Richmond: Need all of the rest of them to be live? I know that we had set quite a few.
[30:27] Charlie Deist: No, no. Like the coming soon.
[30:30] Ela Richmond: Yeah.
[30:30] Charlie Deist: No.
[30:32] Ela Richmond: And do you have a plan for how you want to roll those out? Like, we could roll them out all at once.
[30:36] Ela Richmond: We could also do staggering.
[30:38] Ela Richmond: I feel like staggering could be good because then we can promote more times.
[30:42] Charlie Deist: Mostly, I'm gonna do a deep dive about each one. So there will be at least one. One new one a week.
[30:49] Charlie Deist: And I was gonna.
[30:50] Charlie Deist: I think I might batch the pages because those will all follow kind of a similar format.
[30:57] Ela Richmond: Cool. Awesome.
[31:02] Melissa Wurzel: The one question I had is at some point, Charlie wants to go into those specific spoke pages and add, like, links to the curriculum and stuff that's mentioned in there.
[31:14] Melissa Wurzel: Because right now there is no link. I think, Charlie, unless you've done that, if you have. Sorry, no.
[31:20] Charlie Deist: No, I haven't.
[31:21] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. So we want to add links.
[31:22] Melissa Wurzel: And it made me think, Fred, I was like, okay, well, we're going to add links to all these things, which is great.
[31:29] Melissa Wurzel: I wonder if there's Any value to thinking about how we reach out to these places that we're linking to and ask them to add a link?
[31:38] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know, I haven't really thought it through, but I'm like, if we're going to add all these links to these providers, is there anything we can do in terms of outreach for backlinks?
[31:47] Melissa Wurzel: Maybe it only matters on the really great sites and we don't worry about, you know, whatever 70% of them.
[31:52] Melissa Wurzel: But I just wanted to mention that to you because we're not really doing any like, specific outreach on backlinks right now.
[31:58] Melissa Wurzel: But that could be something that, I don't know, maybe we're looking at.
[32:02] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, any, any way you could get those types of links would be great.
[32:09] Frederic Lee: There, there is an old, like, badging technique that used a lot in higher ed where we could.
[32:17] Frederic Lee: I know you don't want to do this necessarily, but like, say you made our list of best homeschool curriculum.
[32:24] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[32:25] Frederic Lee: Here's a badge to making Opened's list.
[32:29] Charlie Deist: Right.
[32:30] Frederic Lee: And it links back to the. The post. So that's a way to.
[32:35] Frederic Lee: It's kind of called like ego bait type of link building approach there.
[32:39] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[32:41] Frederic Lee: So, yeah, absolutely.
[32:42] Frederic Lee: If there's three sources to do some type of email campaign out to these, these tools and providers, it'd be great.
[32:52] Melissa Wurzel: Let's think about that. Charlie, when you add the links.
[32:57] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[32:58] Melissa Wurzel: Because if we have the links in there. Fred, could you look at the.
[33:02] Melissa Wurzel: Is it hard to look at this, all the sites and be like, okay, these are the top 10 I'd go after versus like worrying about sites that aren't really that great?
[33:10] Melissa Wurzel: Or would you just go after all of them?
[33:16] Frederic Lee: I mean.
[33:19] Melissa Wurzel: Like in terms of authority, you know what I mean?
[33:21] Frederic Lee: Like, ideally I'd go after all of them because it can be your conversion rate to email outreach, like that can be quite low.
[33:29] Frederic Lee: And Google, at least my approach to link building is relevancy over just domain authority.
[33:38] Frederic Lee: So even if it's a smaller site, but it is, you know, a homeschool curriculum, school provider, it's.
[33:44] Frederic Lee: It's definitely worth the link.
[33:46] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, that's good to know.
[33:48] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, we'll look at that as Charlie adds the links and see how many there are and what we want to do there.
[33:56] Charlie Deist: All right.
[34:01] Melissa Wurzel: That'S really it. Those are the things I think I wanted to bring up. So if nobody has anything else.
[34:07] Melissa Wurzel: Charlie, you got anything else? Are you good?
[34:09] Charlie Deist: Nope, I'm good.
[34:12] Melissa Wurzel: All right, cool. Making progress.
[34:18] Frederic Lee: Yeah, looking strong.
[34:19] Charlie Deist: Thanks a lot.
[34:19] Frederic Lee: Let me know what you all discuss around the Tools and marketplace, and I'll take another look at the open Ed hub that's being published right now.
[34:31] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, sounds good. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it. Bye.
[34:34] Melissa Wurzel: Melissa Wurzel left
[34:35] Charlie Deist: Bye.
[34:35] Charlie Deist, Chavilah Stowers, Ela Richmond, Frederic Lee: Charlie Deist, Chavilah Stowers, Ela Richmond, Frederic Lee left


[00:00] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee joined
[00:00] Melissa Wurzel: Sam.
[00:36] Charlie Deist: Charlie Deist joined
[00:44] Charlie Deist: Hey, Fred.
[00:46] Frederic Lee: Hey, Charlie.
[00:47] Melissa Wurzel: What's up?
[00:47] Melissa Wurzel: Melissa Wurzel joined
[00:48] Charlie Deist: Not too much.
[00:50] Melissa Wurzel: How about you?
[00:52] Frederic Lee: Doing well. Thanks. Same to you.
[01:09] Melissa Wurzel: Yep. I know they were a little early, but I couldn't wait till October 1st.
[01:10] Ela Richmond: Ela Richmond joined
[01:14] Ela Richmond: That's awesome.
[01:15] Melissa Wurzel: Today is October 1st, so now it's like, fine.
[01:18] Ela Richmond: Are you a decorator? Is that like.
[01:20] Melissa Wurzel: Not really, but I always put something.
[01:23] Melissa Wurzel: I try to be festive with the stuff in the Zoom meetings, you know.
[01:29] Frederic Lee: Is that an old Apple computer ad?
[01:31] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. Two old posters. Yeah. Wow.
[01:37] Frederic Lee: I forgot about those things.
[01:39] Melissa Wurzel: I know.
[01:40] Melissa Wurzel: Like, you look at the stuff now and it's like, golly, those things were so cool when they came out.
[01:45] Melissa Wurzel: Now it's like, can't believe it's been that long.
[01:48] Charlie Deist: For those of you guys that are on Macs, have you. Have you installed the new Mac OS Tahoe?
[01:57] Melissa Wurzel: Not that I know of, but maybe my computer did it automatically. Probably.
[02:01] Charlie Deist: Yeah. I think you would have noticed there's a. The main thing is this liquid glass thing.
[02:05] Charlie Deist: I feel like to some extent Apple has plateaued in terms of, like, they haven't really done anything that new with either their hardware.
[02:14] Charlie Deist: I mean, they're all.
[02:14] Charlie Deist: They're still kind of setting the bar for quality in some things, but I'd like to see them do some, I don't know, something a little bit different.
[02:18] Chavilah Stowers: Chavilah Stowers joined
[02:27] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. Just haven't quite been the same since Steve Jobs.
[02:33] Charlie Deist: That is the decisive difference.
[02:37] Frederic Lee: They've got incredible brand loyalty, though.
[02:39] Frederic Lee: I don't know what it's going to take for people to move off.
[02:42] Melissa Wurzel: Seriously.
[02:43] Melissa Wurzel: It's like they suck you in with all your devices and then you have them all hooked up and it's like, ah, this is gonna be such a pain.
[02:50] Melissa Wurzel: Huh.
[02:51] Frederic Lee: Trapped us. I just a couple items to go through today. Anything on your end to start?
[03:03] Melissa Wurzel: Well, Ella, Charlie, you guys want to give an update just on where we are with the Hub spoke pages?
[03:08] Melissa Wurzel: And those will probably be going up like today, tomorrow. Right?
[03:14] Charlie Deist: That's the.
[03:15] Melissa Wurzel: Somewhere around there.
[03:17] Ela Richmond: Definitely not today.
[03:19] Ela Richmond: I would say tomorrow or the next day is realistic because I'll probably build it today if I can figure out this, this map thing and get it onto, onto the site.
[03:31] Ela Richmond: And then afterwards I'll build that and then I want Charlie to look over it, add some edits, make sure that you look over it, and then figure out what sort of architecture we want on the site.
[03:42] Ela Richmond: So that's something that might be a good conversation for Fred.
[03:46] Ela Richmond: I have been looking at this right here and so there's a few things that we need to add right here.
[03:54] Ela Richmond: Ela Richmond started sharing their screen
[03:57] Ela Richmond: And I want Your take on the best way to do it. So we need to add the what is open education?
[04:05] Ela Richmond: I don't know if this should belong in the header, but I think it should in the nav bar.
[04:09] Ela Richmond: And then the other thing that we're going to add is a list of our states that we operate in.
[04:14] Ela Richmond: We're going to have a map situation.
[04:16] Ela Richmond: But I'd also love for people to be able to get to their state a little bit easier.
[04:19] Ela Richmond: Like a couple ways for them to get to their states.
[04:23] Ela Richmond: Do you have a thought on the best navbar approach? Like, do I think our story adds a ton here?
[04:28] Ela Richmond: Maybe not.
[04:29] Ela Richmond: Like that was the one that I was thinking could most easily be pulled down to the footer instead.
[04:35] Ela Richmond: Do you have any thoughts?
[04:41] Frederic Lee: So for the open end, this is going to be the slash open education and then the hub pages of each of the different.
[04:50] Frederic Lee: Whatever we call them under that.
[04:54] Frederic Lee: So that could live like under our story, or we could update that category to kind of fit them both.
[05:03] Frederic Lee: I'm potentially less focused on how it's added to the nav bar from an SEO perspective as long as it's in there, versus from like a UX and product side.
[05:21] Frederic Lee: I might lean on you guys in terms of what the best kind of phrasing is for those.
[05:26] Melissa Wurzel: So, yeah, you don't really care as long as they're there, right?
[05:29] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I don't want to make assumptions and all that. I was also curious. Our story, how it works.
[05:36] Frederic Lee: Community, how important those are.
[05:40] Melissa Wurzel: Community and how it works, I would say, are the two most important. And then the.
[05:44] Melissa Wurzel: Our story, like Ella said, is probably the least out of all of those.
[05:50] Ela Richmond: Yeah.
[05:53] Melissa Wurzel: But I almost feel. Were you thinking that our story could go under what is.
[05:58] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know if it would go under what is open education or just open education.
[06:03] Ela Richmond: Yeah. And I'm thinking about this from two perspectives.
[06:05] Ela Richmond: One is the SEO approach, and then the other is like the experience of the person that's hopping on here.
[06:10] Ela Richmond: Like, do I think they care that much about our story? I think it gives us clout.
[06:15] Ela Richmond: Like, it's like, okay, we've been around for 15 years. That's good. Like, that really, really helps.
[06:20] Ela Richmond: But I think what is open education is more powerful than that.
[06:26] Ela Richmond: And then for states, I think that's something that they definitely are interested in getting us to, like, put on there because they want to see their state, they want to see their specific information.
[06:36] Ela Richmond: So we could put what is open education under resources too. Like under that dropdown.
[06:42] Ela Richmond: Like that could work. But Just from a navigation perspective.
[06:45] Ela Richmond: I don't know if you had any thoughts on that.
[06:50] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I mean, that. That would definitely work under resources too. Just brainstorming.
[06:58] Frederic Lee: And also like an about or about.
[07:01] Frederic Lee: Open Education could be a category where you put our story under it as well as your Open Education pages.
[07:09] Frederic Lee: The other thought is, if we're going to have these pedagogies live under Open Education, it also warrants that it could be Open Education is the main nav, and it drops down into those individual categories that's important for users to kind of be able to scroll through and see Montessori or whatever it may be in the nav.
[07:35] Frederic Lee: That would strengthen the SEO there. But again, if it. If it doesn't make sense for the user.
[07:42] Melissa Wurzel: I think that makes sense.
[07:43] Melissa Wurzel: Don't you, like, just change out our story to have Open Education and then have the states under that, and then.
[07:52] Melissa Wurzel: I'm not. I mean, our story could even be under Open Education. Right.
[08:01] Ela Richmond: Makes sense.
[08:04] Frederic Lee: The states could in that scenario be another dropout.
[08:11] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, sub.
[08:13] Frederic Lee: Sub. Dropout into our states.
[08:15] Melissa Wurzel: I don't.
[08:16] Charlie Deist: I don't know about putting the states under open. Would it?
[08:30] Frederic Lee: Thinking about how it works.
[08:31] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[08:37] Charlie Deist: Yeah. Maybe a submenu under how it works. Because how it works is about the program.
[08:41] Charlie Deist: Open Education could also have the book under it.
[08:49] Melissa Wurzel: True.
[08:50] Charlie Deist: Not to further muddy the waters, but I was thinking about changing resources, making that header be daily, just daily, and get rid of articles, podcasts, and daily as sub items.
[09:06] Charlie Deist: Because I feel like at one point I remember Jared saying he wanted the menu to just have daily.
[09:15] Charlie Deist: And I don't know that somebody would really distinguish, like, the categories of articles, blogs, and daily.
[09:22] Charlie Deist: I feel like someone who's new to the site isn't necessarily going to be looking for one over the other.
[09:27] Charlie Deist: They're all nested under the daily anyway. That's kind of like the. The brand for the category.
[09:38] Melissa Wurzel: Oh, so you'd still have them all there. You would just change resources to be daily.
[09:43] Charlie Deist: Yeah, yeah. And then. And. And get rid of the drop down there.
[09:48] Charlie Deist: Or you could even put the daily as one item under Open Education.
[09:54] Melissa Wurzel: I feel. Would that impact the SEO value of the article spread that we're doing?
[10:00] Melissa Wurzel: Because the blog articles are under there now. Would that impact SEO? I think it would, wouldn't it?
[10:10] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[10:12] Frederic Lee: And I've been looking at that resources menu too, and this might be what you're referring to, Charlie.
[10:17] Frederic Lee: But clicking into that, there's no way to get to the blog page that shows all the articles, all the podcasts, and all the dailies.
[10:29] Charlie Deist: Right.
[10:30] Frederic Lee: Right now you're clicking into just articles, podcast or daily.
[10:36] Frederic Lee: So if there's a single link that you could click that could take you to the.
[10:43] Frederic Lee: That could satisfy the SEO value pushing through.
[10:47] Charlie Deist: But do we need the. The sub. If we have that one that can. That just links to the main page.
[10:53] Charlie Deist: And let's say we called that daily or if we called it blog or whatever we called it.
[10:58] Charlie Deist: From an SEO perspective, what. What is important to have in the. In the menus.
[11:05] Charlie Deist: It's not the word resources, I assume because I don't even. That's not even like the same slug.
[11:09] Charlie Deist: And I would also think it's probably not the word podcast or articles or daily.
[11:15] Charlie Deist: It's more about having the. The slug for blog, which is the master page of all the resources.
[11:23] Charlie Deist: It's just opened co blog. Right?
[11:27] Frederic Lee: Yeah, that's. That's. That's probably the cleanest way to do it.
[11:33] Melissa Wurzel: Uhhuh.
[11:36] Frederic Lee: And then yeah, adding individual menu items for articles, podcasts and daily, those can help.
[11:47] Frederic Lee: Like if we wanted to rank for the term like homeschool podcasts, sometimes Google will rank a list style page like this or homeschool resources.
[12:02] Frederic Lee: So there is an argument that those can provide SEO value. However, I do agree like the.
[12:08] Frederic Lee: Getting the link to the overall blog page that houses everything is more important.
[12:16] Charlie Deist: And it doesn't really matter what word we put in the menu.
[12:21] Charlie Deist: Like if it were daily, but that links directly to opened co blog.
[12:27] Melissa Wurzel: I just don't think that's going to be well known from a user experience.
[12:31] Melissa Wurzel: I could be wrong, but like people are used to words like blog, right?
[12:37] Melissa Wurzel: I mean we call it the daily, but I don't know how many other people people go daily.
[12:42] Melissa Wurzel: What's that like? I don't know, like it's almost like you'd want newsletter or something. You.
[12:53] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, same thing with Google. It might confuse them as to what exactly is this page?
[13:01] Melissa Wurzel: I think this is a broader conversation, Charlie.
[13:03] Melissa Wurzel: I think this is not like let's just change this to daily. Okay. There's some.
[13:08] Melissa Wurzel: There's some impacts here that we should think about. Cool. Okay. What else you got, Fred?
[13:23] Frederic Lee: I guess just to recap real quick on that.
[13:25] Frederic Lee: So the nav bar, there's many ways you can structure it as long for me as we have ideally the state pages, the names of this somewhere in there within a drop in is great.
[13:40] Frederic Lee: And then somewhere we get at least a link to the open. Open education page.
[13:46] Frederic Lee: Those two things are important as we're passing guice.
[13:49] Frederic Lee: And then the rest I know is more of a UX discussion or users.
[13:55] Melissa Wurzel: So Ella, maybe as you work this out, like we'll just keep Fred in the loop on kind of where we've landed and like that kind of stuff.
[14:03] Melissa Wurzel: If you got any questions.
[14:05] Ela Richmond: Yeah, that, that works for me and I can workshop it and we always have the footer too.
[14:10] Ela Richmond: So like I'm not too, too worried about like taking something off of the header if people are not using it anyways.
[14:17] Ela Richmond: But I definitely want to make sure that this is the most valuable piece of real estate possible.
[14:22] Melissa Wurzel: So yeah, I was looking I think yesterday at Google Search Console and looking at the most visited pages.
[14:23] Ela Richmond: Ela Richmond stopped sharing their screen
[14:29] Melissa Wurzel: How it works is definitely up there.
[14:32] Melissa Wurzel: So if you want some direction there too, Ella, I would go to Search Console.
[14:35] Melissa Wurzel: Just make sure you're on the open Ed site, not the MyTech I because that'll screw it up.
[14:41] Melissa Wurzel: But you can go in there and select like a period of time like I was going to go in there in the next couple days and just look at September as a whole.
[14:47] Melissa Wurzel: But you can see like how it works is number two to the home page. So.
[14:59] Frederic Lee: And then Google Analytics will also give you like total views of those pages.
[15:06] Frederic Lee: Console is just folks that have come through Google.
[15:09] Melissa Wurzel: Maybe it was in some semrush that I was in and like I have both set up in there console and analytics piped in there.
[15:18] Melissa Wurzel: So I think I was toggling back and forth. Yeah, I think it is analytics to your point.
[15:23] Frederic Lee: Okay. Because I know you have two audiences, your current audience and the new audiences.
[15:23] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee started sharing their screen
[15:29] Frederic Lee: And I'm sure your current audience have a different.
[15:33] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, true.
[15:34] Frederic Lee: Play with the site. I just wanted to throw it out there.
[15:39] Melissa Wurzel: Any.
[15:40] Frederic Lee: Any other questions on the Semrush training or anything you'd like me to dive deeper in in the future or we go to the stage.
[15:50] Melissa Wurzel: Charlie, Ellie, you guys got any other questions on keywords or anything?
[15:56] Charlie Deist: No, I don't think so.
[15:57] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[16:01] Ela Richmond: No, I don't think so yet. Yeah, I think.
[16:05] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[16:07] Frederic Lee: And then we got the final September topics through. Those were a little delayed.
[16:15] Frederic Lee: We're going to get a head start on October here. Did you get a chance to review them?
[16:19] Frederic Lee: Any questions on them so far?
[16:31] Charlie Deist: These are the new ones or the September.
[16:35] Frederic Lee: These are. We had reimbursement guide fleshed out for September.
[16:39] Frederic Lee: These are the other four that we had for September.
[16:43] Charlie Deist: Right. Okay, let me see.
[16:45] Charlie Deist: I don't remember if I really looked over if science curriculum was that just added or was that their earlier?
[16:50] Charlie Deist: I haven't really started to.
[16:52] Charlie Deist: To wrap my head around these, but I think that they're pretty straightforward.
[16:56] Frederic Lee: Yeah. They're somewhat structured.
[17:01] Frederic Lee: These curriculum pieces will definitely want to try to include both industry resources and then whatever tools you have on the site that are relevant to it.
[17:11] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[17:12] Frederic Lee: But yeah, give them a look over any questions you may have.
[17:16] Charlie Deist: Okay.
[17:20] Frederic Lee: And then for October, I know we chatted about continuing to build out the spoke pages for the Open Ed hub.
[17:27] Frederic Lee: So I'm going to focus on this batch.
[17:30] Melissa Wurzel: If that works for you all, that's great. You good with that, Charlie?
[17:34] Charlie Deist: Yeah, those look good.
[17:35] Melissa Wurzel: Cool.
[17:40] Frederic Lee: I did want to ask real quick. So we have a what is classical education blog page right now.
[17:48] Frederic Lee: I think it started ranking, which is great to see.
[17:52] Frederic Lee: And that is a bit more of a definition informational style piece when it comes to these true like hub pages.
[18:02] Frederic Lee: Are you guys imagining these to be more kind of sales driven, more products driven than a blog or.
[18:10] Frederic Lee: Any thoughts there?
[18:15] Charlie Deist: I don't see them as being particularly product driven. I think there is sort of an implicit.
[18:22] Charlie Deist: Yeah, there is sort of an implicit. Like here are.
[18:25] Charlie Deist: Here are all the resources associated with this philosophy that are more accessible through the Open Ed program.
[18:33] Charlie Deist: So I guess in that sense. Yes.
[18:36] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. Because you were gonna like, do it, right?
[18:38] Melissa Wurzel: Like, Charlie was like, what is classical education curriculum resources for classical education.
[18:43] Melissa Wurzel: But then you were gonna have a section of like, I don't know how, what to call it, but like basically Open Ed and classical education.
[18:50] Melissa Wurzel: Like how you can have classical with using Open Ed. Right? Yeah, yeah.
[18:59] Charlie Deist: Yeah. We have so far.
[19:02] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, yeah. So does that classify as like sales? Do you fret? Like, what do you.
[19:07] Melissa Wurzel: When you say sales, what do you mean?
[19:12] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I mean, not necessarily like a pamphlet, but just we're going from like informational based queries into more people who are kind of are familiar potentially with Open Ed and with their pedagogy and wondering like how they would work together from like.
[19:36] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[19:37] Frederic Lee: A little, little more commercial than the other ones. So I. That in mind, I'll do the research.
[19:45] Frederic Lee: But these may be a little more.
[19:49] Frederic Lee: A little less keyword driven and a little open for how you want to position them.
[19:56] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[19:58] Frederic Lee: But yeah, let me do the research and I'll. I'll let you all know.
[20:03] Charlie Deist: Sounds good.
[20:09] Frederic Lee: Okay, cool. And then on the tool side.
[20:15] Charlie Deist: I.
[20:16] Frederic Lee: Know we had a couple conversations around the tools.
[20:19] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. I think in order our next steps there to launch those pages is that.
[20:24] Melissa Wurzel: And I haven't done this yet is figuring out where the title tags are in the cms, in the meta descriptions.
[20:32] Melissa Wurzel: And I have haven't Gotten to that yet? Charlie, I got you that reimbursement copy.
[20:38] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, but this is still on my list of stuff to dig into once Ella is out of webflow.
[20:45] Charlie Deist: Okay, cool.
[20:48] Melissa Wurzel: Because I don't think we want to launch these tool pages without you said, like, let's get the time, let's get the title tags in there and you know, those kinds of important pieces before we start attaching them to anything, I guess.
[21:02] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Those title tags.
[21:05] Frederic Lee: And then also potentially part of the discussion of where tools.
[21:08] Melissa Wurzel: Where they go. Yeah, okay.
[21:12] Frederic Lee: Okay, great. Just wanted to make sure we're.
[21:18] Frederic Lee: Make sure that one doesn't fall into the cracks or anything. And then H1 review.
[21:25] Frederic Lee: I took a look at the H1s. I know we're getting.
[21:29] Frederic Lee: Getting notifications and I saw, I saw some in Ahrefs too, around missing H1s.
[21:36] Frederic Lee: I took a look at the homepage. The H1 right now is Education at Home Made Easy.
[21:43] Frederic Lee: This is technically the H1. We're optimizing this page for homeschool programs.
[21:52] Frederic Lee: And so in theory, I know this is a big decision.
[21:56] Frederic Lee: It would be best to have homeschool programs in that H1 at some point.
[22:03] Frederic Lee: If it doesn't make sense for the brand and the feel of the page, then we can ideally get an H2.
[22:10] Melissa Wurzel: Can I ask, does it have to be the biggest thing on the page? Like.
[22:17] Melissa Wurzel: Like, could we make the H1 the number one most loved program by homeschool families in America?
[22:21] Melissa Wurzel: Would that make sense?
[22:23] Frederic Lee: Yeah, you can.
[22:25] Melissa Wurzel: Like, could we leave the design as it is, or is that going to screw it up as it's.
[22:35] Frederic Lee: Once you change one, There may be some forced fonts behind it, but there is a way to do that.
[22:41] Frederic Lee: I just don't know the specifics.
[22:44] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. Would that be better than Education at Home Made Easy?
[22:48] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Yeah.
[22:51] Melissa Wurzel: Ella, do you think you can look into that?
[22:54] Ela Richmond: Yeah, I can definitely look into that.
[23:02] Melissa Wurzel: Because I don't think you're going to want to put homeschool in that. In that big copy.
[23:07] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, I just don't think we can position ourselves like that. Like.
[23:11] Melissa Wurzel: No, we can in the magic world of Google, because people get served and Google with our partners and stuff, and they'll be like, oh, the Google robot did that.
[23:18] Melissa Wurzel: They don't know that we're actually making those decisions behind the scenes.
[23:24] Melissa Wurzel: I'm just wondering if there's a way to use what we currently have on the page but satisfy the SEO.
[23:30] Ela Richmond: There should be. I should be able to create like a. An H2 that's like really?
[23:36] Ela Richmond: I mean, I could even create an H1 that has very specific types of font size.
[23:43] Ela Richmond: It's like a very specific purpose, so that shouldn't be an issue.
[23:47] Ela Richmond: Fred, is there anything that I should be cautious about with in doing that or is. Is.
[23:58] Frederic Lee: Not really like, if we could make that the H1 and make this the H2.
[24:04] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, great.
[24:06] Frederic Lee: That would be helpful.
[24:11] Melissa Wurzel: That'd be the easiest thing if we can get it to work in webflow lo.
[24:14] Melissa Wurzel: Without changing the design, you know.
[24:17] Ela Richmond: No, for sure.
[24:19] Melissa Wurzel: We can get some more juice out of that. That'd be great.
[24:23] Frederic Lee: Yeah. And then how Open Ed works looks good. The book page kind of similar thing. That is the main.
[24:37] Frederic Lee: The main title here. Open Education. Was that always. Did it always say Open Education right there?
[24:51] Frederic Lee: That's weird.
[24:57] Melissa Wurzel: It's always been like that, right? Ella, you didn't modify that recently.
[25:03] Frederic Lee: For some reason. I just saw get your copy of the number one bestseller. Maybe I'm.
[25:08] Frederic Lee: I might be losing my mind here. So that's good.
[25:12] Ela Richmond: Only whenever we have. Yeah, it was. It was different. I. I don't know why. That different?
[25:23] Ela Richmond: No, that we changed this whenever we swapped from an event to just like a book lander, but it's always been get your copy of the number one bestseller.
[25:33] Ela Richmond: It's possible that I just came through and was like, let me just add the title of the book at some point.
[25:38] Ela Richmond: If that wasn't there, I would have totally done that. If that wasn't there.
[25:43] Melissa Wurzel: Well, good. Glad you did it because he was going to ask you to do it anyway, so. Great.
[25:47] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Yeah. I might just be losing it.
[25:50] Frederic Lee: Oh, I think what happened was I looked in here and there's a space between bestseller and open education.
[25:55] Ela Richmond: Yeah, that's the other thing I was going to say.
[25:57] Ela Richmond: It's possible that because they have different properties, one's a text band, the other one is a different, like, color.
[26:04] Melissa Wurzel: So you want open education in the H1, right, Fred?
[26:08] Frederic Lee: Well, it's technically still is in the H1.
[26:11] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[26:13] Frederic Lee: It's just kind of a longer H1, which is fine. Yeah, my fault there.
[26:18] Frederic Lee: I zipped through that one too quick. Okay, we're good. The blog pages look good for their H1s.
[26:29] Frederic Lee: The state pages. Let me make sure I didn't overlook this one.
[26:37] Melissa Wurzel: You know, we could do the same thing to these if you want to.
[26:40] Melissa Wurzel: Ella, I know you're working on the state landers, but, like, we literally could take that tagline from the homepage and do number one homeschool program in Oregon or what?
[26:50] Melissa Wurzel: However you want. To do like that, you know, in a.
[26:53] Melissa Wurzel: And just change it to the state as opposed to America.
[26:56] Melissa Wurzel: If you want to try and get that in the H1, that should be doable.
[27:03] Frederic Lee: Yeah, it'd be great.
[27:04] Ela Richmond: I am going to change some of this information, Fred, just like already.
[27:08] Ela Richmond: As a heads up, I want to add a couple more things here.
[27:14] Ela Richmond: Is there anything that initially stands out to you as we need to add something so I can think about that as I add more to this page.
[27:26] Frederic Lee: And from a foundational keyword level, we are trying to optimize these for like best homeschooling programs.
[27:36] Frederic Lee: Obviously there's language there that doesn't quite mix, but any other ways we can mention homeschooling and homeschooling programs within here would be great.
[27:47] Frederic Lee: I know we're going to add potentially an H1 up here, but any, any sections dedicated to homeschooling and like how this works within the homeschooling realm would be helpful.
[28:00] Melissa Wurzel: Cool. So you want those keywords in like, does it matter Which?
[28:05] Melissa Wurzel: Like a H2, H3, just as long as they're on the page.
[28:08] Frederic Lee: Or ideally an H2.
[28:11] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[28:11] Frederic Lee: More directly speaks to homeschooling programs would just help kind of tie the page together.
[28:17] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[28:26] Frederic Lee: And even maybe an FAQ dedicated directly to homeschooling full too.
[28:36] Frederic Lee: There's much homeschooling language on the page when we're trying to optimize for that keyword. So.
[28:50] Frederic Lee: Yeah, incorporating homeschooling programs there. And then the tools, the tools look fine.
[28:57] Frederic Lee: They're just. The H1 is the name of the tool at the moment.
[29:01] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[29:03] Frederic Lee: The ones that are missing, I saw where the marketplace pagination pages.
[29:10] Melissa Wurzel: I.
[29:10] Melissa Wurzel: I put that ticket in with a product team and like, I'm following it right now, but I'm hoping the on call engineers over the next couple of weeks are going to be able to tackle it.
[29:23] Melissa Wurzel: Our chief technology officer looked at the ticket and all the details that I sent him and he's like, this should probably be a pretty easy fix because it seemed like it was in the template.
[29:33] Melissa Wurzel: So hopefully that'll be fixed here like in the next week or two. So. Okay. Awesome.
[29:42] Frederic Lee: So that'll help clean up exactly errors that were our tools are flagging.
[29:47] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[29:51] Frederic Lee: Cool. Anything on the H1 side on yalls and makes sense.
[29:59] Ela Richmond: Makes sense.
[30:00] Melissa Wurzel: I think it makes sense. Cool.
[30:03] Frederic Lee: Those were the main things I had on my end.
[30:08] Melissa Wurzel: Charlie, did you have anything else? You good? I think you said you had emailed Fred about something.
[30:13] Melissa Wurzel: Are you good?
[30:15] Charlie Deist: I'm good.
[30:16] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. All right. Cool. Well, I think we're good.
[30:19] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee stopped sharing their screen
[30:20] Melissa Wurzel: So Fred, we'll keep you in the loop as we get the state landers added to the site, the map that Ella's working on and then like just the.
[30:29] Melissa Wurzel: The redo of the sort of header and where everything's going to live. And.
[30:35] Ela Richmond: Just a quick question. So I'm doing an embed for the state stuff. The part of that.
[30:43] Ela Richmond: So there's two parts of this, the state information.
[30:45] Ela Richmond: One is a dropdown that has access to all of our state individual landers and that will allow people to like navigate.
[30:51] Ela Richmond: The other one is an embed.
[30:53] Ela Richmond: Do I have to think about anything specific for the embedded in order to make sure that that is Google friendly or.
[30:59] Ela Richmond: No, because it's going to come from a site that's pretty reputable called Mapbox and I'm trying to build that out but just wanted to also ask about that.
[31:04] Charlie Deist: Charlie Deist left
[31:10] Frederic Lee: And that'll be an embedded like map of the US with the little dots.
[31:15] Ela Richmond: Yeah.
[31:16] Frederic Lee: Okay. I would say the main thing is like the H2 that accompanies that.
[31:25] Frederic Lee: It's pretty straightforward, like open at available states or some.
[31:31] Frederic Lee: I can give you some phrasing around that.
[31:34] Frederic Lee: Google's actually going to have trouble kind of crawling a map box like that.
[31:38] Frederic Lee: But the states listed in the nav.
[31:44] Frederic Lee: So that's all I can think of right now is an H2 that accompanies it.
[31:47] Melissa Wurzel: That's great. Perfect.
[31:52] Ela Richmond: Thanks.
[31:53] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Sorry Melissa, you're muted.
[31:57] Melissa Wurzel: Sorry. Are you.
[31:58] Melissa Wurzel: When you push the map live, Ella, are you thinking about taking away the copy on the homepage that lists like we currently operate in these states or are you thinking about making those links to the pages too?
[32:10] Ela Richmond: What I'll probably do, I just.
[32:12] Ela Richmond: I need to see it and how it works and make sure that my assumptions are held true.
[32:18] Ela Richmond: So like how the map will work itself. But my thought is that I'm going to create a new section.
[32:23] Ela Richmond: So I'll have like a one of a kind program.
[32:26] Ela Richmond: I'll shorten that sentence underneath it so it won't list all the states and it'll have like 100% tuition free, all that stuff.
[32:33] Ela Richmond: And then underneath I'll have a section for the states we operate in and make a clear delineation between Open Ed and the Academy and kind of like a quick but simple enough explanation where it's mostly focused on Open Ed program, but there's a mention of the Academy in case somebody doesn't live in an Open Ed program state.
[32:56] Ela Richmond: Because I think that that was the idea behind doing that. And Then from there having a way.
[33:04] Ela Richmond: My hope is that I can have a way for people to click on their state and it takes them straight to the lander.
[33:10] Ela Richmond: But I'm going to see if that's feasible.
[33:13] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, that sounds good.
[33:16] Ela Richmond: The hardest part is going to be figuring out how to do the academy simultaneously with it.
[33:21] Ela Richmond: Just because.
[33:22] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I was just going to say if that holds it up. Table the academy. Like, we. You know what I mean?
[33:29] Melissa Wurzel: Like, we want to get the state pages in the nav ASAP, to get Google recognizing it to help with Q2.
[33:37] Melissa Wurzel: So I don't. You could do like a phase one. Phase two.
[33:40] Melissa Wurzel: I know you kind of have to solve the problem at the same time.
[33:42] Melissa Wurzel: You don't want to, like, rebuild everything after you do phase one, but.
[33:47] Ela Richmond: No, no, that's. That's so much easier. I literally can. Yeah, I can do that asap.
[33:52] Frederic Lee: The.
[33:52] Ela Richmond: The harder part was the academy, and if that's not.
[33:55] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, let's shove that for now. Let's just do phase one and phase two.
[33:58] Melissa Wurzel: We'll get the states up there, and then we'll put the other on. On the backlog and work toward it.
[34:03] Ela Richmond: Okay, that's awesome. Thanks.
[34:05] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[34:09] Melissa Wurzel: Because we still have the thing when they fill out, like, let's just say they went to the page and then they selected their state and they did fill out the app form, they're still going to get that thank you page that then directs them to the Academy.
[34:20] Melissa Wurzel: Right. Like, it's like, hey, you might still.
[34:23] Ela Richmond: Be interested in this.
[34:24] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it. I think we've got the touch points built in. Cool. Okay, cool.
[34:35] Melissa Wurzel: I think that's about it. So we'll keep you in the loop, Fred. We got lots of stuff going on.
[34:41] Ela Richmond: Great, thanks.
[34:42] Frederic Lee: Yeah, sounds good.
[34:43] Melissa Wurzel: Well, all right, thanks. Bye.
[34:46] Melissa Wurzel, Frederic Lee, Ela Richmond, Chavilah Stowers: Melissa Wurzel, Frederic Lee, Ela Richmond, Chavilah Stowers left

[00:00] Frederic Lee, Ops Team's AI Notetaker, Melissa Wurzel, Chavilah Stowers, Charlie Deist: Frederic Lee, Ops Team's AI Notetaker, Melissa Wurzel, Chavilah Stowers, Charlie Deist joined
[00:30] Melissa Wurzel: Hey, how's it going?
[00:33] Frederic Lee: Good, how are you?
[00:34] Melissa Wurzel: Good. Good.
[00:37] Frederic Lee: To hear.
[00:38] Melissa Wurzel: Hey Charlie.
[00:42] Frederic Lee: How'S the week going?
[00:44] Charlie Deist (1): It's going pretty well. How about you?
[00:47] Frederic Lee: Pretty good. Yeah, no complaints.
[00:53] Melissa Wurzel: I don't think Ella is joining us today. She's on the road in Kansas, so.
[00:57] Frederic Lee: Okay.
[00:58] Melissa Wurzel: Sounds fun, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's making the rounds in Wichita.
[01:06] Frederic Lee: Oh yeah?
[01:07] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[01:07] Frederic Lee: Visiting family or what?
[01:09] Melissa Wurzel: No, we actually have a, an on ground event tomorrow for some of our families.
[01:15] Melissa Wurzel: And then she went out there just at the beginning of the week to kind of make the rounds with the micro school schools and just check in on some of the homeschool moms and get some feedback and things like that.
[01:25] Frederic Lee: So great.
[01:28] Charlie Deist (1): If she, if she was going to be in Kansas City, I would start breaking into show tunes.
[01:33] Frederic Lee: Oklahoma.
[01:34] Charlie Deist (1): You know, everything's up to date in Kansas City. I think that's still true. Well, cool.
[01:46] Frederic Lee: I guess we can kick it off then. I had a few items in an agenda.
[01:52] Frederic Lee: Is there anything on your end before we jump in?
[01:54] Melissa Wurzel: There's just a couple of technical SEO things I want to get your opinion on.
[01:59] Melissa Wurzel: But we, I think you have some technical stuff too. So whenever we get to that section.
[02:05] Frederic Lee: Yeah, yeah, I'll. I'll just make my way through here and that'll be the third point or so.
[02:10] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. Yeah.
[02:12] Charlie Deist (1): And then I would just say I'm, I'm plugging away on a lot of what is open or you know, the Montessori.
[02:23] Charlie Deist (1): Montessori curriculum.
[02:26] Charlie Deist (1): I'm following your header structures and I was curious to understand better what you were saying about what Google had changed because I'm not sure that I totally grocked that, but yeah, great.
[02:36] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee started sharing their screen
[02:39] Frederic Lee: Okay. Yeah, I'll cover that too. So yeah, you mentioned you're working through the August recs.
[02:48] Frederic Lee: The next step here for me so I can get on September is just a thumbs up on these four topics.
[02:59] Frederic Lee: We're going to move from kind of those pedagogy style pieces into a few of the higher volume pieces on the content plan.
[03:10] Frederic Lee: These follow mostly curriculum style. These are mostly curriculum style.
[03:18] Frederic Lee: And then a larger how to homeschool piece. I think these will.
[03:22] Frederic Lee: We're already doing great for that older guide you wrote that was about free curriculum.
[03:29] Frederic Lee: So I'd like to get into the subtopics of math curriculum, science curriculum, and then the best curriculum piece.
[03:36] Frederic Lee: Quite a lot of search around these in this space. So any thoughts.
[03:42] Charlie Deist (1): Things, curriculum ones. Would it make sense to do like free math curriculum?
[03:47] Charlie Deist (1): And then I was even thinking we could still deliver on that headline while including non free options.
[03:54] Charlie Deist (1): If we sort of couch it in a little bit of terms of like, you know, here's.
[03:59] Charlie Deist (1): You can get these at no cost if you're in these states.
[04:02] Charlie Deist (1): And if you're not in these states, maybe you could look into Senator rent free.
[04:11] Charlie Deist (1): If it's niche enough to be going down into one subject, then we can leave that word out of the title.
[04:19] Melissa Wurzel: Mm.
[04:20] Frederic Lee: Let me do some digging as I, as I take a closer look at the keywords for this piece.
[04:25] Frederic Lee: Either have a headline or it'll be at one of the core sections of it.
[04:30] Charlie Deist (1): Okay, cool. And then what was my other thought?
[04:39] Melissa Wurzel: I can think of is, and we had a little bit of discussion on this, on the email was that. What was it?
[04:47] Melissa Wurzel: There was some kind of piece that we had on the.
[04:50] Melissa Wurzel: I guess that was the MyTech High piece of like what was reimbursable. Is that what that was?
[04:55] Melissa Wurzel: That was getting some of the click volume right?
[04:58] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[04:59] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. The reimbursement guide. Yeah. Okay, great. Perfect. That was the other thing that I remembered.
[05:05] Frederic Lee: Yeah. So I mapped this out.
[05:07] Frederic Lee: One thing is I tried to dig up the old reimbursement guide through like the Wayback Machine.
[05:13] Frederic Lee: I couldn't quite land on it.
[05:16] Melissa Wurzel: So it's. This is going to get a little tricky.
[05:18] Melissa Wurzel: So I definitely want to spend some time talking about this.
[05:20] Melissa Wurzel: Our old like reimbursement guide, I guess if that's what it was labeled, literally was an Excel sheet of items that opened, would approve for reimbursement.
[05:31] Melissa Wurzel: And we're. We're trying to get away from that, from potential legal issues in certain states.
[05:38] Melissa Wurzel: So I think we're going to need to couch this in like, we have some language we've developed that we can certainly use in this that's like items like, like.
[05:47] Melissa Wurzel: And then we have categories where we say these are mostly approved items that will never be reimbursed or these like.
[05:55] Melissa Wurzel: I think we're going to have to be a little bit more general with this and I guess I.
[06:02] Melissa Wurzel: And we still need to sort of look at it through the lens of this. Could be.
[06:07] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, I'm guessing the people still clicking on this are like current customers, I guess, that have this link saved somewhere or something.
[06:15] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know how they're getting to this link, but they're still using it.
[06:19] Melissa Wurzel: So I'm like, how do we sort of use the reim. It's a question.
[06:24] Melissa Wurzel: Everyone has like a new family, a current family. Like, what can I basically send in for approved.
[06:31] Melissa Wurzel: You know, what's going to get Approved and what's not.
[06:33] Melissa Wurzel: So we're just going to need to walk the line here, is what I'm saying.
[06:37] Melissa Wurzel: Like, I want to include enough that we get play out of it, but if we can include enough, like, this is kind of where we'll need your guidance, Fred.
[06:45] Melissa Wurzel: Like, if we have to be super general about this stuff, is it even worth doing? You know what I mean?
[06:50] Melissa Wurzel: Like.
[06:50] Frederic Lee: Yeah.
[06:52] Frederic Lee: So what I was seeing through the data that you flagged is right now, people or over the past month or two have been searching for things like my tech high reimbursement, but getting nothing because that page is redirected.
[07:08] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[07:08] Frederic Lee: So then they go and search open ed reimbursement and they don't find a page. So right now we have.
[07:14] Frederic Lee: You don't have any option for them.
[07:15] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[07:16] Frederic Lee: I did see a keyword that was around my tech high reimbursement PDF also.
[07:21] Frederic Lee: So that is definitely relevant to your first point.
[07:26] Frederic Lee: So I think having a type of page that's optimized for Open plus reimbursement, there's a lot of freedom on what.
[07:33] Frederic Lee: What you can do on that page.
[07:35] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[07:35] Frederic Lee: This is less of, I would say, like a true SEO piece, and it's more of a, you know, your clients are looking for a specific thing.
[07:43] Frederic Lee: Make sure.
[07:44] Melissa Wurzel: Like information. Yeah. Okay, great.
[07:47] Frederic Lee: If these, you know, I did include PDF as a section here. If these H2s make sense, use them.
[07:54] Frederic Lee: If they don't, don't. But we just need a presence.
[07:57] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, that sounds great. That makes sense to you, Charlie?
[08:03] Charlie Deist (1): Yeah, it does. And I think we can give substantial information without.
[08:10] Melissa Wurzel: Doing a list. Anything with the.
[08:13] Charlie Deist (1): On the legal side, I know for the charter school program that we just enrolled my daughter in, they do put the information behind, like, it's only available to parents through a login.
[08:26] Charlie Deist (1): But again, I think we can give the broad strokes.
[08:29] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[08:32] Frederic Lee: My gut was that it's all current clients.
[08:35] Melissa Wurzel: Probably. Yeah.
[08:36] Frederic Lee: If you want to have a page that, you know you need to log in or something for, then.
[08:45] Melissa Wurzel: Go ahead, Charlie.
[08:45] Charlie Deist (1): I wonder if it is entirely current clients, because if they're searching my tech high, they're probably kind of getting word of mouth from people are still using the old name.
[08:55] Charlie Deist (1): And I can imagine a lot of families, if they're curious or hearing about it, the first thing they want to know is what, you know, what gets reimbursed.
[09:02] Frederic Lee: So.
[09:04] Charlie Deist (1): I would get that. It includes some prospects too.
[09:08] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. And we can include a. A link to parent link and just say, like, we'll have to couch it.
[09:16] Melissa Wurzel: And that you know, when you sign up and you get a login, you can log in and view more details on parent link or something like that.
[09:24] Melissa Wurzel: Although I think they're pretty vague there too. We can look at the content on those pages as well.
[09:32] Frederic Lee: Got it. See, I felt like it was valuable to some folks and they're going back to find it again.
[09:38] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. So yeah, there's been a lot of conversation on social about it too.
[09:42] Melissa Wurzel: It's like, does anybody have the list of approved things this year?
[09:45] Melissa Wurzel: You know, it's like some of that stuff. And yeah, people are like, no, they're not doing it.
[09:49] Melissa Wurzel: And they're like, why? You know, I mean, you know, it's some of that stuff.
[09:54] Frederic Lee: Okay, well, good. Yeah, it sounds like, you know, there's some, some things to figure out.
[10:01] Frederic Lee: But yeah, as long as we get a page with a presence that'll satisfy that ongoing search.
[10:08] Frederic Lee: So I can move forward on these.
[10:11] Frederic Lee: Charlie, did you say you had another bit of feedback or question on this? No.
[10:16] Charlie Deist (1): Well, yeah, so my other, my other question I guess was beyond the headers, you gave some good pointers.
[10:22] Charlie Deist (1): Like the idea that for, you know, specific, like our tools pages where we have those curricula and there's one, one page per curricula that it would be better to have, you know, like one author.
[10:35] Charlie Deist (1): And you know, I guess I'm wondering from an actual kind of perspective if there are other tips that you can offer beyond just like length and outline, what kinds of, what kind of maybe writing style or just other things that we might not be thinking of.
[10:53] Frederic Lee: Mm, yeah, let me, let me think about that too as I, as I go into these and I'll add that in because I'll flush all these out into the outline and I'll add it into here if there's anything that really stands out to me.
[11:19] Charlie Deist (1): Sounds good.
[11:24] Frederic Lee: Okay, that's the first. The next one was the Google Update. Should we move on to that?
[11:40] Frederic Lee: I'm trying to figure out. I don't really have anything to share with us. We can just chat through it.
[11:42] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee stopped sharing their screen
[11:46] Frederic Lee: So it's a little bit of a not technical but just kind of nuanced thing that Google did.
[11:53] Frederic Lee: So tools such as Semrush And Ahrefs, there's third party SEO tools and tools such as LLMs, they would scrape Google search results to understand what is ranking for a certain keyword.
[12:09] Frederic Lee: For our SEO tools it would help us with like rank tracking so we know where we are for a certain keyword.
[12:15] Frederic Lee: And for the LLMs, they would scrape the links and then Scrape the content on those links for retrieving information to share with users.
[12:27] Frederic Lee: The way they did that was.
[12:30] Melissa Wurzel: These.
[12:30] Frederic Lee: Tools all aren't just doing manual searches. They all have automated processes.
[12:36] Frederic Lee: And they attach in the URL parameter this number equals 100 to the keyword, which would show them 100 search results for one search.
[12:45] Frederic Lee: So that's how these tools, a lot of the tools will tell you you're ranking from 1 to 100, and the LLMs would use it to get the top 100 results.
[12:54] Frederic Lee: And this was just a fast way to understand what's ranking and what Google ranks for any type of keyword.
[13:01] Frederic Lee: Google quietly, without mentioning anything, last week removed that parameter's ability.
[13:08] Frederic Lee: So now you can only see 10 results for every keyword, which, you know, stifles LLM's ability to research topics fully and retrieve information.
[13:18] Frederic Lee: And then for the AI ranking tools, it hurts them and their ability to tell us what our keywords are ranking for 10 spot or page one.
[13:31] Frederic Lee: Google hasn't announced anything about this yet. They're saying it's.
[13:35] Frederic Lee: It's a way that Google is trying to fight back against their search results being used for LLMs that aren't part of their business.
[13:46] Frederic Lee: I think they obviously, their algorithm and the amount of energy and servers they use to structure the whole Internet, they feel is being abused by these tools.
[13:57] Frederic Lee: I think the SEO tools are kind of just caught in the crossfire between the LLMs and Google.
[14:05] Frederic Lee: But effectively, what that has done to pretty much all sites, and you'll see it, you'll see it a bit on opened here is this drop in impressions, the purple line here, which we rebounded a bit, that's just for the growth of the site in some ways.
[14:23] Frederic Lee: But all these sites, all the sites I work on shop and impressions, and the reason that happened is all of the.
[14:32] Frederic Lee: And it shows us clearly now, all of these AI tools were crawling so much of the search results that people were being credited for an impression, even though it's just an automated AI tool that's crawling the site, because an impression is when the user had the ability to click your link, saw your link, but didn't click it.
[14:55] Frederic Lee: So that's why everyone's seeing this massive drop in impressions to those impressions were inflated in the past based off of the AI tools.
[15:04] Frederic Lee: And so it's in some ways people are saying it shows Google Search Console is now showing us more real data, not inflated impressions.
[15:15] Frederic Lee: What like actual customers are doing versus a flood of AI crawling tools. So, yeah, I'll pause there.
[15:24] Frederic Lee: That's kind of the main.
[15:27] Melissa Wurzel: Fred, are you guys seeing anything? Like, this whole time this AI thing has been rapidly developing.
[15:33] Melissa Wurzel: It's like I actually don't Google as much stuff anymore and I find myself using the AI tools.
[15:42] Melissa Wurzel: And so I'm kind of like, do you think that some of this is their attempt to sort of control?
[15:47] Melissa Wurzel: Like, I mean, at some point they potentially could become outdated. Right.
[15:53] Melissa Wurzel: Like, through this whole thing, are you seeing, like, can you see it like a broad level?
[15:59] Melissa Wurzel: If the Google search volume has gone down to compete with the AI tools? Like.
[16:08] Frederic Lee: The AI tools are definitely on the rise in terms of the number of users.
[16:12] Frederic Lee: From what I've seen and what thought leaders have done the research on, is that Google has so much traffic, so many users that it's just a blip for Google.
[16:23] Frederic Lee: A huge increase for AI tools there, you know, percent increase for Google, it's a 3,5% blip.
[16:29] Frederic Lee: Like it's barely noticeable at the moment.
[16:32] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[16:34] Frederic Lee: But then Google has introduced their AI overviews. So that's another thing that I use a lot.
[16:56] Melissa Wurzel: Can you guys hear me? Am I frozen?
[17:00] Chavilah Stowers: I can hear you, but it looks like
[17:02] Melissa Wurzel: Fred froze for me. It froze. Maybe he's back now. Back. I think you're back.
[17:09] Charlie Deist (1): Okay.
[17:10] Frederic Lee: Where'd I drop off?
[17:13] Melissa Wurzel: That's a good question.
[17:14] Melissa Wurzel: You were just saying about the blip and then you were talking about Google AI tools, I think. Okay.
[17:21] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Google introduced their AI overviews at the top of the search results.
[17:25] Frederic Lee: So plus a little bit of an effect from ChatGPT and those type of tools have caused websites, the end kind of user, to see a drop in traffic.
[17:38] Frederic Lee: A lot of that's top of funnel traffic, informational queries, things that often wouldn't drive conversion generally.
[17:47] Melissa Wurzel: So yeah. Okay, that's good to know.
[17:51] Frederic Lee: Sorry, my Internet's a little funky. Let me know if I cut out again.
[17:57] Frederic Lee: So for Google's parameter, it's really a tracking change.
[18:02] Frederic Lee: You'll see impressions are down, clicks are relatively maintaining. And then we may. I'm still.
[18:09] Frederic Lee: We're still trying to figure out what our SEO tools, our semrush and our Ahrefs are going to do about this.
[18:14] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[18:15] Frederic Lee: Right now they're, they're having trouble with anything that's ranking beyond page or page one or page two.
[18:23] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[18:26] Frederic Lee: So we'll just keeping looks weird and the ranking results, we'll put this asterisk next to it.
[18:31] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[18:32] Melissa Wurzel: So you're saying if I went into Google Analytics right now, I would probably see a drop in impressions?
[18:36] Melissa Wurzel: Last week? Starting last week, yeah.
[18:39] Frederic Lee: Google search Console will show you.
[18:40] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. Okay.
[18:45] Frederic Lee: So, yeah, sorry.
[18:46] Frederic Lee: It might have been a big explanation for minimal impacts, but just keeping you guys updated.
[18:50] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, it's good to know.
[18:56] Frederic Lee: Okay. Technical side, I know I dropped a message. I'm seeing.
[19:03] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee started sharing their screen
[19:07] Frederic Lee: I ran another crawl and my crawler got stuck again on the marketplace.
[19:13] Frederic Lee: Looks like we updated the marketplace pages.
[19:19] Melissa Wurzel: We. We don't have. We're. We're not in the marketplace. This would be our product team.
[19:23] Melissa Wurzel: And I have not connected with them on this yet because I remember you were talking about the number sequence at the bottom of the pages.
[19:29] Melissa Wurzel: And, like, it's getting stuck because there's no like, end. I think if I remember correctly.
[19:34] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, go on my list to talk to them about.
[19:37] Melissa Wurzel: Then when I saw you wanted to talk about it again, I'm like, all right, I'm just going to get all this information at once so I can start putting tickets in.
[19:44] Frederic Lee: Okay. It's funny. My crawler didn't get stuck on this. It went deeper into the marketplace.
[19:54] Frederic Lee: It looks like if you add another filter onto your results, it also is getting stuck.
[20:01] Melissa Wurzel: So.
[20:03] Frederic Lee: You got grade levels. You got grade levels.
[20:07] Frederic Lee: Category, multi course, semester event resource, full year plus curriculum. So it's.
[20:16] Frederic Lee: Yeah, it's really taking the fix that will work on this and applying it to all the categories on the page.
[20:25] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. So I should just be able to grab this language on this page and send it to them.
[20:30] Melissa Wurzel: And that would make sense to the engineering team, right?
[20:34] Frederic Lee: I'd hope so. I haven't had to really work through this with Engineer before.
[20:41] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[20:42] Frederic Lee: So I, I hope this makes sense to them.
[20:48] Melissa Wurzel: I'll go into our marketplace too, and just like go through this and see if it just makes sense before I send it over, but should be fine.
[20:57] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[20:58] Charlie Deist (1): Yeah.
[20:59] Frederic Lee: I have a few options up here on how to fix it.
[21:02] Frederic Lee: And then if they're not sure if they want to try one of these, I can recrawl and we can see if it works.
[21:09] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, sounds good.
[21:16] Frederic Lee: That was the main thing on the. On the tech side. Do you have anything on your end?
[21:22] Melissa Wurzel: So an Update on the 404s that you had pulled that had emojis in them that I could not figure out how to do the redirect.
[21:29] Melissa Wurzel: I figured it out. Those redirects are in there.
[21:34] Melissa Wurzel: I just used AI and it gave me the code for the stupid emoji, which was like, of course.
[21:38] Melissa Wurzel: Why didn't I just ask AI to begin with? That was probably. Anyway, those redirects should be in there.
[21:46] Melissa Wurzel: I'm thinking at this moment, in Time we shouldn't have any more 404s, but maybe we still have a couple.
[21:53] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know. So I just wanted to say that, like, I'm hoping those are pretty clean.
[21:54] Frederic Lee: Frederic Lee stopped sharing their screen
[21:59] Melissa Wurzel: One question I had for you, Fred, is like, as I've been in webflow on some of our main site pages that the market team owns, we'll get an alert in webflow and it says you're basically, like, your header structure isn't set up correctly.
[22:15] Melissa Wurzel: Like, you're either missing H2, like you went from H1 to H3 or whatever. Whatever.
[22:20] Melissa Wurzel: Like, it's not the way I think it's supposed to be.
[22:23] Melissa Wurzel: My question is, is that worth us taking the time to fix as well on some of the main pages?
[22:31] Melissa Wurzel: And I think the answer is yes.
[22:32] Melissa Wurzel: But I just kind of wanted to check on, like, does that impact crawlability?
[22:36] Melissa Wurzel: Like, what can we expect there in terms of trying to fix that, you know?
[22:40] Frederic Lee: Mm, yeah, that's. It depends on the page, really. If, you know, this is a page we want ranking.
[22:52] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[22:53] Frederic Lee: But yeah, we'll. We'll want an H1 present.
[22:57] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[22:57] Frederic Lee: On the page. It might be a styling thing that is. Is stopping that could be.
[23:04] Frederic Lee: Could be actually looking through. I'm seeing on like the marketplace some H1's missing.
[23:08] Frederic Lee: You say you're seeing it on.
[23:11] Melissa Wurzel: I'm seeing it on within, like the opened CO pages.
[23:14] Melissa Wurzel: I didn't, I didn't write down exactly which page it was.
[23:17] Melissa Wurzel: I've seen it a couple times when I've gone in there, like havala.
[23:21] Melissa Wurzel: I think when you're in webflow, I forget which page I.
[23:24] Melissa Wurzel: I think I was in there adding Nevada to our states, which would be on the home page.
[23:30] Melissa Wurzel: And I noticed in the left hand column when you go into like the settings or whatever, it just said, like, it has like a audit thing that comes up and it says you're missing an H2 or something on this page.
[23:45] Melissa Wurzel: So it may just be worth doing a scan on our main site pages, like, especially the ones that are getting the most traffic and probably the Landers, I would imagine.
[23:54] Melissa Wurzel: We just want to make sure we have the structure set up right.
[23:58] Melissa Wurzel: And I didn't grab any details about this.
[24:01] Melissa Wurzel: Like, I don't remember if it was an H2 or an H3 or what it was, but I was talking to Ella about it earlier today.
[24:07] Melissa Wurzel: It was like, this may go on your audit list to just sort of fix, but we may want to do a sweep and just see how big the problem is and what pages it's on, and then we can determine what makes sense to prioritize.
[24:26] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Let me. Let me take a look at the core pages to see what's.
[24:31] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[24:33] Frederic Lee: What it looks like. Yeah. 2. I feel like I might have this somewhere.
[24:41] Frederic Lee: Do you have a list of the state landers?
[24:45] Melissa Wurzel: Yes, yes. I can send it to you. Like, just off the top of my head.
[24:50] Melissa Wurzel: Like, Oregon and Utah would be big ones. So it's just opened co Utah, forward slash Oregon. Yeah.
[24:57] Melissa Wurzel: But, yeah, I can send you a list of those landers, but I want to say it wasn't.
[25:06] Melissa Wurzel: I did not go in and look at the landers for this problem, but I noticed it, I think, when I was adding the new state to the homepage Havala.
[25:14] Melissa Wurzel: So it might be one of the main pages, like Contact Us or how it works or, you know, the homepage itself.
[25:21] Melissa Wurzel: There was just like a little thing in the left hand column that said alert with a red dot.
[25:28] Chavilah Stowers: Yeah, I have to keep an eye out for that. I don't know if I've seen it,
[25:31] Melissa Wurzel: but I'm
[25:31] Chavilah Stowers: okay as I'm going through
[25:33] Melissa Wurzel: all of them.
[25:34] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, I'll try and send you a picture of it if I see it so you'll know where to look for it.
[25:39] Melissa Wurzel: Because I don't feel like I had seen it before and then I saw it.
[25:43] Melissa Wurzel: I'm like, what is this and how many pages is it.
[25:52] Frederic Lee: For those state landers? I know they're. They're serving kind of both paid and.
[26:04] Melissa Wurzel: SEO.
[26:09] Frederic Lee: But they're a little tough to find on the site unless you have the link.
[26:14] Melissa Wurzel: We do not have them linked on the site intentionally, I think.
[26:22] Melissa Wurzel: So they're just standalone landers by state. Because they're like basically the same information.
[26:28] Melissa Wurzel: Not entirely, but basically.
[26:31] Melissa Wurzel: And you're right, they're being used for paid, and I think they're probably ranking organic. I don't.
[26:36] Melissa Wurzel: Whatever in the local markets. And I thought about this so much, Fred.
[26:41] Melissa Wurzel: I'm like, do we do a separate page? It's so crazy.
[26:45] Melissa Wurzel: Like, because our product is essentially free money that we're giving families. Like, they just.
[26:56] Melissa Wurzel: They convert. Like, we don't need like some crazy sophisticated paid lander.
[27:02] Melissa Wurzel: It doesn't matter how many questions we add to our form. It just blows me away.
[27:06] Melissa Wurzel: Like, we'll go in and we'll be like, okay, well, we want to get their zip code if they're in Oregon.
[27:10] Melissa Wurzel: And I'm like, oh, okay. We'll probably see a drop off in conversion. It's like, no, people.
[27:13] Melissa Wurzel: Like, it's not like it's not. We're not asking them to make a purchase. You know, we're basically.
[27:19] Melissa Wurzel: They hear about us and they're like, great, I could get access to funding. I'm all in. Like, it.
[27:24] Melissa Wurzel: It doesn't see. And I've thought about it. I was like, should we build separate instances of these?
[27:28] Melissa Wurzel: And I'm like, I don't think it makes sense.
[27:31] Melissa Wurzel: I just think simple is better right now because people are converting.
[27:37] Melissa Wurzel: It doesn't mean we might not want to change the structure at some point of the Landers.
[27:43] Frederic Lee: But.
[27:45] Melissa Wurzel: I don't know, it just continues to blow me away. I'm like, okay, yeah.
[27:51] Melissa Wurzel: You know, like, really with a paid lander, you wouldn't want any of those links on the top.
[27:55] Melissa Wurzel: Like, you just be super, you know, streamlined with getting them to convert.
[27:58] Melissa Wurzel: And it's like, I don't know.
[28:01] Frederic Lee: Yeah, I hear you. I mean, if it's working, it's working.
[28:06] Melissa Wurzel: For sure.
[28:09] Frederic Lee: I was just looking at the rankings because I know I mentioned this before, if you Google like homeschool programs or anything like that, the Google does localize your results to your state.
[28:24] Melissa Wurzel: Right.
[28:26] Frederic Lee: And because we're not, from what I'm seeing, and maybe I'm missing it, we're not linking to these state landers from our navigation or from our homepage.
[28:36] Frederic Lee: We're deprioritizing these for Google important pages. I see there's an audience thing there.
[28:47] Frederic Lee: It would be valuable to get these linked to and proven to Google that these are important pages on our site for the organic rankings in the states.
[28:58] Melissa Wurzel: That's great to know. So in your mind, where would those links have to to be?
[29:04] Melissa Wurzel: Would they need to be like in a navigation or just any, like anywhere?
[29:10] Frederic Lee: Best case scenario, if we. If we really want these to go, would be in the navigation.
[29:16] Frederic Lee: Can be a drop down in the navigation and then on the homepage.
[29:22] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[29:23] Frederic Lee: If that's gonna, you know, mess things up from an audience, we can kind of step back from there.
[29:28] Frederic Lee: But that would be best case scenario.
[29:32] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, I'm gonna give some thought to that.
[29:33] Melissa Wurzel: That's a great point because I've actually been sitting here going, because we just turned our Facebook ads on.
[29:39] Melissa Wurzel: And I'm going, do we really want to?
[29:40] Melissa Wurzel: Maybe we won't turn Google on for like the next couple months because we're just crazy growth, like just killing goals.
[29:48] Melissa Wurzel: So I'm like, maybe we won't turn Google paid on.
[29:51] Melissa Wurzel: But then I'm sitting here going, if those pages are ranking organically anyway in those states.
[29:56] Melissa Wurzel: But to your point, like really to get those moved up in priority, we should link those to the main site and we may get like a boost there, so.
[30:05] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, that's great. That's, that's, that's a great.
[30:08] Frederic Lee: Yeah. Pages like that are a worse scenario than, than that where they're considered orphan pages.
[30:16] Frederic Lee: They have no linking to them. They're kind of out there by theirself.
[30:21] Frederic Lee: That's one thing we avoid for SEO rankings.
[30:24] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[30:26] Frederic Lee: Yeah, that sounds great.
[30:31] Melissa Wurzel: And then I don't.
[30:33] Melissa Wurzel: I still think I have a list of pages somewhere that still have more of the HTTPs stuff that you gave, like changing the HTTP to the HTTPs link or whatever it is.
[30:47] Melissa Wurzel: I think there's still more of those that need to be done.
[30:51] Melissa Wurzel: I'm just kind of doing that stuff as I have like five or ten minutes between meetings and Pavila is doing some of it and we're just kind of knocking it out.
[30:59] Melissa Wurzel: So hopefully those will continue to improve.
[31:02] Frederic Lee: Okay, great.
[31:10] Melissa Wurzel: Was there anything else in terms of technical stuff that you saw that was new, that you're like, oh, this is a new major problem besides the marketplace, though?
[31:22] Frederic Lee: No, no, I'm just looking through this list. There's a couple smaller things, but.
[31:30] Melissa Wurzel: The.
[31:31] Frederic Lee: Site seems to be in a, in a decent spot. Yeah, yeah. Nothing major that stands out to me.
[31:43] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[31:45] Frederic Lee: I do have a note here on, on H ones missing, so I'll definitely take a look at those.
[31:52] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. That may be what I saw in Webflow because like the H1s are the most important, right?
[32:02] Melissa Wurzel: Like in terms of callability and ranking and all that stuff. Like we need to have those set up. Right?
[32:09] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[32:11] Frederic Lee: And I noticed on the home page, I was just looking quickly there, there are multiple H1s.
[32:16] Frederic Lee: That might be one thing that's being flagged, but. Yeah, let me take a look.
[32:23] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[32:33] Frederic Lee: One thing we spoke about, I think it was in our last meeting, Charlie, was the tools section and two parts of this first one, unless I'm.
[32:49] Frederic Lee: I missed it, are the tools.
[32:54] Melissa Wurzel: Are.
[32:54] Frederic Lee: They linked to like in our navigation?
[32:56] Charlie Deist (1): No, no, they're not. Well, I think it was just not really. I think it's. It's ready to launch.
[33:07] Charlie Deist (1): It might not be what we all want, right live, but it's not linked to.
[33:19] Frederic Lee: Got it.
[33:20] Melissa Wurzel: What's still open ended on it, Charlie, like, what are you worried about?
[33:25] Charlie Deist (1): Nothing, I just didn't really. I've never planned kind of like how I was going to announce it.
[33:30] Charlie Deist (1): There also might be a couple of religious curricula that are not reimbursable.
[33:37] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. Just wondering if we don't add it. Add it under the resources drop down and, like, not do a.
[33:48] Melissa Wurzel: Maybe we don't make a big deal out of it, you know?
[33:50] Charlie Deist (1): Yeah, right.
[33:53] Melissa Wurzel: No, that seems.
[33:56] Charlie Deist (1): That seems fine. I can add that to my top five for this week because I think the cleanup.
[34:02] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[34:02] Charlie Deist (1): It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
[34:06] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[34:08] Frederic Lee: The 1. Is my connection bad?
[34:13] Melissa Wurzel: No, you're good. Okay.
[34:14] Charlie Deist (1): No, it's good.
[34:16] Frederic Lee: The one note I had on those is right now, the tool pages.
[34:22] Melissa Wurzel: The.
[34:22] Frederic Lee: Title tag is just open edge for every tool page.
[34:28] Frederic Lee: So if you get the name of the tool and the title tag before launch, that will at least, you know, allow them to be kind of separate.
[34:37] Frederic Lee: Separate pages optimized for their tool name.
[34:40] Melissa Wurzel: Is that in the cms, Charlie? In Webflow? Hmm.
[34:46] Charlie Deist (1): I don't think so. I.
[34:50] Charlie Deist (1): Because I'm guessing that the, like, it's a collection type collection, and the name of each tool should be the name of the tool there.
[35:00] Charlie Deist (1): But I don't know where you access those title tags. Let me look in the webflow.
[35:06] Melissa Wurzel: Let me just look real quick, see if I can find it.
[35:10] Melissa Wurzel: Heck, maybe I'll see the little alert thing I was talking about. Oh, yeah, tools.
[35:17] Melissa Wurzel: Let me see if I can share this with you guys.
[35:27] Melissa Wurzel: Melissa Wurzel started sharing their screen
[35:30] Melissa Wurzel: You see, so this is in the cms, Charlie, and I'm assuming this. This tools.
[35:34] Melissa Wurzel: And tool tags over here are. This is your tools, right? Your pages within that section. Let me see.
[35:44] Melissa Wurzel: Because if you click on one, this is where you see the slug. And the title tag is normally.
[35:57] Melissa Wurzel: Normally up here.
[36:09] Melissa Wurzel: Interesting.
[36:11] Charlie Deist: Charlie Deist joined
[36:11] Charlie Deist: Charlie Deist left
[36:21] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah.
[36:22] Charlie Deist (2): Let's see. So where.
[36:24] Melissa Wurzel: I don't see a title tag here.
[36:26] Charlie Deist (2): I.
[36:27] Melissa Wurzel: No, no, I don't see them. And. And let me just compare, like, you go to your posts, you click here.
[36:34] Melissa Wurzel: I can go down here. Oh, this is where the meta description is.
[36:39] Melissa Wurzel: Maybe that's what I've been changing and not the title tag itself. Well, that's this, right?
[36:47] Melissa Wurzel: Is that the title tag or is that the title of the post?
[36:54] Frederic Lee: Those can be separate things.
[36:56] Frederic Lee: Or a lot of times the CMS may automatically take your title to make it your title tag.
[37:05] Melissa Wurzel: I bet that's the case. So that means. Well, that means this would be like.
[37:11] Frederic Lee: That says name instead of title, which is interesting.
[37:16] Melissa Wurzel: This is the. Did Demand Flow build this, Charlie, or did they have nothing to do with this?
[37:27] Charlie Deist (2): They. They built this.
[37:29] Melissa Wurzel: Okay. We may need to ask them where we locate the title.
[37:36] Charlie Deist (2): Right? I mean, do we know where the title tags are for the regular blog
[37:39] Charlie Deist (1): posts?
[37:39] Melissa Wurzel: Yes, if you go to. Well, I feel Like, I've changed these. This is weird.
[38:02] Melissa Wurzel: I wonder if I went in some other part of webflow when I did this.
[38:17] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, I'm not really seeing a title tag. Interesting.
[38:24] Melissa Wurzel: I mean, when you go to the main site and you go to home and you click on this, this is where this comes up and pulls your title tag and your meta description.
[38:42] Melissa Wurzel: This is where I've been updating this stuff in these pages.
[38:47] Melissa Wurzel: And while I'm in here, I'll just see if I can show you that little audit alert that I got.
[38:52] Melissa Wurzel: Maybe it's going now.
[38:58] Melissa Wurzel: I think it's just clicking on this button and then it gives you the issues that are on each page.
[39:02] Melissa Wurzel: But I'm not sure. I can't remember. But, yeah, that's. That's where it is for the main pages.
[39:17] Melissa Wurzel: So I think the CMS is, like, doing something weird.
[39:33] Melissa Wurzel: All right.
[39:34] Melissa Wurzel: You know that other way you were getting into your pages, Charlie? That was like the old way. Yeah.
[39:39] Frederic Lee: I don't remember how to do that.
[39:40] Melissa Wurzel: Right this second, but I wonder if there's a way to get in that way at it.
[39:44] Charlie Deist (2): Yeah, And I'm just looking. In Chat gbt, it talks about editing the collection template
[39:48] Charlie Deist (1): page
[39:49] Charlie Deist (2): under
[39:49] Charlie Deist (1): Pages.
[39:50] Charlie Deist (2): CMS Collection Pages Update, SEO settings. Click the gear icon. Scroll to SEO Settings.
[39:57] Charlie Deist (2): In the title tag field, you can type static text or insert dynamic fields from your collection using the add field button.
[40:04] Charlie Deist (2): For example, name and then site name. So it should be. And can you get like. Yeah.
[40:11] Charlie Deist (2): Can you click that settings button in the top right there? Next, a new
[40:15] Charlie Deist (1): tool
[40:16] Charlie Deist (2): S for me. I can't click
[40:18] Charlie Deist (1): that one, but
[40:20] Charlie Deist (2): now it's there. So let's see. Scroll down maybe. Let's see. Collection settings.
[40:29] Charlie Deist (2): Collection name, Collection URL Tool settings.
[40:34] Frederic Lee: Okay.
[40:35] Charlie Deist (2): Click the template page for your collection.
[40:40] Melissa Wurzel: Yes.
[40:40] Melissa Wurzel: I feel like I remember when there was that issue with the way Open Ed was capitalized that Isaac found, and it was on a post, like, article.
[40:49] Melissa Wurzel: I went into the template and found that it was wrong in the template and changed it there, and then it made the change on the pages.
[40:57] Melissa Wurzel: So I can't remember.
[40:59] Melissa Wurzel: This literally took me, like 20 minutes to find one morning because I was like, I.
[41:04] Melissa Wurzel: I can't remember where the template is, but I did find it.
[41:08] Charlie Deist (2): We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. I think. Yeah. I don't know why the.
[41:14] Charlie Deist (2): The Ella Richmond login doesn't give me access to those settings, but I could use the other login and poke around a little bit or.
[41:22] Charlie Deist (2): If you want to do that, feel free.
[41:25] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. See what I can find.
[41:28] Frederic Lee: Maybe it's like adding a new collection field midway down there, that blue button.
[41:33] Melissa Wurzel: If I remember correctly, the way you had it set up in whatever template page I found, Charlie, it was like always make the title tag.
[41:43] Melissa Wurzel: You had it set up. It was like the name of whatever it is you have the slash and then you had opened.
[41:49] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, it was like a template thing that made sense.
[41:53] Melissa Wurzel: We just need to find out where that is and see how the tools thing hooks into it.
[42:02] Frederic Lee: That'd be best instead of having to manually do it.
[42:03] Melissa Wurzel: Melissa Wurzel stopped sharing their screen
[42:07] Charlie Deist (1): The template.
[42:08] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, cool.
[42:13] Frederic Lee: Yeah, so that'll. Google's already pulling some of these tools and giving them their own title tag.
[42:20] Frederic Lee: Google's trying to do it for us.
[42:21] Frederic Lee: So if we get all these tools linked to from the homepage title tag for their name, we'll at least like, have it all there.
[42:31] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[42:31] Frederic Lee: Google to crawl a lot of these. I know we talked about this.
[42:36] Frederic Lee: It's very competitive trying to outrank a tool for its own tool name.
[42:43] Melissa Wurzel: Yep.
[42:44] Frederic Lee: But these are good because they kind of provide some type of a review for them.
[42:50] Frederic Lee: So there might be like a phase two of these tool pages after we get them going as to like, how do we want to tweak them?
[42:56] Frederic Lee: We really want to be like a thought leader in like reviewing of these tools as the company.
[43:02] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[43:03] Frederic Lee: Which is good for LLMs and stuff.
[43:07] Frederic Lee: When people search for like, best math tools, they will crawl and find sites that review the tools as well.
[43:16] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[43:18] Frederic Lee: But yeah, phase one, I think we get the title tags update, get them linked to get them fully live, see how they kind of work, react in rankings.
[43:34] Melissa Wurzel: Okay.
[43:35] Frederic Lee: One other thing is keyword research training.
[43:39] Frederic Lee: I'm building a doc and I wanted to walk through it with whoever wants to be on it and kind of walk through the kind of the thought process behind how we approach keywords and intent and then what it looks like to.
[43:53] Frederic Lee: To kind of check those and research them in some rush.
[43:58] Frederic Lee: So yeah, I was wondering if later this week or early next week there's a time that we could run through that.
[44:04] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah, for sure.
[44:05] Melissa Wurzel: So I definitely want Ella to be part of this, and I know she wants to be part of this.
[44:09] Melissa Wurzel: And she'll be in Kansas all week. So how about like next week? I mean, like, how about next Wednesday?
[44:17] Melissa Wurzel: Does that work for you? Like, I don't know if that works for you guys.
[44:20] Charlie Deist (1): Have a lot.
[44:21] Melissa Wurzel: Charlie, does that work for you?
[44:24] Charlie Deist (2): Yeah, that works.
[44:27] Frederic Lee: Same time?
[44:28] Melissa Wurzel: Yeah. Okay, cool.
[44:31] Frederic Lee: I'll throw it on the. On the calendar for us.
[44:34] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, cool. Yeah, I know, we're looking forward to looking at that and learning more.
[44:41] Frederic Lee: Okay, great. Those are the main things I had on my end today.
[44:47] Melissa Wurzel: Okay, cool. We'll do some digging on some of this other stuff.
[44:50] Melissa Wurzel: And I'm going to give some thought to those landers because that's a really, really, really good point.
[44:56] Melissa Wurzel: So we'll circle back. Okay, great.
[44:58] Frederic Lee: Appreciate it.
[44:59] Charlie Deist (1): Have a great week.
[45:00] Melissa Wurzel: All right. Thanks, Fred. Appreciate it. Bye. Bye.
