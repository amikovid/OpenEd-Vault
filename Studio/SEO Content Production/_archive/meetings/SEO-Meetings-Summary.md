## Key Decisions Made

1. **Tools vs Marketplace** - Keep separate (different funnel stages)
2. **Tools page template** - Merge sections, remove toggle, add author bylines
3. **Testimonials** - Curated over open reviews (moderation concerns)
4. **Grade content** - Can be similar across adjacent grades (2nd/3rd, 6th/7th)
5. **State outlines** - Fred to provide 2 examples (structure varies by state)
6. **Pricing on tools pages** - Link to marketplace instead of maintaining duplicate info
