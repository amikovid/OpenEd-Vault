## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Khan Academy really free?**

Yes, 100% free. Khan Academy is a nonprofit founded on the principle that quality education should be accessible to everyone. There are no hidden costs or premium tiers for the core content.

**Is IXL worth the money?**

For many families, yes - especially if your child needs extensive practice. IXL's adaptive system and detailed progress tracking justify the cost for students who benefit from drill. For OpenEd families, it's free in the marketplace.

**Can I use Khan Academy as a full math curriculum?**

Khan Academy can serve as a primary math resource, but it works better as a teaching tool than a complete curriculum. Many families pair it with a structured curriculum and use Khan for instruction when concepts need explanation.

**Which is better for struggling math students?**

Both can help, but in different ways. Khan Academy's video instruction helps students who need concepts explained. IXL's adaptive practice helps students who understand but need more repetition to build fluency.

**Do colleges accept Khan Academy?**

Khan Academy itself isn't a curriculum that appears on transcripts, but the SAT prep is widely respected. Many homeschool families use Khan alongside accredited programs.

## Article 3: Saxon Math vs Math-U-See

**Status:** ✅ Quality loop passed - needs FAQ section added

### Meta Elements
- **Title:** Saxon Math vs Math-U-See: Which Is Right for Your Family? (2026)
- **Meta Description:** Saxon Math or Math-U-See? We break down the real differences - spiral vs mastery, drill vs manipulatives - to help you choose the right math curriculum.

- **Primary Keyword:** math u see vs saxon (140/mo)

### FAQ Section to Add (before Related Comparisons)

```markdown

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Saxon Math too repetitive?**

For some students, yes. Saxon's spiral approach means constant review, which builds fluency but can bore kids who master concepts quickly. If your child gets frustrated doing the same types of problems repeatedly, Saxon may not be the best fit.

**Is Math-U-See good for kids who hate math?**

Often yes. The manipulative blocks make abstract concepts concrete, which helps many struggling students. Steve Demme's calm video teaching style also reduces math anxiety. Many families switch to Math-U-See specifically because their child was frustrated with other programs.

**Can you switch from Saxon to Math-U-See mid-year?**

Yes, but use Math-U-See's placement test first. The programs cover concepts in different orders, so your child may need to start at a different level than expected. Most families find the transition smooth if they place correctly.

**Which is better for gifted math students?**

Saxon's consistent challenge and lack of hand-holding works well for self-motivated students. However, gifted students may find the repetition tedious. Math-U-See's mastery approach lets students move faster through concepts they understand quickly.

**Do you need the Math-U-See blocks?**

For younger students (through Zeta/6th grade), the blocks are central to the method and highly recommended. For Pre-Algebra and above, the blocks become optional as students transition to abstract thinking.

## Article 4: IXL vs Exact Path

**Status:** ✅ Quality loop passed - needs FAQ section added

### Meta Elements
- **Title:** IXL vs Exact Path: What OpenEd Teachers Actually Recommend
- **Meta Description:** Our teachers work with both daily. Here's when to use IXL, when to use Exact Path - and why most families should use both.
- **URL:** `/compare/ixl-vs-exact-path`
- **Primary Keyword:** ixl vs exact path

### FAQ Section to Add (before Related section)

```markdown

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Exact Path better than IXL?**

Neither is better overall - they serve different purposes. Exact Path excels at diagnosing gaps and teaching concepts. IXL excels at drilling specific skills. Most OpenEd families use both.

**How long does the Exact Path diagnostic take?**

About 45 minutes per subject. It's thorough, which is why the personalized learning path is so accurate. Plan for a focused session without interruptions.

**Can IXL replace a math curriculum?**

No. IXL is practice, not instruction. It assumes concepts have been taught elsewhere. Use it alongside a curriculum or teaching tool like Khan Academy, not as a standalone program.

**Is Exact Path free?**

For OpenEd families, yes - it's included in the student library. Outside of OpenEd, it's a paid product typically sold to schools.

**Which should I start with?**

Start with Exact Path if you're unsure where your child's gaps are. The diagnostic will identify problem areas, then you can use IXL to drill those specific skills.

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Not in the traditional sense. Reggio Emilia is a philosophy and approach to early childhood education, not a prescribed curriculum.
