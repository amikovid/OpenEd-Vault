## Production Process

Used the `quality-loop` skill for all profiles. Process:

1. **Sources** - Compile from OpenEd content + web research
2. **Hook** - Propose 4-6 options, user selects
3. **Draft** - Write full article
4. **Judges** - Run through 5 quality gates
5. **Iterate** - Fix any failures, re-run judge

See `.claude/skills/quality-loop/skill.md` for full process documentation.

## Key Decisions

### Structural Differentiation
Each profile uses a different structural hook to avoid sameness:
- **Gatto:** Institutional critique (7 lessons framework)
- **Illich:** Philosophical/radical vision (abolish schools)
- **Gray:** Scientific/research angle (evolutionary psychology)
- **Montessori:** Personal drama narrative (secret son, exile)
- **Greenberg:** Evidence/longevity angle (55 years of proof)
- **Holt:** Evolution story (good student → revolutionary)

### Internal Linking
All profiles link to each other where relevant, creating a content cluster. Each also links to related guides (unschooling, microschools, etc.).

### Source Priority
When no direct podcast coverage exists, expand search to related themes rather than just exact names. Example: For Greenberg, searched "democratic education", "self-directed", "trust children".

## Learnings (Codified in quality-loop skill)

### AI Patterns to Avoid
1. **Correlative constructions:** "X isn't just Y - it's Z"
2. **Dramatic contrast reveals:** "Not on lessons. On fear."
3. **Split-sentence correlatives:** "X didn't emerge from Y. It came from Z."
4. **Staccato patterns:** "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
5. **Triple adjective stacks:** "Bold, beautiful, brilliant"

### What Works
- Start with specific moment/paradox, not definitions
- Use subject's own words when possible
- Include practical takeaways for parents
- Connect to living thinkers (Gray) and existing content

## Remaining Work

### Hub Page
Now unblocked with 6 profiles. Options:
1. Timeline format (chronological)
2. Card grid (visual overview)
3. Thematic grouping

## Future Directions

The initial 6 profiles lean toward the deschooling/unschooling end of alternative education. Future profiles should expand to other pivotal figures across the spectrum.

### Candidates

**Classical/Traditional Alternative:**
- **Charlotte Mason** - "Living books," nature study, habit formation. Huge homeschool following. Different philosophy than unschooling but equally influential.
- **Dorothy Sayers** - "Lost Tools of Learning" essay. Classical education revival.

**Modern Disruptors:**
- **Sal Khan** - Khan Academy founder. Mastery-based learning, "flipping the classroom." Tech-enabled but philosophically aligned with self-paced learning.
- **Sugata Mitra** - "Hole in the Wall" experiments. Self-organized learning environments.

**Developmental/Philosophical:**
- **Rudolf Steiner** - Waldorf education founder. Developmental stages, arts integration.
- **Jean Piaget** - Developmental psychology. Not an educator per se but foundational to child-led approaches.
- **Lev Vygotsky** - Zone of proximal development. Social learning theory.

**Progressive Era:**
- **John Dewey** - Progressive education. Learning by doing. Complex legacy.
- **Francis Parker** - "Father of progressive education" (before Dewey).

**Contemporary Voices:**
- **Ken Robinson** - "Do Schools Kill Creativity?" Most-watched TED talk. Died 2020.
- **Alfie Kohn** - Critique of grades, homework, rewards. Prolific author.
- **Carol Dweck** - Growth mindset research.

### Selection Criteria for Future Profiles
1. Search volume / SEO opportunity
2. OpenEd proprietary content (podcast guests, newsletter coverage)
3. Relevance to OpenEd families (practical application)
4. Structural differentiation (avoid another "radical critic" angle)
5. Balance across philosophical spectrum

### Notes
- Charlotte Mason and Sal Khan are high priority - large audiences, underserved by current profiles
- Ken Robinson would tie to existing "creativity" content
- Classical education figures (Mason, Sayers) appeal to different audience segment than deschooling profiles
