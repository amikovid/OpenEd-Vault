## Key Concepts

### Scientific Observation Method
- Approached education as a physician, not a theorist
- Observed how children actually learn vs. theorizing how they should
- Documented, tested, refined based on evidence

### The "Unteachable" Children
- First worked with intellectually disabled children in asylums
- Methods proved so effective that disabled children passed standard exams
- Realized: if it works for disabled children, what about "normal" children?
- Casa dei Bambini proved the method worked universally

### Core Principles
- "The child is the teacher" - adults observe, prepare environment, step back
- Children have "absorbent minds" - especially ages 0-6
- Learning through concrete materials before abstract concepts
- Self-correction built into materials
- Mixed-age groupings
- "Prepared environment" over direct instruction

### Famous Quote
"The greatest sign of success for a teacher is to be able to say, 'The children are now working as if I did not exist.'"

## The "Montessori Mafia"

Wall Street Journal term for successful Montessori alumni:

- **Jeff Bezos** - Amazon founder
- **Jimmy Wales** - Wikipedia founder

"We both went to Montessori school, and I think it was part of that training of not following rules and orders, and being self-motivated, questioning what's going on in the world, doing things a little bit differently."
