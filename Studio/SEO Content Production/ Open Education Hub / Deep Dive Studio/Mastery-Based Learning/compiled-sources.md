## THEME 1: CORE PHILOSOPHY - What Is Mastery Learning?

### Quote 1
**Quote:** "When did you first come across the concept of competency-based education or 'mastered and not yet'? ... It goes back to my teacher preparation program. When I first started teaching in the 90s, I'd been trained to build rubrics - this idea of transparency where you have a clear rubric showing exactly what your project will be judged on. Project-based learning was big then. That naturally transitioned to competency-based education, where those rubrics let you know ahead of time exactly what you'll be judged on. Students would self-evaluate on the rubric, get a peer to judge it, and then an outside adult. You had all this feedback and could see if you'd mastered it or had some 'not yets.'"

### Quote 2
**Quote:** "What bugs me is when we impose on kids that they're failures, or that they're not proficient enough, or they just aren't good enough. You have to say, 'not yet.' They're not there yet. And that three-letter word of 'yet' adds so much strength to a kid, to a person who's struggling, because they know that they still have runway."

### Quote 4
**Quote:** "Competency-based education focuses on students demonstrating mastery of skills and knowledge at their own pace, rather than being confined to a rigid, time-based system. It offers: 1. Individualized, flexible pacing 2. Educational transparency 3. A 'mastered' or 'not yet' grading model that fosters a love for lifelong learning"

### Quote 6
**Quote:** "Ask yourself this question as a human being: 'Have you already mastered everything there is to do on earth?' Of course not! So, let's all admit that even as adults we all have a bunch of 'not-yets' in so many aspects of our lives. Yes, while we have each mastered some things, we are all still working, growing, and developing our own talents as we speak. I know I'm a 'not-yet' in many ways. And that's totally okay."

## THEME 2: THE PROBLEM - Why Traditional Grading Fails

### Quote 8
**Quote:** "LeBron James is a failure. Now it says after that, 'at least he would be if he were graded like we grade our kids.' ... I love that chapter opening because it really gets at what we were just talking about. LeBron James is a failure if we apply this rubric to him, to any basketball player, to any athlete. You mean you make 50% of the shots that you take? That's it? On a grading scale? We're talking F, right?"

**Speaker:** Isaac Morehouse, CEO of OpenEd

---

### Quote 10
**Quote:** "How about Simone Biles, the undisputed greatest gymnast ever? She has 'only' won an Olympic medal in 61% of the events where she competed. Should we give her career a grade of D-? And if we used a 'gold' standard, her score would only be 39%, which would be a failing grade in school."

---

### Quote 14
**Quote:** "And let's start the clock, and it's going to expire at 11:02. And if you don't have it turned in by then, you don't get anything. It's the stress of the timer, the lack of transparency. We don't even let kids or teachers know what's going to be on the test. We say it aligns to these ambiguous standards, but in the sake of protecting the authenticity of the test, we don't tell anyone what's on it."

**Speaker:** Matt Bowman, Co-founder and CEO of OpenEd

**Suggested Use:** The Problem - specific critique of testing practices

---

### Quote 15
**Quote:** "That's the opposite of transparency. Teachers need to know, parents need to know, students need to know. And then we do 'gotchas,' we do timed tests, we say 'don't talk to anyone.' Where else in business would you say, 'Don't talk to experts to get your answers'? That's the most ridiculous thing. 'Do not email anybody. Do not have a Zoom call. Do not talk to anyone who knows what you're looking for.' That's the opposite of what we want people to learn."

**Suggested Use:** The Problem - the absurdity of "no collaboration" rules

---

### Quote 16
**Quote:** "When you imagine hiring for a business and the only way you hire is sending out a multiple choice test and whoever did the best on it gets brought onto the team - no one would do that. ... We all know that's how most of us hire, but somehow in education it's just: number grade, number grade, number grade."

**Context:** The hidden curriculum of schooling
**Suggested Use:** The Problem - what students actually learn from traditional systems

---

### Quote 18
**Quote:** "For example, you have to appease authority and please authority to be considered successful. You have to do things in the correct order and pass the test to have learned something. The measure of your success has nothing to do with what you can do in the real world; it has everything to do with how you're able to score on some standardized measure of your learning."

**Context:** Listing the implicit lessons that grades teach
**Suggested Use:** The Problem - the hidden messages of grading

---

### Quote 19
**Quote:** "One of the reasons standardized education doesn't work for the 10 to 14 year old is because these two kids are absolutely normal: one is 6'4" inches and one is 4'6" inches. They're statistically normal, but yet there's such a range. There are kids that are driving cars when other kids are still playing with cars. Same with dating and playing with dolls. They're all totally developmentally normal. How do you set a standardized system for that range of developmental differences? You just can't."

**Speaker:** Matt Bowman, Co-founder and CEO of OpenEd
**Source:** `/Users/charliedeist/Desktop/New Root Docs/OpenEd Vault/Published Content/Podcasts/Episode 001 - Students Arent Standard.md`
**Context:** The impossibility of standardizing during rapid developmental change
**Suggested Use:** The Problem - why one-size-fits-all fails

---

### Quote 20
**Quote:** "One size fits all never made sense. It was never the right way to educate kids or serve families. It worked for a number of decades because the expectations were such that it sort of stayed in line, but it wasn't really the way to optimize learning or development or opportunity."

---

### Quote 27
**Quote:** "The shift happens around third grade. Before that, kids are 'learning to read' - decoding words, building fluency, making the connection between sounds and symbols. After third grade, they're 'reading to learn' - using reading as a tool to absorb everything else. History. Science. Math word problems. Instructions."

Well, then all of a sudden he wanted to go to school. ... So that summer, he literally started Khan Academy as a 13-year-old. He was like, 'I'll just start at kindergarten,' and he just went through the entire Khan Academy until he caught up to like algebra or whatever they were at. He did it in like a month or two just by himself."

### Quote 43
**Quote:** "If a kid is spending 45 minutes to an hour in a classroom, they have almost no time to do actual focused work. So much time spent inside of a class is wasted space.

**Suggested Use:** Practical Implementation - the inefficiency problem

---

### Quote 44
**Quote:** "You're also working at the pace of the averaged pace of an entire class instead of the individual pace at which you learn, which is almost universally not the optimal pace. It's not the right pace for any kid. It's sort of this weird amalgamated average, this sort of invisible student that doesn't actually exist."

### Quote 45
**Quote:** "Implementing competency-based education doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. There are ways to incorporate elements of this approach within both traditional and non-traditional school settings: 1. Offer mastery-based grading on specific assignments or projects 2. Provide predefined rubrics to ensure educational transparency 3. Allow for flexible pacing to accommodate students' individual needs"

We'll start you on a book for all 40-year-olds. All 40-year-olds start at this level of piano because they should already know this.' It's insane, right? But we assume that about all these subjects during school."

## THEME 6: OBJECTION HANDLING

### Quote 48
**Quote:** "People hear that kind of story and they think, 'Okay, my kid will have made it when they all of a sudden click, and they're able to learn multiple grade levels over the course of one year.' And that's not the point here. ... Your child shouldn't be aspiring to learn way faster than kids in the classroom if it doesn't align with their goals. If there's no reason why they're intrinsically motivated to do so, or for whatever reason they're not ready yet."

**Context:** Addressing the "speed is the goal" misconception
**Suggested Use:** Objection Handling - "So the goal is to go faster?"

---

### Quote 49
**Quote:** "The goal isn't to crack the code somehow so they suddenly can learn way faster. The point is that it is possible and it routinely happens when a child is motivated correctly and incentivized for the right reasons to do something. ... But it shouldn't be the thing that you're trying to push your kid into doing. There's nothing inherently virtuous about learning two grades of math in a year as opposed to one."

### Quote 50
**Quote:** "When they have the freedom to learn things very fast, and also not to learn things very fast if that's what's aligned with their goals, that's the thing that indicates that you're on the right path. Not that your child is learning faster than average - you're still playing the school game, which is 'Here are the metrics. My kid is scoring higher than yours.' You're still thinking in a schooled mindset."

### Quote 51
**Quote:** "It's not that we should protect kids and never make them do anything hard. In later chapters, we talk about how one of the most rewarding things is accomplishing something challenging. The point of saying 'fish don't climb trees' isn't that we don't want kids to be challenged. The point is that there are challenging things for each child to discover."

### Quote 52
**Quote:** "I love that Einstein quote because there's one reaction to it which is: 'Okay, we need to shield kids from the knowledge that they're not good at certain things, protect them and make sure they never know they're not as good at something as somebody else because they might feel bad.' But that's not productive either because you're creating fragile kids who'll be crushed once they find out. ... Knowing what you're not good at is actually a good thing, but you don't want to attach shame to it."

### Quote 53
