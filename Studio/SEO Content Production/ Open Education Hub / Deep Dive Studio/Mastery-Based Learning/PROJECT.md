## SEO Research Summary

### Target Keywords

| Keyword | Intent | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| what is mastery learning | Informational | Primary |
| mastery-based learning | Informational | Primary |
| mastery learning vs traditional | Comparison | Secondary |
| competency-based education | Informational | Secondary |
| mastery-based grading | How-to | Long-tail |
| mastery-based learning homeschool | Transactional | Long-tail |

### 4-Test Validation Results

| Test | Result | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Search Volume** | PASS | 10-20K+ combined cluster volume |
| **Market-Centric** | PASS | 53% of teachers use it; 35% want guidance |
| **Competitive Reality** | PASS | Gap: most content targets schools, NOT homeschool parents |
| **Proprietary Advantage** | STRONG PASS | Book chapter, podcast quotes, real family stories |

### Competitive Landscape

**Who's Ranking:**
- Research.com (4,668 words) - Academic, no homeschool
- 21K School (4,668 words) - Educator guide, no parent voice
- Otus (1,200 words) - "Family" section about confusion, not empowerment
- Modern Classrooms (3,000 words) - No homeschool angle
- Wikipedia - Definitions only

**Critical Gap:** ZERO parent-first, story-driven content. Every ranking page is written for educators, by educators.

### Content Gaps to Exploit

1. Parent-first, story-driven content (our voice)
2. Day-in-the-life scenarios (what does Tuesday look like?)
3. Learning differences (ADHD, dyslexia, 2e)
4. Multiple ages/grades (real homeschool challenge)
5. Honest failure scenarios (when it doesn't work)
6. Beyond math (writing, science, history)
7. Free/low-cost implementation

## Selected Hook

**Hook #1: The LeBron Problem (Matt Bowman)**

> "LeBron James would be on academic probation. Roger Federer would flunk out. Simone Biles? A D-minus. By traditional grading standards, the greatest athletes of all time would be failures."

**Why this hook:**
- Proven angle (existing newsletter performed well)
- Memorable and shareable
- Immediately creates cognitive dissonance
- Connects sports success metrics to educational grading absurdity
