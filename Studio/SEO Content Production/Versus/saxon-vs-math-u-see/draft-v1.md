## The Bottom Line

These are two fundamentally different approaches to teaching math. Both work—but for different types of learners.

**Choose Saxon Math if:** Your child benefits from consistent daily review and doesn't need hands-on materials to understand concepts. Saxon builds strong computational skills through repetition.

**Choose Math-U-See if:** Your child is a kinesthetic learner, struggles with math anxiety, or needs to "see" concepts with manipulatives before they click. Math-U-See builds deep understanding through hands-on learning.

| Grade Levels | K-12 | K-12 |
| Price/Level | ~$100-150 | ~$115-130 |
| Manipulatives | Some (early grades) | Core to curriculum (all levels) |
| Video Instruction | Optional add-on | Included |
| Parent Involvement | Low (upper grades) | Medium |
| Best For | Drill-oriented learners | Kinesthetic/struggling learners |
| In OpenEd Marketplace | No | No |

## What Is Saxon Math?

Saxon Math was developed by John Saxon in 1981 and has become one of the most widely-used homeschool math programs. It's known for its "spiral" approach—concepts are introduced incrementally and then reviewed continuously throughout the year.

### How It Works

Instead of spending weeks on one topic and then moving on, Saxon introduces new concepts in small daily lessons, then weaves them into practice sets alongside previously learned material. A typical lesson might include 5 new problems and 25 review problems.

### Who Makes It?

Originally created by John Saxon (a former Air Force officer turned math teacher), Saxon Math is now published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. It's used in both public schools and homeschool settings.

### The Philosophy

Saxon's core belief: students need consistent, spaced repetition to retain math skills. Rather than "learn it and forget it," Saxon ensures skills are practiced again and again until they become automatic.

## What Is Math-U-See?

Math-U-See is a mastery-based curriculum created by Steve Demme, a former math teacher. It's built around a unique set of manipulative blocks and video instruction.

### How It Works

Each level focuses on ONE main topic (like multiplication or fractions) until it's fully mastered before moving on. Students watch a short video lesson, then practice with manipulative blocks to visualize the concept, then complete workbook pages.

The levels are named rather than numbered:
- **Primer** (K) - Numbers and counting
- **Alpha** (1st) - Single-digit addition/subtraction
- **Beta** (2nd) - Multi-digit addition/subtraction
- **Gamma** (3rd) - Multiplication
- **Delta** (4th) - Division
- **Epsilon** (5th) - Fractions
- **Zeta** (6th) - Decimals and percentages

### Who Makes It?

Steve Demme created Math-U-See in 1990 and it's now published by Demme Learning. Steve still appears in the instructional videos.

### The Philosophy

Math-U-See believes that students need to truly *understand* math concepts—not just memorize procedures. The manipulative blocks help students "see" what's happening mathematically before they move to abstract computation.

## Head-to-Head: Key Differences

### 1. Teaching Approach: Spiral vs Mastery

**Saxon:** Introduces concepts gradually and reviews them constantly. You'll see the same types of problems show up week after week. This repetition builds fluency but can feel tedious for some students.

**Math-U-See:** Dives deep into one topic until it's fully mastered. Spends an entire level on multiplication, for example. Great for understanding but some kids find focusing on one topic all year boring.

**Our Take:** Saxon works better for students who forget things quickly and need constant reinforcement. Math-U-See works better for students who get frustrated when they haven't fully understood something before moving on.

### 2. Hands-On Learning

**Saxon:** Uses some manipulatives in early grades but transitions to abstract math fairly quickly. By middle school, it's primarily textbook-based.

**Math-U-See:** Manipulatives are central to the curriculum through pre-algebra. Students physically build math problems with blocks, which is particularly helpful for visual and kinesthetic learners.

**Our Take:** If your child needs to touch and see math to understand it, Math-U-See is the clear winner. If your child is comfortable with abstract numbers, Saxon's approach is fine.

### 3. Parent Involvement

**Saxon:** Designed to be relatively independent, especially in upper grades. Parents grade work but don't need to teach lessons.

**Math-U-See:** Video lessons reduce parent teaching burden, but parents need to guide manipulative work in early levels. The blocks require initial involvement.

**Our Take:** Both aim to reduce parent workload, but in different ways. Saxon uses incremental simplicity; Math-U-See uses video instruction.

### 4. Pacing and Flexibility

**Saxon:** Very structured with specific daily lessons. Skipping ahead or slowing down isn't built into the design.

**Math-U-See:** More flexible. Students can spend extra time on difficult concepts or move quickly through easy ones. Placement tests help find the right starting level.

**Our Take:** Math-U-See offers more flexibility for kids who are ahead or behind in specific areas.

## Pros and Cons

### Saxon Math Pros
- Builds strong computational fluency through repetition
- Easy for parents to implement (just follow the book)
- Proven track record—decades of positive outcomes
- Works well for students who forget easily
- Available used (many editions out there)

### Saxon Math Cons
- Can feel repetitive and boring for some students
- Multiple editions with confusing naming (3rd edition? Homeschool edition?)
- Less focus on conceptual understanding
- Some students find it "dry"
- Not great for kids who need hands-on learning

### Math-U-See Pros
- Excellent for visual and kinesthetic learners
- Builds deep conceptual understanding
- Great for struggling students and math anxiety
- Video instruction included (parent doesn't need to teach)
- Manipulatives make math tangible and fun

### Math-U-See Cons
- Spending a whole year on one topic can be tedious
- Manipulatives require storage space
- Higher upfront cost if you need the block set
- Less traditional sequence (may not align with standardized tests)
- Not in OpenEd marketplace

## What Teachers Say

From conversations with OpenEd mentor teachers:

> "I am a big fan of Saxon because it is such a solid math curriculum, but to some students, it is dry. Pairing with Nicole the Math Lady helps some students."

> "Math U See is fantastic for helping students understand concepts using a more kinesthetic approach."

> "Saxon is really solid, but I was also that crazy student who said 'Saxon is so fun' and did not enjoy having to watch instructional videos."

> "Math U See might be a great fit! Great manipulatives that are key to the method, calm video lessons with an engaging math teacher in 5 minute chunks."

## The Verdict: Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Saxon Math If...
- Your child benefits from daily review and repetition
- You want a straightforward, "open and go" curriculum
- Your child doesn't need hands-on materials to understand concepts
- You value computational fluency and drill
- Your child already has decent math confidence

### Choose Math-U-See If...
- Your child is a kinesthetic or visual learner
- Your child struggles with math or has math anxiety
- You want your child to deeply understand WHY math works
- Your child needs to physically manipulate objects to learn
- You prefer video instruction over parent-led teaching

### Consider Both If...
You want the best of both worlds—Math-U-See for initial concept introduction (with manipulatives), then Saxon-style practice for fluency. Some families use Math-U-See for instruction and supplement with Saxon practice sheets.

## A Note on OpenEd

Neither Saxon Math nor Math-U-See is currently in the OpenEd marketplace. However, OpenEd families have flexibility in choosing curriculum. Many of our families use these curricula successfully.

For math practice and gap-filling, consider:
- **[IXL](/marketplace)** (free supplement in marketplace)
- **[Exact Path](/marketplace)** (diagnostic + learning path)
- **[ALEKS](/marketplace)** (adaptive math)
