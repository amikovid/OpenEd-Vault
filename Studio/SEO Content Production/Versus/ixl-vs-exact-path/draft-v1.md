## The Bottom Line

This isn't really an either/or decision. IXL and Exact Path serve different purposes—and many homeschool families use both.

**Use Exact Path for:** Identifying gaps and creating a personalized learning path. It tells you WHERE your child needs help.

**Use IXL for:** Targeted practice on specific skills. It helps you DRILL those skills until they're mastered.

**The good news:** Both are available in the OpenEd marketplace at no additional cost.

## What Is IXL?

IXL is a comprehensive practice platform covering thousands of skills across Math, English Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies. It's used by millions of students worldwide, both in schools and homeschools.

### How It Works

IXL organizes content by skill rather than lesson. Want to practice multiplying fractions? There's a specific module for that. Want to work on subject-verb agreement? There's a module for that too.

Students select skills to practice (or parents/teachers assign them), then work through adaptive problem sets. The system adjusts difficulty based on performance. You earn points and certificates as you go.

### Key Features

- **Skill-based organization:** Thousands of discrete skills to practice
- **Real-Time Diagnostic:** Pinpoints exact skill gaps
- **Immediate feedback:** Shows correct answers and explanations
- **Progress tracking:** Detailed reports on time spent and mastery level
- **Fluency Zone:** Gamified math fact practice

### The Philosophy

IXL believes in focused, repetitive practice to build mastery. It's less about learning new concepts and more about reinforcing and drilling what's been taught.

## What Is Exact Path?

Exact Path is a diagnostic-driven learning system that creates personalized learning paths for each student. It's published by Edmentum and widely used in schools.

### How It Works

Students take a comprehensive diagnostic assessment (usually 30-45 minutes per subject). The system analyzes results and creates an individualized "learning path" that targets specific gaps.

The learning path includes:
- Short instructional videos
- Practice problems
- Progress checks

As students work through their path, the system continuously adjusts based on performance.

### Key Features

- **Diagnostic-first approach:** Comprehensive assessment before learning
- **Personalized pathways:** Each student gets a custom sequence
- **Instruction included:** Videos teach concepts, not just practice
- **Gap analysis:** Clear reports on where students are struggling
- **Automatic progression:** System guides students through their path

### The Philosophy

Exact Path believes in meeting students where they are. Rather than assuming grade-level work, it identifies actual skill levels and builds from there.

## Head-to-Head: Key Differences

### 1. Primary Purpose

**IXL:** Practice and reinforcement. Assumes students have been taught concepts somewhere else; provides drill to build fluency.

**Exact Path:** Diagnosis and remediation. Identifies gaps, then provides both instruction and practice to fill them.

**Our Take:** If you know what your child needs to practice, use IXL. If you're not sure where the gaps are, start with Exact Path's diagnostic.

### 2. Approach to Learning

**IXL:** You choose the skills. It's a buffet—pick what you need, practice until mastered. Very flexible but requires parent/student direction.

**Exact Path:** The system chooses the path. After the diagnostic, students follow an automated sequence. Less flexible but more guided.

**Our Take:** IXL gives more control; Exact Path provides more structure. Some students thrive with freedom; others need the guardrails.

### 3. Instruction vs Practice

**IXL:** Minimal instruction. Brief explanations when you get something wrong, but no full lessons. It's a practice tool, not a teaching tool.

**Exact Path:** Includes instructional videos. Students watch short lessons before practicing. It can teach, not just drill.

**Our Take:** If your curriculum already teaches concepts, IXL is great for practice. If you need a tool that teaches AND practices, Exact Path does both.

### 4. Diagnostic Capabilities

**IXL:** Has a "Real-Time Diagnostic" that continuously assesses and recommends skills. Less formal than Exact Path's approach.

**Exact Path:** Built around comprehensive diagnostics (30-45 minutes per subject). Provides detailed reports on grade-level equivalents and specific skill gaps.

**Our Take:** For a one-time "where does my child stand?" assessment, Exact Path's diagnostic is more thorough. For ongoing skill tracking, IXL's continuous assessment works well.

## Pros and Cons

### IXL Pros
- Massive library of skills (K through Calculus!)
- Very flexible—practice what you want, when you want
- Great for targeted drilling
- Gamified elements keep some kids engaged
- FREE supplement in OpenEd marketplace

### IXL Cons
- Can feel repetitive ("drill and kill")

- Some kids find the point system stressful
- Requires parent/student to choose skills

### Exact Path Pros
- Comprehensive diagnostic to identify gaps
- Includes actual instruction (videos)
- Personalized learning path—less parent planning needed
- Great for catching up students who are behind
- Included in OpenEd marketplace

### Exact Path Cons
- Diagnostic takes significant time (30-45 min/subject)
- Less flexible—system controls the path
- Fewer subjects than IXL
- Can feel less game-like (motivation varies)

## What Teachers Say

From conversations with OpenEd mentor teachers:

> "I can't recommend IXL enough as a great practice resource for math. It has content from Kindergarten all the way up to Calculus so it is great to fill gaps because it is so widespread."

> "Exact Path is fantastic! Students take a diagnostic and then it personalizes the learning path to target any gaps the student may have."

> "I would start with taking the Exact Path diagnostic (free resource in their library) and you can utilize their results to target some of the skills."

> "IXL is a great review/supplement tool!"

A parent asked: *"Is Exact Path similar to IXL?"*

The answer: Similar in that both are adaptive and cover multiple subjects, but different in approach. Exact Path is more diagnostic-driven and includes instruction. IXL is more practice-focused and self-directed.

## The Verdict: Which Should You Choose?

### Use IXL If...
- You already know what skills your child needs to practice
- Your curriculum teaches concepts but lacks practice problems
- You want flexibility to jump around based on what's needed
- Your child is motivated by points and gamification
- You need practice beyond grade level (IXL goes through calculus)

### Use Exact Path If...
- You're not sure where your child's gaps are
- You want a guided, structured learning path
- You need something that teaches, not just drills
- Your child is significantly behind and needs to catch up
- You want detailed diagnostic reports for planning

### Use Both If...
Many OpenEd families use Exact Path for diagnostic assessment and initial gap-filling, then switch to IXL for ongoing practice and maintenance. This is actually a great combination:

1. **Start with Exact Path diagnostic** → Identify where gaps are
2. **Use Exact Path learning path** → Fill major gaps with instruction
3. **Switch to IXL for practice** → Drill specific skills for fluency
4. **Re-assess with Exact Path** → Check progress periodically
