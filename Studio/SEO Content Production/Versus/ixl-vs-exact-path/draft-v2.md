Both are in our marketplace. Both are free for OpenEd families. So which one?

**The short answer:** They do different things. Use Exact Path to find gaps. Use IXL to drill them.

## When to Use Exact Path

**You're not sure where the gaps are.**

"I would start with taking the Exact Path diagnostic," one mentor teacher told a parent asking for help. "You can utilize their results to target skills."

Exact Path's diagnostic takes about 45 minutes per subject. It's thorough. After that, it builds a personalized learning path—videos to teach concepts, then practice to reinforce.

**Use it when:**
- Starting homeschool and need a baseline
- Child is behind and you need to find out where
- You want something that teaches, not just drills

## When to Use IXL

**You know exactly what needs practice.**

"IXL has content from Kindergarten all the way up to Calculus," says one teacher. "It's great to fill gaps because it is so widespread."

IXL is a buffet. Pick the skill, practice until mastered. No videos, no handholding—just problems. Thousands of them.

**Use it when:**
- Your curriculum teaches but lacks practice problems
- You need to drill math facts or specific skills
- Child needs more reps than your curriculum provides

## The Real Question: Why Not Both?

Most OpenEd families use them together:

| Step | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| 1. Assess | Exact Path | Find out where gaps are |
| 2. Learn | Exact Path | Watch videos, work through path |
| 3. Drill | IXL | Practice weak skills until fluent |
| 4. Reassess | Exact Path | Check progress |

A parent asked our team: "Is Exact Path similar to IXL?"

They're similar in that both adapt to your child. But Exact Path is diagnostic-first (figures out what's wrong, then teaches). IXL is practice-first (you tell it what to drill).

**Think of it this way:**
- Exact Path = the doctor who diagnoses and prescribes
- IXL = the physical therapy that builds strength

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Exact Path better than IXL?**

Neither is better overall - they serve different purposes. Exact Path excels at diagnosing gaps and teaching concepts. IXL excels at drilling specific skills. Most OpenEd families use both.

**How long does the Exact Path diagnostic take?**

About 45 minutes per subject. It's thorough, which is why the personalized learning path is so accurate. Plan for a focused session without interruptions.

**Can IXL replace a math curriculum?**

No. IXL is practice, not instruction. It assumes concepts have been taught elsewhere. Use it alongside a curriculum or teaching tool like Khan Academy, not as a standalone program.

**Is Exact Path free?**

For OpenEd families, yes - it's included in the student library. Outside of OpenEd, it's a paid product typically sold to schools.

**Which should I start with?**

Start with Exact Path if you're unsure where your child's gaps are. The diagnostic will identify problem areas, then you can use IXL to drill those specific skills.
