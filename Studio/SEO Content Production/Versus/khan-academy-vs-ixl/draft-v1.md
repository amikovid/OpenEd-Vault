## The Bottom Line

Khan Academy and IXL are both excellent—but they do different things.

**Khan Academy** teaches. It's where you go to *learn* a concept through video lessons and guided practice.

**IXL** drills. It's where you go to *practice* a concept until it's automatic.

The best approach? Use Khan Academy to learn new material, then use IXL to reinforce it.

## What Is Khan Academy?

Khan Academy is a free, nonprofit educational platform founded by Sal Khan in 2008. It started with Sal making YouTube videos to tutor his cousins and has grown into one of the largest free learning resources in the world.

### How It Works

Khan Academy is organized into courses (like "Algebra 1" or "World History"). Each course contains:
- **Video lessons:** Short explanations of concepts (usually 5-15 minutes)
- **Practice problems:** Questions to test understanding
- **Mastery challenges:** Review quizzes that adapt based on performance

Students can follow a structured course path or jump to specific topics they need help with.

### Key Features

- **100% free:** No subscriptions, no premium tiers
- **Video instruction:** Learn concepts from scratch
- **Khanmigo:** New AI tutor for personalized help (requires donation)
- **Test prep:** SAT, LSAT, and other standardized tests
- **Broad subjects:** Math, science, humanities, economics, test prep

### The Philosophy

"A free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere." Khan Academy believes quality education shouldn't be gatekept by cost. Sal Khan's teaching style is conversational and accessible.

## What Is IXL?

IXL is a subscription-based practice platform used by millions of students. It focuses on adaptive practice across thousands of specific skills.

### How It Works

IXL organizes content by skill rather than course. Each skill has its own practice module with unlimited problems. The system adapts difficulty based on performance—get questions right, and they get harder; get them wrong, and you get more practice at that level.

Students earn points and awards as they practice, creating a gamified experience.

### Key Features

- **Massive skill library:** Thousands of discrete skills, K-Calculus
- **Adaptive practice:** Difficulty adjusts in real-time
- **Detailed analytics:** SmartScore tracking, time-on-task, recommendations
- **Diagnostic:** Real-Time Diagnostic identifies gaps
- **Immediate feedback:** Explanations when you get something wrong

### The Philosophy

Practice makes permanent. IXL believes that focused, repetitive practice on specific skills builds lasting fluency. It's designed for drilling, not teaching.

## Head-to-Head: Key Differences

### 1. Teaching vs Practice

**Khan Academy:** Teaches concepts from scratch. Watch a video, then try some problems. Great for learning something new.

**IXL:** Assumes you've been taught elsewhere. It's pure practice—thousands of problems to drill skills. Great for reinforcement.

**Our Take:** This is the fundamental difference. Khan teaches; IXL drills. Most students need both.

### 2. Cost

**Khan Academy:** Completely free. Always has been, always will be (it's a nonprofit).

**IXL:** Paid subscription ($9.95/month for one subject, up to $20/month for family plans). BUT—it's available FREE in the OpenEd marketplace.

**Our Take:** For non-OpenEd families, this is a significant difference. For OpenEd families, both are effectively free.

### 3. Depth of Practice

**Khan Academy:** Practice is available but limited. Maybe 10-20 problems per concept before you "master" it.

**IXL:** Unlimited practice. Each skill has an endless supply of problems at varying difficulty levels.

**Our Take:** If your child needs extensive drill to build fluency, IXL wins hands down. Khan is enough for students who grasp concepts quickly.

### 4. Progress Tracking

**Khan Academy:** Basic progress tracking. You can see mastery levels and time spent, but analytics are limited.

**IXL:** Detailed analytics. SmartScore for each skill, time tracking, diagnostic reports, recommendations. Parents and teachers can see exactly where students struggle.

**Our Take:** If data-driven instruction matters to you, IXL's reporting is far superior.

### 5. AI and Personalization

**Khan Academy:** Now offers Khanmigo, an AI tutor powered by GPT-4. It can answer questions, guide through problems, and provide personalized help. (Requires donation of $4+/month)

**IXL:** No AI tutor. Adaptive practice based on performance, but no conversational AI.

**Our Take:** Khanmigo is a genuine innovation. If your child benefits from being able to "ask" for help, Khan Academy's AI tutor is unique.

## What Teachers Say

From conversations with OpenEd mentor teachers:

> "I can't recommend IXL enough as a great practice resource for math."

> "Khan Academy is great for teaching concepts. We use it to reinforce when students have gaps."

> "IXL has content from Kindergarten all the way up to Calculus, so it is great to fill gaps because it is so widespread."

A common pattern we see: Parents use Khan Academy to introduce new topics, then use IXL to drill until fluent.

## The Verdict: Which Should You Choose?

### Use Khan Academy If...
- You need to learn concepts from scratch (no curriculum yet)
- You're on a tight budget (it's free!)
- Your child learns well from video instruction
- You want access to Khanmigo AI tutor
- You need humanities or test prep content

### Use IXL If...
- Your child needs extensive practice to build fluency
- You want detailed progress tracking and diagnostics
- Your curriculum teaches but lacks practice problems
- Your child is motivated by points and gamification
- You're an OpenEd family (it's FREE in marketplace)

### Use Both If...
This is actually the most common recommendation. They complement each other perfectly:

1. **Khan Academy for instruction** → Watch video, understand concept
2. **IXL for practice** → Drill until fluent
3. **Khan for review** → Come back when you forget
4. **IXL for diagnostics** → Identify remaining gaps

Many successful homeschool families use this exact combination.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Khan Academy really free?**

Yes, 100% free. Khan Academy is a nonprofit founded on the principle that quality education should be accessible to everyone. There are no hidden costs or premium tiers for the core content.

**Is IXL worth the money?**

For many families, yes - especially if your child needs extensive practice. IXL's adaptive system and detailed progress tracking justify the cost for students who benefit from drill. For OpenEd families, it's free in the marketplace.

**Can I use Khan Academy as a full math curriculum?**

Khan Academy can serve as a primary math resource, but it works better as a teaching tool than a complete curriculum. Many families pair it with a structured curriculum and use Khan for instruction when concepts need explanation.

**Which is better for struggling math students?**

Both can help, but in different ways. Khan Academy's video instruction helps students who need concepts explained. IXL's adaptive practice helps students who understand but need more repetition to build fluency.

**Do colleges accept Khan Academy?**

Khan Academy itself isn't a curriculum that appears on transcripts, but the SAT prep is widely respected. Many homeschool families use Khan alongside accredited programs.
