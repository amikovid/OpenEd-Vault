# Versus Comparisons

**Goal:** Capture high-intent "X vs Y" searches with genuinely helpful comparison content.

**Approach:** Incremental - template approval first, then scale production.

---

## Why Versus Content Works

- **High commercial intent** - People searching "X vs Y" are close to a decision
- **Featured snippet opportunity** - Google loves comparison tables
- **Low effort per page** - Once template is proven, can scale quickly
- **Builds authority** - Positions OpenEd as the trusted advisor

---

## The Risk: Mass Replication Pitfalls

From 2025-2026 SEO research (Google Helpful Content Update):

### What Gets Penalized
- Thin pages with just a comparison table and no insight
- Cookie-cutter content with only product names swapped
- Content that doesn't add value beyond what's on product pages
- AI-generated comparisons without human expertise

### What Works
- Genuine first-hand experience with both products
- Specific use-case recommendations ("X is better for Y situation")
- Honest pros/cons that you won't find on vendor sites
- Original data or insights (e.g., "we surveyed 100 parents...")
- Clear editorial voice and perspective

---

## Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)

Before publishing ANY versus page, it must pass:

### Gate 1: Gap Analysis
- [ ] Does this comparison already exist from a credible source?
- [ ] If yes, what NEW value can we add?
- [ ] Do we have genuine insight about both options?

### Gate 2: Content Depth
- [ ] At least 1,500 words of substantive comparison
- [ ] Specific use-case recommendations (not "it depends")
- [ ] At least 3 genuine differentiators identified
- [ ] Honest criticism of BOTH options (not just favoring one)

### Gate 3: Original Value
- [ ] Include at least one insight you can't find elsewhere
- [ ] Reference real user experience (podcast quotes, testimonials)
- [ ] Provide clear winner recommendation for specific audiences

## Process: How to Scale Without Getting Penalized

### Phase 1: Validate Template (Current)
1. Get Charlie approval on template above
2. Write 2-3 pilot pages manually (high-quality)
3. Measure performance (rankings, engagement)
4. Refine template based on results

### Phase 2: Keyword Discovery
1. Pull top "vs" combinations from DataForSEO
2. Filter by: search volume > 100, relevance to our tools
3. Check existing SERP - can we add value?
4. Prioritize by gap opportunity

### Phase 3: Scaled Production
1. For each approved comparison:
   - Run Gap Analysis (Gate 1)
   - Pull source material (our reviews, podcasts, vendor sites)
   - Draft with template
   - Quality check (Gates 2 & 3)
   - Publish
2. Batch by category (all math comparisons, then all pedagogy, etc.)

### Phase 4: Monitoring
- Track rankings weekly for first month
- Monitor for any traffic drops (signal of quality issue)
- Iterate on underperformers

---

## DataForSEO Query Needed

To find top "vs" combinations, need to run:

```
Keywords containing:
- "vs" + [curriculum names from our tools database]
- "vs" + [pedagogy terms: homeschool, classical, montessori, charlotte mason]
- "compared to" + [curriculum names]
- "[product] alternative"

Filter: 
- Search volume > 100
- Relevance to education/homeschool
```

---

## Our Unfair Advantage: Slack Data

OpenEd has internal Slack channels where mentor teachers discuss curriculum daily. This is **genuine first-hand experience** that competitors don't have.

### Key Channels to Mine
- **#recommendations** - Teachers answering parent questions about curriculum
- **#curriculum-feedback** - Direct feedback on tools families are using
- **[Other channels TBD]** - Need to audit for curriculum discussions

### What We Can Extract
- Real teacher opinions on specific curriculum
- "This works for X type of learner, not for Y"
- Specific pros/cons from daily use
- Parent feedback relayed through teachers

### Slack Mining Process
1. **Install Slack MCP** (TODO) - Enable Claude Code to query Slack directly
2. **Query by curriculum name** - Pull all mentions of specific tools
3. **Synthesize perspectives** - Combine into authentic "What Teachers Say" sections
4. **Verify with team** - Ensure quotes are appropriate to publish (anonymized if needed)

### Example Queries (Once Slack MCP Installed)
```
Search #recommendations for: "Math Academy"
Search #recommendations for: "Saxon Math"
Search #recommendations for: "Good and the Beautiful"
```

This gives us the E-E-A-T signal Google wants: **real experience from real educators**.

---

## What We Need Before Scaling

1. **Template Approval** - Charlie reviews this PROJECT.md
2. **Slack MCP Installation** - Enable curriculum data extraction
3. **Pilot Pages** - Write 2-3 manually using Slack data, measure results
4. **Source Material Audit** - Which products have we discussed in Slack?
5. **Gap Analysis Protocol** - Who checks if content already exists?
6. **Teacher Permission** - Confirm we can use anonymized quotes
