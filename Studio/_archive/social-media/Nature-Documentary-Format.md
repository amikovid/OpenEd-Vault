**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Cadence:** TBD (test with 2-3 initially)

## The Concept

David Attenborough-style narration over homeschool B-roll. Treats homeschool families like wildlife specimens - affectionate, observational humor that makes the audience feel seen.

> "Here we observe the homeschool mother in her natural habitat... the dining room table, covered in manipulatives and yesterday's lunch..."

## Why It Works

From Tom Orbach's viral formula: **Create the world's first {FORMAT} for {AUDIENCE}**

- **Format:** Nature documentary (universally recognized)
- **Audience:** Homeschool families
- **Cognitive dissonance:** The serious documentary tone applied to everyday chaos creates shareability

The inside jokes make viewers feel "they GET us" - the same mechanic that made CISOtopia go viral.

## Species Profiles

### The Charlotte Mason Purist
- Migratory, found near nature trails and used bookstores
- Recognizable by canvas tote bags filled with living books
- Feeds on tea and narration
- Call: "We don't do worksheets"

### The Classical Homeschooler
- Territorial, guards Latin materials
- Nesting behavior includes timeline walls and Great Books collections
- Active during rhetoric stage (ages 14-18)
- Call: "But have you read the original Greek?"

### The Curriculum Collector
- Hoarding behavior, accumulates unused workbooks
- Habitat: Co-op sale tables, homeschool conventions
- Seasonal migration to curriculum fairs
- Call: "I'm just researching for next year"

### The Unschooler
- Nomadic, follows child's interests wherever they lead
- No fixed habitat - learning happens everywhere
- Difficult to observe as they blend into everyday life
- Call: "Life is the curriculum"

### The Traditional Homeschooler
- Highly structured, operates on predictable schedule
- Habitat: Dedicated school room with desks and flag
- Recognizable by printed grade-level checklists
- Call: "We do school from 8 to 2"

### The Eclectic Homeschooler
- Adaptive species, borrows traits from all others
- Habitat varies by subject and season
- Opportunistic feeder - uses whatever works
- Call: "We take the best of everything"

## Sample Scripts

### Script 1: The Dining Room Table

> "Here we observe the homeschool mother in her natural habitat - the dining room table. Notice how she has carved out a small workspace among the manipulatives, yesterday's read-aloud, and an inexplicable pile of rocks her children call 'a collection.'
>
> She will defend this territory fiercely. The table has not been used for dining since 2019."

### Script 2: The Curriculum Collector

> "We've spotted a rare specimen - the Curriculum Collector at a used book sale. Watch as she adds yet another math curriculum to her cart, despite owning seven at home.
>
> 'I might need it someday,' she tells herself. She will not. But the thrill of the hunt is its own reward."

### Script 3: The 10am Grocery Run

> "The homeschool family has been spotted at the grocery store. It is 10am on a Tuesday. The children are in pajama pants.
>
> A concerned citizen approaches. 'No school today?'
>
> The mother smiles. She has answered this question 347 times. 'This IS school,' she replies, gesturing vaguely at the produce section."

## Production Notes

**Voice:** Calm, observational, BBC documentary tone. Not mocking - affectionate. The humor comes from the contrast between serious narration and mundane reality.

**Visuals:**
- Stock footage of families at home, libraries, nature
- Original B-roll if available (co-ops, field trips, messy tables)
- Could use AI-generated footage for establishing shots

**Audio:**
- Voiceover (male British accent ideal, or deadpan American)
- Optional: subtle nature documentary score underneath

**Text overlay:** Minimal - let the VO carry it. Maybe species name as lower third.

## Tie-ins

- Could drive traffic to Curriculove quiz ("Find your homeschool species")
- Natural spin-off content for each philosophy
- Pairs with existing Horse Mask format (Ed reacting to documentary footage)

---

## Reference

Inspired by accounts that apply documentary style to everyday life - the format is proven on social, just not yet applied to homeschoolers.
