# DEEP DIVE: Best Homeschool Science Curriculum

Science is the study of how the world works—it should be the most exciting subject of all. So why do so many students find it boring?

Adam Savage, the former MythBusters host, [diagnosed the disconnect](https://www.tiktok.com/@openedhq/video/7493709540093971754) (in our most viral social media post ever):

"When we teach kids that science and math and engineering are all things to memorize, we're missing the point. These are unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested."

In an analogy that Ed the Horse would love, Savage reminds us that we call math and science "fields of knowledge" because they're open-ended—ripe for curious minds to explore.

At [OpenEd](https://www.notion.so/OED-Mon-Nov-17-2a7afe52ef5980c8bce8dc5dd9e7d490?pvs=21), we've watched thousands of families rebuild their relationship with science. This guide gathers the most-loved recommendations from our teachers and families—tested, hands-on programs organized by type and grade level, honest trade-offs, and high-quality free resources. Our goal: not to get through the material, but to keep *wonder* alive.

Schools often teach science backwards—theory first, hoping curiosity follows. Natural learning does the opposite. Kids are born scientists. Every toddler dropping their spoon is running an experiment. The best curricula flip the order: wonder first, explanation later.

What your homeschool lacks in lab equipment, it makes up in time for deep projects and flexibility to follow curiosity wherever it leads. Most school 'lab work' is performative anyway—following recipes to get expected results, often fudging observations to match the textbook.

Stop trying to replicate the traditional science classroom when you can do something *better*.

# PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: Why Your ADHD Kid "Won't Listen" (It's Not What You Think)

Dr. Amy Moore joined Ela Richmond on the OpenEd podcast to unpack something that frustrates countless families: a child who seems to ignore you the moment you raise your voice. Turns out that's not a coincidence. It's not always defiance, either. Sometimes it's just neurology.

Dr. Moore explains that when we yell, our kids' brains literally can't hear us the way we think they can. There's something called auditory exclusion that kicks in during fight-or-flight. The brain is designed to hear low-frequency survival sounds—like a tiger rustling in the bush—not mom's voice. So when you think your child is ignoring you, consider the fact that they're struggling to process the words at all.

What can you do instead? Lower your voice. Soften your posture. Remove the noise. Then invite problem-solving: "I notice this seems really hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier."

# Trends We're Following

**Every Hour Costs Them**

A new study tracking 5,400 kids from early childhood through grade six found that **every additional hour of daily screen time was associated with a 9-10% lower likelihood of achieving higher test scores in reading and math**. Of course, not all screen time is created equal. Doomscrolling isn't the same as focused work in an adaptive learning app or creating worlds in Minecraft. But the data is clear: quantity matters, and quality matters more. ([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/children-kids-parents-screens-hampering-learning-10869823))

**Curiosity Doesn't Die from Lack of Enrichment**

Austin Scholar breaks down the real culprit behind dead-eyed teenagers who only care if something's "on the test": parents who light up about report cards but yawn through explanations of how ant colonies work. Research from Susan Engel at Williams College shows curiosity drops dramatically around third grade (right when standardized testing kicks in). But the *steepest* drops happen in households where parents frequently ask about grades and rarely ask about interests. **The same kid will endure significantly more failure and frustration when pursuing answers to their own questions versus assigned ones.** She suggests a "Question Project" as one solution, in which kids pose one real question per week and explore it like actual researchers. ([Austin Scholar](https://x.com/flowidealism/status/1794541962055315951))

**Homeschooling Growth by State Since 2017**

This [visualization tracking homeschool growth state by state](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1989387979509617067) since 2017-2018 shows which states are experiencing the fastest growth in homeschooling. What color is your state? Chime in on Facebook. ([@rebeleducator](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1989387979509617067))

**Teach the Child, Not the Grade Level**

From Simply Charlotte Mason: **"It's very common for a child to be ready for, say, third-grade math skills while at the same time be working on second-grade or even first-grade reading skills. That's fine!"** Grade levels persist not because they're good for kids but because they're efficient for institutions. Charlotte Mason understood this over a century ago: Kids don't develop like cogs on an assembly line. Yet we still force them into boxes.

# DEEP DIVE: Best Homeschool Science Curriculum | OpenEd

Science is the study of how the world works—it should be the most exciting subject of all. So why do so many students find it boring?

Adam Savage, the former MythBusters host, [diagnosed the disconnect](https://www.tiktok.com/@openedhq/video/7493709540093971754): "When we teach kids that science and math and engineering are all things to memorize, we're missing the point. These are unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested." We call these "fields" because they're open-ended—ripe for curious minds to explore.

At [OpenEd](https://www.notion.so/OED-Mon-Nov-17-2a7afe52ef5980c8bce8dc5dd9e7d490?pvs=21), we've watched thousands of families rebuild their relationship with science. This guide gathers the most-loved recommendations from our teachers and families—tested, hands-on programs organized by type and grade level, honest trade-offs, and high-quality free resources. Our goal: not to get through the material, but to keep *wonder* alive.

Schools often teach science backwards—theory first, hoping curiosity follows. Natural learning does the opposite. Kids are born scientists. Every toddler dropping their spoon is running an experiment. The best curricula flip the order: wonder first, explanation later.

What your homeschool lacks in lab equipment, it makes up in time for deep projects and flexibility to follow curiosity wherever it leads. Most school 'lab work' is performative anyway—following recipes to get expected results, often fudging observations to match the textbook.

Stop trying to replicate the traditional science classroom when you can do something *better*.

We've identified five main approaches and put together a guide on how to mix and match the best of each.

**Ela Richmond** (00:00)
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your host, Ela. Today I'm joined by Dr. Amy Moore. Let me jump straight into it. What led you to education?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (00:17)
That's a great question. My undergraduate degree is in psychology. After graduating, I took a job as a teacher's assistant at a preschool and fell in love with working with kids. I went to the University of South Carolina for their new master's program in education, and I loved it so much I pursued that instead of traditional psychology grad school.

I spent ten years as a child development specialist with Air Force child development and youth programs. I also spent time in the classroom as a teacher. But working with so many children and families struggling with neurodivergent diagnoses, I kept thinking: we're missing something in the classroom. The curriculum is great, but something's missing.

So I went back to school and got my PhD in psychology to really understand the brain—how it learns and what we need to bring back to classrooms, whether homeschooling, traditional, or early childhood, to help struggling kids. Now I straddle the psychology and education space because that's where my passion lies.

**Ela Richmond** (02:07)
That's beautiful. I'm curious why you were so interested in understanding the underlying why. Your teaching background adds another layer—you experienced what teachers experience: kids not being receptive. But you didn't take the easy road. You didn't label these kids as troubled or just move on. Why was your initial reaction to get curious about helping families solve these underlying issues?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (02:59)
I was a struggling student. I was smart and did well academically, but I spent more time in the hallway than the classroom in middle school because I talked too much, was constantly distracted, or distracted the class. I was diagnosed with ADHD in college—after failing out twice. Not because I couldn't do the work, but because I wouldn't go to class, would sleep through class, or didn't feel like it.

My mom, also a child development specialist, said, "I think you have ADHD." This was the eighties when hyperactive boys were mainly diagnosed, but she saw the symptoms. I was assessed and was off the charts ADHD. Once medicated, I did really well through college and grad school and got my life back on track.

As I worked with children and families, I thought: we can't miss these things. We have to identify this early so kids don't struggle so much. I was drawn to struggling kids with ADHD—kids everyone else was frustrated with but that I understood. I wanted to help, but I didn't have enough tools because medication was the only ADHD intervention available. These kids spend eight to ten hours with us daily. We have to be able to do more.

**Ela Richmond** (04:55)
That makes so much sense. You had personal understanding of what it was like being that kid. You found a tool that worked, got through college, succeeded, and then looked at struggling kids and said, "Let me help you find more tools." I love that.

What's the common experience of families with ADHD? Our audience is mostly homeschool families who aren't getting teacher reports—they're experiencing it themselves. What's step one when you chat with families?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (06:31)
Do you want the conversation before official diagnosis or after?

**Ela Richmond** (06:48)
The first conversation—when a parent doesn't know if their kid has ADHD or what to look into.

**Dr. Amy Moore** (07:15)
We tend to say "my kid can't focus" or "can't pay attention," but our brains shift attention four times a second. That's normal. Your brain focuses on a task, scans the environment for threats, comes back to the task. It's designed for survival—checking for tigers while working. That's healthy brain function.

The ADHD brain struggles to distinguish between minor inconveniences and crises. Everything feels important. ADHD brains are also super curious, so they're easily pulled into environmental distractions.

The first question I ask parents: Is your child tired, hungry, sick, or stressed? That's where we start. If not, let's talk about stress. A child can lose focus because the task is too hard or they lack the skill. That causes stress and frustration.

When stressed, the amygdala sets off an alarm—"danger, crisis, you're frustrated"—and hijacks the prefrontal cortex, which handles reasoning, thinking, planning, and execution. Then we can't think or learn.

What we interpret as defiance is typically not defiance. "I'm not doing this" isn't willful. It's "this is too hard and I'm frustrated, and I don't know how to communicate that." So we have to get curious. We have to be patient and learn to regulate our own emotions first.

**Ela Richmond** (10:32)
Are there ways to give kids more ability to communicate instead of seeming defiant?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (11:06)
It's probably ninety-nine percent emotional response. We have to get curious and flexible—put on our detective hat and wonder what's happening. This is an opportunity to teach problem-solving skills. When we involve kids in solving problems, we give them power and control, building relational equity. They feel heard and respected.

But something very important happens when we yell. That alarm bell goes off, they go into fight, flight, or freeze. The ears can't process language in fight-or-flight. It's called auditory exclusion.

**Dr. Amy Moore** (12:32)
The brain is intelligently designed to only hear low-frequency sounds—like a tiger rustling in the bush behind us—not mom's voice yelling. So when you yell at your child, it looks like they're ignoring you, but they're struggling to hear the words because they're in fight-or-flight.

Everything that comes out of your mouth either strengthens or weakens the connection with your child. Yelling weakens that connection. You destroy relational equity and have repair work to do.

We have to get curious, be patient, and learn to regulate our own emotions first. Start by lowering your voice volume, softening your facial expression, relaxing your body posture, removing excess noise and light. Lower the temperature on the fire at the dining room table. Then say something like, "I notice this seems really hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier. Let's talk about some options."

Go into problem-solving mode. Create an invitation for your child to safely say, "Yes, it is too hard." Then: "Yesterday you mastered this concept. Let's go back to what we talked about. Go back a step to where you could do it, then build slowly on this next concept you're struggling with."

When we're in emotional fight-or-flight, that part of the brain is most active. But if we can name the emotion, it activates the language center, pulling us out of our amygdala. You've probably heard "have to name it to tame it"—that's absolutely right. Tell your child: "It seems like you're frustrated. Yeah, I get frustrated when I can't do something hard too. This is what I do."

**Ela Richmond** (15:38)
From a parent perspective, what's the hardest part about raising children with ADHD and how do you help parents? What you're describing—not yelling, staying patient—is very hard. But especially with ADHD kids, the way they respond to you is really important. Parents have responsibility to be the way their child needs them to be. Where do you help parents begin?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (16:45)
We parent the way we were parented. Just because you were parented that way and turned out okay doesn't mean it'll work for your child. You need to parent your child, not the way you were necessarily parented. We didn't wear seatbelts, we turned out okay, but seatbelts are safer. Just because your parent yelled and you behaved doesn't mean that's how your child will respond or that it's the healthiest way to raise a child.

If your current parenting strategy isn't working—if you're here asking for help—something needs to change. We have to regulate our own emotions first. We cannot access grace when emotionally dysregulated. Recognize when you're getting upset or frustrated. Take a step back and say, "I need a ten-minute break. You take a break too."

Learn breathing exercises, grounding exercises. Keep a frozen eye mask in your freezer—put it on your eyes for thirty seconds and it lowers fight-or-flight activation. Vibrate your vagus nerve to activate your parasympathetic nervous system and regulate your emotions.

**Dr. Amy Moore** (18:12)
Emotions are contagious. We have smart cells in our brains called mirror neurons. Their effect is strongest between people with close relationships. So my emotions as a mom are contagious to my child. The easiest illustration: when someone yawns, you yawn back. That's a mirror neuron. We have to regulate our emotions, which helps co-regulate our child's emotions. This starts with us.

Adopt a mindset of curiosity. Say, "Hey, this isn't working. What should I do differently?" That's the first step—learning to regulate our emotions and recognizing there are real, measurable differences in ADHD brains.

There's less blood flow to the prefrontal cortex, so less oxygen in the area responsible for thinking, reasoning, planning, and execution. The connection between amygdala and prefrontal cortex is disrupted. Brain volume is smaller. Electrical activity is different. There are problems with dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. Either not enough dopamine crosses the synaptic cleft, sending neurons reabsorb it too quickly, or dopamine receptors can't catch the dopamine.

When parents understand there are connectivity differences, oxygen differences, brain volume differences, and chemical differences, empathy builds. "That's why my child is struggling. They aren't doing this to me. They're struggling, and it's my job as a loving parent to help." Homeschooling parents already have the mindset that their child needs something different. That's half the battle.

**Ela Richmond** (21:56)
There's education—fitting it to how your child's brain works. But also regular life and behavior. How do we help kids develop the skills to live in the world, respond to frustration, respond to stress? These are foundational. What frameworks should homeschool families start with?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (23:40)
First, make sure children get restorative sleep. Tired children cannot regulate emotions. Sleep deprivation reduces dopamine sensitivity and the ability to recognize facial expressions accurately. If we can't read faces accurately, we might respond emotionally inappropriately.

During the day, as we think, learn, walk, talk, and live, we use up neurotransmitters and leave toxins. During sleep, the brain shrinks slightly to allow the glymphatic system to release cerebrospinal fluid that literally washes the brain—like a car wash rinsing garbage and toxins left behind during the day. Without this, toxins build up and neurons can't communicate effectively.

Sleep also consolidates memories. Everything learned during the day is consolidated during sleep. That can't happen without adequate sleep. Help your kids get restorative sleep. Make bedtime part of your structured day, like math or reading time, not just when you're exhausted and want them gone.

Most ADHD kids have sensory processing issues—they're sensory seekers or avoiders. Sensory seekers are running laps around the living room at 8 p.m., throwing themselves on couches. They haven't gotten enough sensory input, so they seek it. They need swings in bedrooms, movement during stories, tight pressure therapy, weighted blankets.

Sensory avoiders can't stand clothing tags or electric toothbrushes. They need soft tagless pajamas, soft sheets, minimal bedroom clutter. Even toothpaste flavor matters. Sensory seekers choose bold, bright flavors.

Reduce screens—they produce blue light, which tells the brain it's daylight and inhibits melatonin release. If kids haven't gotten enough physical activity, they won't sleep well either. Work on restorative sleep and recognizing contributors to sleep deprivation first.

**Ela Richmond** (30:15)
You mentioned curating environments for kids' needs. Most parents want to do that, but don't know where to start—from swing bedrooms to toothbrush sounds to toothpaste flavor. How do families find resources? Do they need to curate if they want to? What are the most important things to start with?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (30:15)
If your child has ADHD, you already know these patterns. You know they're constantly seeking activity, worse in evenings—that probably means sensory seeker. You know if they can't stand itchy fabrics or insist you cut tags out. You know from behavior patterns.

A great resource is the Homeschool OT—Sarah Collins. Occupational therapists are experts on sensory issues. Her podcast and website discuss sensory seekers and avoiders. You can Google "bedtime ideas for sensory seekers" or "sensory avoiders"—there are checklists everywhere. Also look up Dr. Sensory—she had great ideas on my podcast.

# Trends we’re following

- Every Hour Costs Them
    
    [Newsweek reports](https://www.newsweek.com/children-kids-parents-screens-hampering-learning-10869823) on a new study that tracked 5,400 kids from early childhood through grade six, which found that every additional hour of daily screen time was associated with a 9-10% lower likelihood of achieving higher test scores in reading and math.
    
    Of course, not all screen time is created equal. Doomscrolling isn't the same as focused time in an adaptive learning app or creating worlds in Minecraft.

- Curiosity Doesn't Die from Lack of Enrichment
    
    Austin Scholar's latest breaks down the real culprit behind dead-eyed teenagers who only care if it's "on the test": parents who light up about report cards but yawn through explanations of how ant colonies work.
    
    Research from Susan Engel at Williams College shows curiosity drops dramatically around third grade—right when standardized testing kicks in. But the steepest drops happen in households where parents frequently ask about grades and rarely ask about interests. **The same kid will endure significantly more failure and frustration when pursuing answers to their own questions versus assigned ones.**
    
    Her solution? The Question Project—where kids pose one real question per week and explore it like actual researchers. No homework questions. No gotchas. Just genuine curiosity treated with the dignity it deserves.

[This visualization](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1989387979509617067) tracks how much homeschooling has increased state by state since 2017-2018, and some regions have seen growth that can only be described as a quiet revolution.
    
    The map doesn't just show numbers—it shows families voting with their feet, one withdrawal form at a time.

- Teach the Child, Not the Grade Level
    
    From [Simply Charlotte Mason](https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/teach-your-child-not-a-grade-level/):
    
    **"It's very common for a child to be ready for, say, third-grade math skills while at the same time be working on second-grade or even first-grade reading skills. That's fine!"**
    
    In other words, teach the *child*, not the *grade level*.
    
    We all know the story by now: Horace Mann copied the "Prussian Model" of education in the 1800s to solve a problem: a shortage of factory workers. 
    
    Today, grade levels persists not because it's good for kids but because it's efficient for institutions. Charlotte Mason understood this over a century ago: Kids don't develop like cogs on an assembly line.

### Boring TV

Emily Phillips of [Withyweather Farm & School](https://withyweather.substack.com/p/boring-tv-for-children) curated a list of "boring" TV that won't overstimulate young minds. Here are some of her top picks:

1. [**Beatrix Potter animations**](https://a.co/d/fr6iiLz) — Beautiful, zero manipulation.
2. [**Roy Underhill's Woodwright's Shop**](https://www.pbs.org/show/woodwrights-shop) — Watch craftsmanship happen slowly.
3. [**David Macaulay's architectural histories**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/building-big) — Learning built into stories.
4. [**My Neighbor Totoro**](https://watch.plex.tv/movie/my-neighbor-totoro) — Magical animation without psychological manipulation.
5. [**Irish Hands**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7IPYOo_EYFVYxYB94gCwEgFt8oLS4pMI) — More traditional craftspeople (**bonus:** this time they’re *Irish*).

These shows aren't designed to be engaging in the modern sense. On the contrary, they demand attention (without hijacking it). Once kids have watched enough "boring" content, regular activities become interesting again.

A parent is conflicted about whether to homeschool their socially struggling 6-year-old son, who expresses a desire to be homeschooled despite being in a good school. The parent worries about the impact on his social skills and the potential chaos of homeschooling due to their part-time work. They are also considering therapy for his anxiety but are uncertain if homeschooling would help or hinder his social development in the long run.
