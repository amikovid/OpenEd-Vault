Ela Bass (00:00)
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ela, and today we're joined by Janssen Bradshaw. You probably know her from Everyday Reading, the beloved blog that's become a go-to place for book recommendations and reading inspiration. She's also a mom and co-founder of Savvy Learning, which is live in the OpenEd marketplace.
I'm really curious—in today's world with screens competing for children's attention, how did you help your kids fall in love with reading?
Janssen Bradshaw (00:54)
I grew up with a strong love of reading, and that was really important to me with my own kids. Here's the answer nobody likes: if you have a lot of screens competing, it's hard for books to compete with the dopamine rush of a screen. I say that not just about kids, but for me personally—as phones and television become more part of our lives, I have to work harder to make time for reading.
From when my first child was born, I was thoughtful about screens in our family. I wanted books and reading first, with that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens. My oldest is now 15 and my youngest is almost nine. I love screens—my whole living is made online. I just want to ensure a strong balance, with books first before competing with everything else.
Ela Bass (02:37)
What was your environment like as a kid and now with your family?
Janssen Bradshaw (02:54)
We have a large TV in our basement, but not in our family room. Growing up, the TV wasn't on as background noise. I don't like that—it's overstimulating for me. We turn it on when actually watching something, almost always as a family, not much solo watching.
We have tons of books. Our kids have books in their rooms, a big library bookshelf in our living room, built-in bookshelves, and a huge floor-to-ceiling bookshelf in our playroom. We go to the library a lot. We're a huge audiobook family with Yoto players and Echo Dots for Audible books.
I read aloud to my kids almost every night. Part of our homeschool day—the last part before lunch—is family reading where everybody brings books to the living room and we all read for 30 minutes. That's my favorite part of the day, ensuring I get good reading time as my job has gotten busier.
I was homeschooled from kindergarten until high school. My mom was an English major and huge reader, my dad too. She read tons aloud and individually with all of us as part of our homeschool day. Even in high school, we'd get two copies of a book and read alternating pages—Pride and Prejudice, Picture of Dorian Gray, Tale of Two Cities, Huckleberry Finn. Books that if you hand to a 14-year-old, they might struggle. But with an adult to ensure reasonable pacing and highlight important details, it becomes a positive experience.
Ela Bass (05:42)
Did I hear you say you have a library bookshelf?
Janssen Bradshaw (05:45)
Yes! My husband really doesn't like losing library books. Having one place where they all live—when they come home, you know where they go, and when returning them, you know where they are.
Ela Bass (06:02)
That's brilliant. How many books do you have in your home?
Janssen Bradshaw (06:10)
Easily 2,000 to 5,000. But remember, I'm a book blogger and Instagrammer. I get books from publishers, was an elementary school librarian before kids, attend conferences. My book experience isn't typical because it's so much of my job.
Ela Bass (06:42)
That makes sense. What age did you start introducing books, and how do you handle distractions with multiple children?
Janssen Bradshaw (08:04)
When I read aloud at night, it's everybody together. I choose a book targeting my two middle kids—maybe a step down for my 15-year-old, a stretch for my youngest.
With multiple kids, embrace a little chaos—it won't be a Norman Rockwell painting. One of my best tricks: my kids are almost always doing something while I read. Legos, coloring, Play-Doh, to keep hands busy. I'm the same as an adult—I do dishes, fold laundry, work on puzzles, or walk while listening to audiobooks rather than just sitting. It's hard for kids and adults to just sit and listen.
Ela Bass (09:24)
Do you pair it with activities they already like?
Janssen Bradshaw (09:37)
Yes, like last night I asked, "Does anybody want to color? Get your coloring stuff. You guys do Legos, get them out and we'll clean up when we're done reading." I give them a few minutes to figure out what they'll do while I read.
Ela Bass (09:56)
Have you seen reading impact your family culture?
Janssen Bradshaw (10:03)
Absolutely. My kids have shared identity around specific books and series. The Penderwicks, a five-book series—my kids have listened maybe 15 or 20 times through. I have four girls, this series has four sisters, so they'll call each other by character names or use shorthand referencing characters or phrases.
Another series they love is Nanny Piggins—Australian, outrageously weird. When neighborhood kids play Taboo, they say, "You cannot use Nanny Piggins references because you can make any connection."
I saw similar things growing up with comic strips my family loved. Four or five years ago, my siblings and I visited my parents without spouses or grandkids, just the original six. At breakfast, my mom brought comic books we still had and we sat reading, "Do you remember this one?" Such a fun shared experience from childhood carried into adulthood. I love seeing that for my kids. Kids really love rereading, and audiobooks are great for revisiting favorite stories that become part of who they are, especially when shared with siblings.
Ela Bass (12:23)
I want to touch on your homeschool journey. You were homeschooled—why did you decide to homeschool your children?
Janssen Bradshaw (12:47)
We've done all variations over 10 years. My oldest went part-time to kindergarten—we'd homeschool mornings, she'd go afternoons. At Christmas, she didn't want to go anymore, so we finished the year homeschooling entirely. We did first grade homeschooling.
In second grade, I'd just had my fourth baby, my business was picking up, I felt underwater. We had a good STEM school in our open enrollment district, so she went there for second and third grade—really great experience. Then we moved out of state and all my kids went to public school.
In sixth grade, my oldest was ahead in math. Her teacher suggested an online math class she could do at the back of the classroom. After a few weeks, my daughter asked to do math at home because the timing wasn't syncing well. We got permission for her to go part of the day.
That opened the door to other options. She went part-time in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, and now in 10th grade still goes part-time.
Two years ago, we lived in a neighborhood with many homeschool families. Over summer lunch, my kids asked, "Could we homeschool next year?" My husband and I felt we had bandwidth—I didn't have tiny babies, my business was more controlled. We're now in the second year and it's been a great fit.
One thing I love about homeschool, which my mom was good about: what you choose now doesn't have to be forever. Right now homeschool might seem like something you want but have no capacity for. You can make different decisions later. Or if you homeschool, you don't have to forever. What's right for one child might not be right for others.
I didn't graduate from high school—I went part-time, didn't get a diploma, took the ACT, went to college and grad school. Not a problem. But all my siblings went full-time and graduated. My mom didn't have an agenda. It was always what's the best fit for you right now, and that can change. I try to have that for our kids too.
Ela Bass (17:57)
What have your kids gotten from these different experiences?
Janssen Bradshaw (18:26)
The biggest thing is ownership of their education. When I was being homeschooled at 40, it was very fringe. Everybody went to the local public school—kindergarten through 12th grade, not much variation.
Now there are so many options. My kids can look around and say, what do I want out of school? What's valuable to me? Whatever you choose will be a lot of work, but we can find an option that's really good for you and pushes you where you are.
My husband and I discuss this constantly. Many people get to college and struggle because it's been lockstep the whole way. Suddenly they have to make decisions—pick a major, decide what to study, what they care about, what they want after school.
I love for my kids to practice making those decisions at a lower level. What do I want to learn this year in fifth or sixth grade? How hard am I going on this language? What AP tests? What careers to explore as a sophomore? So it's not jarring when they get to college with more decision-making control.
Ela Bass (20:18)
How did they become like that? What questions did you ask early on?
Janssen Bradshaw (21:01)
Much is our general family culture. My husband and I both have non-traditional jobs, we've done many things, moved many places. This is the 15th house we've lived in over 20 years of marriage. My husband isn't afraid of change. My job on social media—such a quick-changing landscape—has given me practice.
They see that. As we move, how do we make new friends? Explore new libraries? Learn what's cool about this place? Make it feel like home? That's part of our family culture.
When we talk about homeschool, it's not "the world is your oyster, pick anything." It's "we're doing science—what would you like to learn about in science?" Not "let's not do science." We're doing history—this is what we did last year, what would you like to change?
I have framework, but they have say within that framework. It's not "you're six, tell me your ideal curriculum"—too overwhelming. But they can have say in what interests them.
Just this week, two of my girls were interested in American Sign Language. A neighbor mentioned their niece is deaf and they're learning some sign language. My kids watched YouTube videos, got on the library website, requested books, and asked, "Can you take us to the library after dinner to pick these up? We want to practice more."
That's exactly what I want—for them to feel they have resources and understanding of how to learn more about interests, how to chase down interests. Their understanding that books are a great way to get knowledge to answer questions is part of their fundamental understanding of the world.
Ela Bass (23:27)
It sounds like you read together openly. Your kids grew up watching and benefiting from your love of reading.
Janssen Bradshaw (23:49)
Yes.
Ela Bass (23:54)
What does a day in the life look like now?
Janssen Bradshaw (24:30)
Because my kids are older, they have lots of autonomy. They have charts of things they do every day.
Early morning, they have scheduled classes—Mandarin tutoring because we were in a Mandarin immersion school. When we started homeschooling, I wanted them to keep up their immersion language, so they have a tutor over Zoom. My daughter has Savvy reading and math classes.
Then they have a block of time to figure out what they want to do—what order. When am I doing poetry? Typing practice? It's open-ended time to do things in any order they want, being the driver.
We finish with geography every other day with my husband or history with me, then family reading. So scheduled online things in the morning, free homeschool stuff, then family stuff to end the day.
Ela Bass (25:55)
Was that something you figured out works for your family, or something your mom did?
Janssen Bradshaw (26:12)
We did similar things growing up—"here are things you need to get done, but you drive when and how." Then "here are times I'll work with you."
That also works well because when they're doing their own things, I can work. I work from home, and I work a lot in the afternoon when they're done with school.
Ela Bass (26:37)
You mentioned Savvy, available in the OpenEd marketplace. Why did you start Savvy?
Janssen Bradshaw (26:56)
My oldest daughter learned to read early and well. In kindergarten, she tested at 12th grade reading level. She picked it up really easily. I assumed that's how it would be for all my kids.
My second daughter struggled a lot. I started working with her at two or three on letters and sounds, same as my oldest. It wasn't clicking. I thought, do I need to be worried? Is this too early? Is this normal? It's hard to tell when your other child was so far ahead.
In first grade, halfway through, her teacher said at parent-teacher conference, "She's barely at grade level, the very lowest we can call grade level. She's drifting farther down every time. At this trajectory, by year's end, she'll be quite a bit behind."
If you know about reading, those are crucial years. If you get to end of third grade and aren't a competent reader, most kids never catch up. The first couple years are "learn to read," then it's "read to learn." I thought, yikes.
Okay, someone who looks at lots of kids and knows benchmarks is saying there's a problem. That was a slap in the face—if we don't change something, this will become bigger.
I was already seeing that. My second daughter is extremely bright. It wasn't that she wasn't smart. Learning to read is just really hard for some kids. For her, it was difficult, making her feel dumb, which wasn't true. She was starting to disengage from school because it was hard.
The teacher recommended she work with a tutor—actually just an intern, a college student. She'd come in one-on-one for a bit each day. Within weeks, we saw major progress with individualized help.
Then COVID hit, everything shut down. The second week, the teacher emailed saying the intern still wanted hours and could do the same thing online.
My daughter was resistant to working with me or my husband—she'd get frustrated easily. But she'd get on with this young intern, maybe 19 or 22—this was not engaging or exciting, just a white screen with black words, practicing words. She'd get on with no complaint.
That summer at my parents', she was swimming. I said, "Come in, time to do this." She just got out of the pool and got on with her, no resistance. She was making so much progress so quickly.
I mentioned this online on Instagram—that we were doing this and she was making progress. People said, "Can you put me in contact with her? Would she take other students?" I said, this is so low level, I can't tell you how not exciting this is.
But as my husband and I saw what great progress she was making with someone not us—15 to 20 minutes a day, so consistent—she was making huge strides. We thought, there's something here and people are interested.
There's a guy my husband worked with at Intel. His wife was a reading instructor. During COVID she'd been helping neighborhood kids with reading. Jeremy, the husband, thought they could scale this. Both husbands were having similar experiences.
They'd get on calls every couple months to discuss startups and what seemed interesting. Jeremy said, "Amy's onto something. She has a master's, she's in teaching reading. If we could make this available to more kids." My husband said, "Actually, I have a vision because we're seeing these 20-25 minute classes with personalized instruction right at your level."
We started working on that in June 2020 and launched fall 2020. Within months. I got on my blog and Instagram saying, "We're launching this program, opening pre-sales." We thought if we get 10 people to sign up, it's probably worth doing. If 20 people, we're really in business.
We had more than 100 people sign up. We've done lots of businesses—most don't take off like that. We thought, whoa, there's real interest. Within weeks of launching, we got rave reviews like, "My kid cried and screamed about any reading practice, but they get on Savvy and love it. They're making progress, picking up books on their own for the first time, saying this is fun."
It was magical—we realized there's really something here. We've been running Savvy five years now. We have Savvy Math also. We've expanded grades.
I get lots of feedback, but no messages are like Savvy messages where people say, "This changed my child's life."
If you cannot read, all of school—you feel stupid, behind, like school isn't for you. You disengage. When you start feeling "I can do this, I can learn this"—that's life changing. To be part of that has been so special.
We saw that with our own daughter. A couple years ago, someone asked, "Does this embarrass your daughter for you to talk about her hard time reading?" I asked her—she was in fourth grade, eight or nine—"Is this embarrassing? Are you okay with me sharing this?"
She said, "Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."
That is what you want. Not that something hard crushes you, but you run into something hard and conquer it. It's one thing for a parent or teacher to say, "You're smart, you can do hard things." It's another for a child to know "This was really hard and I fully conquered it."
In fifth grade, she tested at 11th grade reading level. This isn't me telling her how smart she is. She knows 100% with certainty and proof she can do hard things. If things are hard, that doesn't mean she gives up or can never get good at it. She has more confidence than she'd have without that challenge.
To see that not just for her but for thousands and thousands of other kids—I mean, it's been so cool. I feel so lucky.
Ela Bass (36:04)
So rewarding.
Janssen Bradshaw (36:06)
Really is. What could I be doing that makes more difference than this, that affects the trajectory of your whole life?
Ela Bass (36:14)
So interesting and beautiful that you started with books, loved books, then had a daughter who struggled with reading, and now you build this company. Very full circle—you help her do what you love. It's so aligned with who you are.
What makes Savvy so good for students? What makes it different? This is usually one of those challenges—math and reading are the two areas where it's like, I just cannot get through this. What about Savvy breaks through?
Janssen Bradshaw (37:14)
Number one thing about Savvy: it meets you where you are. That's hard in a class. No matter how good the teacher, if you have 25 or 30 kids, it's almost impossible to meet every kid where they are. Every kid is at a different level.
For Savvy, you're having reading or math instruction right where you are. Our goal is to hit that perfect mark—if it's too easy, it's boring, you're checked out. If it's too hard, you're also checked out, too frustrated, you give up.
You want it just at that spot with just enough challenge. Think of skiing. If you're a medium skier, you don't want the bunny hill—boring. But don't put me on a double black diamond—no chance, probably going to die. I want just the hill giving me just enough challenge to feel fun, pushing myself a little, but easy enough I can do it without getting really hurt or frustrated.
Savvy does that really well—meeting you exactly where you are, always in that flow where it's engaging and you want to keep doing it without tapping out because you're bored or frustrated. That's number one.
Two, it's so interactive. Kids love attention. Having a teacher there in real time talking to you and engaging—humans are wired for connection. Not "go do this whole thing on your own for 30 minutes and then we'll check in."
Third thing is consistency. We're all like this, right? I want to go to the gym and work out two hours every six months. You're not getting anywhere. To have this four days a week, 25-minute classes—long enough for great instruction, not so long you check out.
It's like going to the gym five days a week. You don't have to be there three hours, but 45 minutes four or five days a week, you're going to make good progress.
Those are the three secret sauces. As a parent, especially homeschooling with other kids, that consistency can be really challenging. We hear constantly from people like, "I've watched you talk about Savvy for four years. I keep thinking I can do it myself and keep not, and keep falling farther behind." It's hard to manage consistency on your own.
Savvy provides that in a great way. For many public school or charter school kids doing Savvy, but especially with homeschool, it gives your child consistency and gives you a chance to work with another child while one child does Savvy. You can break up and get help many homeschool parents need balancing lots of kids and needs.
Ela Bass (41:06)
I love the point you made earlier because there's one school of thought that if a kid doesn't read, they'll read eventually. But if you can help a kid—if it's not the kid bucking against every possible thing you're doing—it is helpful in teaching other subjects, right?
As a homeschooler, you have more flexibility than public school students. But I love the emphasis that reading is a tool, especially at a certain point.
The longer a kid does not read, you prolong them having that tool in their toolkit. Is it detrimental to who they could become? Maybe eventually they'll learn and speed up. But as many tools as we can give our kids as early on—that's the sentiment from many OpenEd parents. I just want to open as many doors for my kids as possible.
I love that you're helping kids do that because it's so true. Kids love people who love them. That's something I've seen, especially in the microschool movement—kids who didn't love school are starting to love school because their teachers actually care about them personally. It sounds like you have people who make kids feel special, actually want to be there, are really amazing teachers excited when a kid learns something.
From the receiving end, that's so different. What has been the most rewarding thing for you in this whole journey of reading, all these book recommendations you've been doing consistently for the past 20 years, and now building Savvy?
Janssen Bradshaw (43:30)
Reading is just so magical and gives you experiences and views into the world. Sometimes that's great literature—you're part of the Pride and Prejudice or Animal Farm club. Sometimes it's just a fluffy romance reminding you of the sheer joy of getting lost in someone else's life. It can be that whole spectrum.
For Savvy, it's opening that world for kids where they get to experience that. For Everyday Reading, what I love most is when I get messages from people like, "I was a huge bookworm growing up" or "I never read growing up and now I'm 37 and I've just read 10 books this year and I haven't read a book for fun in 25 years."
Either they rediscover that part of them or for the first time get the door opened into the world. If I get a chance to open that door, whether they've been there before or not, is really magical. It's like you've given someone a whole new world to live in and I feel really lucky to get to do that.
Ela Bass (44:49)
That's beautiful. Many OpenEd marketplace parents have lots of options, which can be stifling at times. For reading help, there are 10 different providers. What makes Savvy Learning so good and who do you think it's most for?
Janssen Bradshaw (45:09)
Savvy works really well for three kinds of students. One is a struggling student who's like, "I hate it, I hate reading, I hate books, I hate math." For them to start having positive experiences is life changing. In a way that doesn't make them feel "I'm not smart, I'm behind." It's like, you are where you are.
Like I took up skiing. We moved to Utah. I hadn't grown up skiing at all. I thought, okay, if we're living in Utah, I better learn. None of the instructors were like, "I can't believe you're 35 and don't know how to ski." They're like, "Great. You're ready to learn, we're going to meet you where you are."
Savvy is great for that. If you're on a poor trajectory where you hate reading, hate books, hate math—that can change the trajectory.
Child number two that Savvy Reading works well for: kids that are competent but don't love reading. They can do it, they're fine, at grade level. The teacher says yes, fine. They're not struggling necessarily, but Savvy helps them discover a love of reading—making it fun and engaging.
I love seeing parents who say, "It was hard to decide if I wanted to do Savvy because they weren't so obviously..." If your child is nine and can barely read three-letter words, you know there's a problem. Less easy to see there's a problem if your child's basically on grade level but just kind of meh.
To circle back to what we said earlier about homeschool, one of my biggest goals is for kids to have a love of learning and to want to learn. Humans are wired to learn. Savvy really can help kids suddenly discover, "This is interesting, this is fun, this is engaging." Even if I knew basic fundamentals, now I can do it.
Third one is kids way ahead. Especially if you're in public school and checked out a little at school in reading or math—you're way ahead, bored by all this. Savvy can meet those kids where they are.
My second daughter was struggling, so Savvy helped her pull up from the bottom. My third daughter was very advanced in reading and math. She did Savvy while in public school. It gave her a challenge she wasn't having in public school—at her level, moving at a much faster, higher pace. For a child anxious to learn and loves learning, to have that fun engaging experience at their level instead of waiting all the time or like yeah, I know that—that's a great experience too.
Those are the three things. As a fourth one—we hear a lot from kids who are competent readers. Show them words and they can read it, but they struggle with comprehension. What was that about? I have no idea. I can't answer questions.
Savvy especially, about third through sixth grade levels, is very focused on comprehension. What good is it if you can read words on the page but can't make meaning out of them? I could read words in Italian because it uses the same alphabet. I could say those words, but they'd mean nothing to me. Savvy is really great for kids who need comprehension help too.
Ela Bass (49:14)
I've loved everything you've said. I'm going to hit you with a couple rapid fire questions. Then maybe we can do a part two.
Rapid fire number one: what is one reading habit you'd recommend for all OpenEd families?
Janssen Bradshaw (49:31)
Audiobooks. I feel like they're magical. You said rapid fire, I'm giving a long answer.
The best thing we did for my second daughter when struggling with reading: reading was hard for her, but she still loved books and stories. She had very high comprehension. She listened to tons of audiobooks. Even though she couldn't read words on the page well, she could listen and follow much more complicated stories.
When she did start getting reading help she needed, first with the individual intern then through Savvy, she could put those parts together pretty quickly because she understood fundamentals of how stories, words, and vocabulary work.
My kids listen to—we listen to audiobooks in the car as a family on road trips or just going to the grocery store. They listen at night and during the day while doing other projects. Audiobooks are such an underutilized tool that teach so many good reading skills that help with the actual mechanics of reading with your eyes on a page.
Ela Bass (50:45)
I love that recommendation. Second question: what is your current favorite series? I'm thinking about good gifts this season.
Janssen Bradshaw (51:21)
For 2025 reading for me, it's the Unselected Journals of Emma M. Lyon. Have you heard of these?
Ela Bass (51:28)
I have not.
Janssen Bradshaw (51:33)
They kind of have a Pride and Prejudice meets Anne of Green Gables meets Little Women feel, but they're new. An adult series, but my 12 and 15-year-olds are super into them, my 10-year-old's listened to quite a few, my husband's listened.
It's about this young woman who lives in London, an orphan, just ridiculous things in her life. 1880s London. It's witty, fun, has romance. Fully delightful. Slow start, especially on paper. Audiobooks are easier to get into. Took me a couple books to get into, but many people said, "This is the best series I've ever read." I thought, okay, I gotta keep going.
Then I finished it and went back and read the whole series again. Now I'm listening to the whole series again. Really fun.
Ela Bass (52:20)
Good to know. I know everybody's asking what are the best recommendations for gifts right now. Your Instagram is full of them. If families need more recommendations, go check that out.
Last rapid fire question: keeping up with reading as a busy mom is very difficult. What's your best recommendation?
Janssen Bradshaw (52:43)
One, same as the first question: audiobooks. I love audiobooks. They're a great way to engage with books when you don't have time to sit down.
I also am a huge Kindle lover. Being able to take a book on the go and pick it up anytime, get library books delivered in three seconds, really has helped my reading life.
Third suggestion: put your phone to bed in a different room if you can. I put my phone to bed in my office. Once I go into my bedroom at night, I'm not distracted by it. I can pick up my book. If my phone was sitting there—ask me how I know because I did this for 10 years—I read one page and think, I wonder if anything interesting happened on Instagram. I should text that, I should check that thing on Google. Having my phone in a different room in the evening is very helpful.
Ela Bass (53:34)
Great recommendation. Something I've been doing too is I got one of those bricks. I'll go to my phone and everything's locked and I'm like, oh my gosh, okay, I might as well read.
This has been amazing. Where can people find you if they want to learn more?
Janssen Bradshaw (53:57)
My Instagram is Everyday Reading and my blog is Everyday-Reading.com. Those are the two main places and I love talking about books. It's the dream job to connect with people all the time who want to ask, what series should I try out or how can I fit in more reading? Those are things I want to talk about all the time.
Ela Bass (54:20)
That's amazing. If you're an OpenEd family or not, definitely check out Savvy Learning. We'll link it in the description. It's an amazing tool. We've loved it and offering it to families. Tons of families have given us great feedback. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Hopefully we can do it again sometime.
Janssen Bradshaw (54:42)
Perfect, thanks for having me, this was so fun.

Janssen Bradshaw had every advantage a parent could want when it comes to raising readers.

She grew up in a home where her mom - an English major - read aloud every single day. Even in high school, they'd sit together with two copies of *Pride and Prejudice*, taking turns page by page. Janssen became an elementary school librarian. She started [Everyday Reading](https://everyday-reading.com/), a blog and [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/everydayreading) dedicated to books. Her house has somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books in it.

When her first daughter tested at a 12th-grade reading level in kindergarten, Janssen figured this is just what happens when you surround kids with books from birth.

Then came her second daughter.

"I started working with her when she was like three - her letters, her sounds, all the same things I'd done with my oldest child," Janssen told me. "And it was just not clicking for her."

She kept at it. Same methods. Same environment. Same read-alouds and library trips and books everywhere. But by first grade, a teacher delivered the news at a parent-teacher conference: her daughter was barely at grade level - the very lowest they could call "at grade level" - and she was drifting lower with each assessment.

Same mom. Same books. Completely opposite outcomes.

"My second daughter is extremely bright," Janssen said. "It was not like she was not smart. But learning to read is just really hard for some kids. And for her, it was really difficult."

## Why Early Reading Struggles Matter So Much

If you're watching your child struggle with reading, you probably already sense that time matters. The research confirms it.

The shift happens around third grade. Before that, kids are "learning to read" - decoding words, building fluency, making the connection between sounds and symbols. After third grade, they're "reading to learn" - using reading as a tool to absorb everything else. History. Science. Math word problems. Instructions.

"If you get to third grade and you are not a competent reader, most kids never catch up after that," Janssen explained. "Because now you're not teaching reading, you're teaching everything else assuming you can read the assignments."

The [National Assessment of Educational Progress](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/) puts hard numbers on this: 66% of fourth graders read below proficiency level. And research consistently shows that roughly 70% of struggling readers who don't get effective intervention never catch up.

But what the statistics don't capture is how reading struggles become *identity* struggles.

Janssen watched it happen with her daughter. "That was making her feel like she was dumb, which was not true. It made her feel like she didn't like school. She was starting to disengage with school because it was hard for her."

A kid who can't read doesn't just fall behind academically. They start to believe something is wrong with them.

## Signs Your Child May Need Help

So what should parents actually watch for? Not vague "they're struggling" - but specific, observable patterns.

**Decoding difficulties:** They struggle to break apart longer words. They don't recognize the same word when it appears again a few sentences later. They guess at word endings instead of sounding them out.

**Comprehension gaps:** They can't remember or retell what they just read, even if they technically got through all the words.

**Avoidance and resistance:** "I hate reading." Meltdowns when it's time to practice. Elaborate strategies to get out of anything involving books.

**The bright-but-struggling pattern:** This was Janssen's daughter exactly. Sharp in conversation. Quick to understand concepts when they're explained verbally. But something wasn't connecting on the page.

If you're seeing these patterns, the answer is rarely "try harder." Something else is going on - and with the right help, it can change.

## Why 60-Minute Tutoring Sessions Don't Work

When parents see their child struggling, the natural instinct is more help. More time. More practice. And often, that means traditional tutoring: hour-long sessions, once or twice a week.

[Tony Mickelsen, CMO of Savvy Learning, puts it bluntly](https://youtu.be/6JOzVZEQ0Zk?si=06q_ggPeV5hlM_Af): "What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult."

Most parents are putting in plenty of effort. They just need a different approach.

In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published research that became known as the "[Two Sigma Problem](https://opened.co/blog/einstein-had-a-tutor)." He found that students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than students in conventional classrooms - meaning the average tutored student outperformed 98% of classroom-taught students.

We've known for 40 years that personalized instruction dramatically outperforms the standard model. Yet we've built most of our educational infrastructure around approaches that work for maybe half of kids.

There's another factor Janssen discovered firsthand: the parent problem.

Her daughter would resist and fight when mom or dad tried to practice reading with her. The emotional stakes were too high. She didn't want to disappoint them. She felt the pressure differently.

But when a college intern - not a parent, not a teacher with a classroom full of other kids - started working with her one-on-one at school, something shifted. Within weeks, Janssen was seeing major progress.

Then COVID hit and everything shut down.

## What 25-Minute Sessions Can Do

The school's reading tutor - actually just a college student doing an internship - reached out to Janssen. She wanted to finish her hours. Would Janssen's daughter be willing to continue working together online?

What happened next surprised Janssen.

"This was like a white screen with black words on it," she said. "'Let's just practice words.' That's it."

Nothing fancy. No gamification. No elaborate curriculum. Just consistent, focused, one-on-one practice.

And her daughter would get out of the pool - without complaint - to get on that Zoom call.

"I remember that summer we went down to visit my parents and she was swimming and I said, 'Come on in, it's time for you to do this.' And she just got out of the pool and got on with her and she just put up no resistance."

What made it work? A few things came together:

**Frequency over duration.** Short sessions - 20 to 25 minutes - multiple times per week. Think of it like exercise: four 30-minute gym sessions beat one two-hour marathon. Kids stay engaged instead of burning out. Progress compounds instead of resetting.

**Consistency builds momentum.** Harvard economist Roland Fryer's research on high-dosage tutoring found that it's not about total hours - it's about frequency and engagement. 130+ hours delivered in small, consistent doses outperforms sporadic longer sessions.

**The not-parent factor.** Someone outside the family dynamic. Lower emotional stakes. A relationship built purely around this one thing.

**Structured literacy approach.** Systematic, explicit phonics instruction - often called Orton-Gillingham based methods - that builds skills sequentially rather than expecting kids to just "pick it up."

Tony Mickelsen describes what happens at the end of a well-designed 25-minute session: "The kids are hyped. They want to come back."

That experience - Janssen watching her daughter transform through consistent, personalized, short-burst instruction - eventually became [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/), the company she co-founded with her husband and another couple. They launched in fall 2020, hoping for 10 sign-ups. They got over 100.

## From Barely at Grade Level to 11th Grade Reading

So what happened to Janssen's daughter?

She went from barely at grade level in first grade - drifting lower with each assessment - to testing at an 11th-grade reading level by fifth grade.

Years later, someone asked Janssen if her daughter was embarrassed that she talks publicly about those early struggles.

So Janssen asked her directly. Her daughter was eight or nine at the time.

"Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me?" she said. "And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

Janssen's reflection: "It's one thing for your parent or your teacher to be like, 'You're smart, you can do hard things.' It is another thing for a child to know: this was really hard for me and I fully conquered it."

The struggle wasn't a setback. It became proof.

One more thing helped during those difficult years: audiobooks. Janssen's daughter still loved stories - she just couldn't decode them herself yet. Audiobooks kept her engaged with books, kept her vocabulary growing, kept her comprehension developing even while they worked on the mechanics.

"When she did start getting the reading help she needed, she could put those parts together pretty quickly," Janssen said. "Because she understood the fundamentals of how stories and words and vocabulary all work."

Don't underestimate the value of keeping a struggling reader connected to the joy of stories, even through a different medium.

## How to Help a Struggling Reader

If you're seeing the signs - the resistance, the frustration, the bright kid who just isn't clicking with reading - here's where to start:

**Get a baseline.** Know where your child actually stands. [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) offers a free 15-minute reading assessment that shows exactly where kids are and what they need. It's a starting point, not a sales pitch - you'll get actionable information either way.

**Think frequency over duration.** If you're considering tutoring, look for programs that meet three to four times per week in focused, shorter sessions. The research is clear: this outperforms occasional longer sessions.

**Give yourself permission to get outside help.** Sometimes the best thing a parent can do is not be the teacher for this particular skill. That's not failure. That's strategy. Janssen had 5,000 books and a background as a school librarian - and her daughter still needed someone else.
