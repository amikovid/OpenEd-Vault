# The Open Education Journey: Crafting a Custom Path for Every Child

## One Size Fits One: The End of the Educational Assembly Line

For generations, we have accepted a fundamental falsehood: that education is a linear path, a standardized product delivered on an assembly line. We group children by manufacture date (grade level), process them through a uniform curriculum, and expect a consistent outcome. But as any parent knows, children are not standard.

The modern education landscape is no longer a binary choice between public and private. It is a vibrant, sprawling ecosystem of options. The question is no longer *which* single path to choose, but *how* to artfully combine the best of all paths.

This is the core of the **Open Education mindset**: viewing education not as a pre-packaged product, but as a dynamic, evolving journey that is custom-built for the individual child.

## The Architect Parent: From Consumer to Creator

In the Open Education model, the parent's role shifts from a passive consumer to an active **architect** of their child's learning. This doesn't mean you have to teach every subject, but it does mean you are empowered to curate the best possible combination of resources.

As the authors of *Open Education* discovered through their own families:

> "We raised our children in the same home with the same routines and same expectations... yet it was clear that each child had their own unique set of needs and wants. If two parents raising five children in the same way resulted in very different pathways for each child, how could a standardized public education system offer a personalized learning journey for millions of children? Spoiler alert: It can’t, at least not alone."
\- Matt Bowman, Open Education
> 

The journey of an Open Education family is one of constant adaptation, of mixing and matching to meet the needs of the moment.

## The "Mix-and-Match" Philosophy in Action

What does this look like in practice? It looks like the freedom to be flexible. It's the story of a girl who isn't just "homeschooled," but who:

- Plays volleyball and takes a science class at the **local public school**.
- Takes online courses from a **virtual charter school**.
- Participates in a weekly **homeschool co-op**.
- Works with a **private tutor** for math.
- "Unschooled" on Fridays, following her own interests in the **real world**.

This is not an edge case; it is the future of learning. It is a journey that requires humility and a willingness to evolve, as author Isaac Morehouse shares:

> "Over the years, we had them in homeschool tutorials and co-ops, various at-home and online curricula, a twice-a-week microschool, a part-time Waldorf school, and every variation in between. Our oldest wanted to go to a public high school one year, so we let him. He decided not to go back the next year and instead to work full time, so we let him... The real lesson is that it’s not about us, the parents. It’s not about what I think sounds good or makes me look good. It’s about what best helps my kids."

## The Path Forward: From Unbundling to Rebundling

We are living through the **Great Education Unbundling**. The monolithic institution of "school" is being broken down into its component parts: courses, experiences, mentorships, and communities.

The next great innovation is in the **rebundling**. The Open Education mindset empowers parents to become master rebundlers, creating coherent, personalized pathways from this rich marketplace of options. It's about moving from "school choice" to "course choice" and ultimately to "experience choice."

This is a call to embrace the role of educational designer. It is permission to trust your instincts, to listen to your child, and to have the courage to adapt their learning journey as they grow and change. The tools are available, the options are expanding, and the path is yours to create.

Based on the resources in your workspace, I've compiled information about mixing and matching educational options, à la carte education, and the unbundling of education to help with your creative brief or strategic narrative.

## The Concept of Educational Unbundling

Educational unbundling refers to the shift away from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to education toward more personalized, mix-and-match educational options. Michael B. Horn, a prominent education innovator, describes this as part of a larger trend in which families can combine different educational resources rather than accepting rigid, pre-packaged systems.

The core idea is that no single institution can meet every need of every child, and families should be able to customize education by combining resources in ways that work for individual learners.

## Key Terminology and Concepts

- **Unbundling vs. Traditional Vouchers**: Unlike traditional vouchers that simply pay for private school tuition, Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) allow families to use funds for a variety of educational services and customize their children's education.
- **À La Carte Education**: This approach allows families to select specific educational components from different providers, similar to ordering individual items from a menu rather than accepting a pre-set meal.
- **Customization**: Parents are becoming "education designers" who craft personalized learning experiences by combining different resources based on their children's specific needs and interests.

## Evolution of Educational Choice

The movement toward unbundled education has evolved through several phases:

1. **Traditional School Choice Movement**: Initially focused solely on private school tuition through vouchers with limited eligibility.
2. **Charter Schools & Independent Study Programs**: These laid groundwork for more flexible models with public funding following students.
3. **Pandemic as Catalyst**: COVID-19 accelerated experimentation with hybrid models, revealing the possibilities beyond traditional classrooms.
4. **Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)**: Now available in at least 14-19 states, these programs provide families with funds they can use across multiple providers.

## Real-World Examples

The workspace includes several examples of educational unbundling in practice:

- **Student Hybrid Models**: One student described herself as "a homeschooler enrolled in OpenEd (which partners with a public school), split-enrolled in my local school for band class, and pursuing a competency-based associate degree".
- **Utah's Experience**: While most states see about 90% of ESA funds going to private school tuition, Utah is different - projections showed nearly 50% of families planned to customize their children's education rather than simply paying tuition to a single provider.
- **Vail School District (Arizona)**: Created a rate card for individual course purchases, allowing families to buy core academic classes, electives, sports participation, club access, and extracurricular programs while maintaining their primary educational approach elsewhere.

## Common Customization Models

Several customization patterns are emerging:

- **Traditional Public School Plus**: Morning at neighborhood school, afternoon enrichment programs, supplemental online courses.
- **Hybrid/Flex Model**: Part-time microschool, virtual academy for core subjects, community college dual enrollment.
- **Full Customization**: Parent-directed learning with multiple specialized providers and community-based activities.

## Available Resources

The "OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCE BUNDLE" document lists various resources families can mix and match:

- Community education classes
- Early college programs
- Community centers and parks
- Sports leagues and clubs
- Apprenticeships
- Family expertise and connections
- Online courses (Outschool, Coursera)
- Specialized camps
- Educational YouTube channels
- Local tutoring exchanges
- Private instruction
- Public school à la carte options
- Homeschool co-ops
- Microschools

## Challenges and Considerations

Despite growing interest, educational unbundling faces several challenges:

- **Adoption Curve**: Horn cautions that unbundling won't happen en masse or immediately. Families need time to understand options and get comfortable with customization.
- **Transaction Costs**: There are still significant transaction costs associated with piecing together a customized education plan, making it daunting for many families.
- **Market Development**: The marketplace isn't fully developed yet, with most state ESA programs being centrally administered with limited user-friendliness.

## Future Directions

The resources point to several emerging trends:

- **Public Schools Adapting**: Some districts are beginning to offer à la carte enrollment through ESA marketplace participation, letting families build custom combinations of public school offerings.
- **Education Marketplaces**: The development of robust marketplaces with multiple providers, flexible funding models, and parent navigation support.
- **Policy Evolution**: Policy changes that could enable a coherent rebundled future of learning, including eliminating seat time requirements in favor of mastery demonstration.

This information should provide a solid foundation for your creative brief or strategic narrative on the concept of unbundling education and the à la carte approach to learning.
