# Project Context for OpenEd Content Creation

### Project Overview

We're creating SEO-optimized hub-and-spoke content for OpenEd, a program that provides educational funding and support to families pursuing personalized learning approaches. The content consists of:

- A central hub page explaining "What is Open Education?"
- Spoke pages for different educational approaches (Montessori, Classical, Charlotte Mason, etc.)
- Deep-dive blog posts on curricula and resources for each approach

### Key Brand Elements

**OpenEd's Mission:** Making personalized education accessible to all families through funding partnerships with public schools. Families can get reimbursement for secular educational materials, tutors, co-ops, and programs.

**Target Audience:** Families already pursuing or interested in alternative education approaches who want funding support and community. We're NOT trying to convince people to leave traditional school, but supporting those who've already made that choice.

**Core Messaging:**

- Open education means mixing and matching approaches to fit your unique child
- You don't have to choose one educational philosophy and stick with it forever
- Educational materials and programs that seem expensive become accessible through OpenEd funding
- All secular curricula and materials are 100% reimbursable
- Avoid mentioning specific dollar amounts (funding varies by state)

### Writing Style Guidelines

**Tone:**

- Warm, knowledgeable, but not preachy
- Assume intelligence - parents researching education are sophisticated consumers
- Balance inspiration with practical information
- Use specific examples and stories to illustrate points

**Structure Patterns:**

- Open with compelling historical story or moment (1-2 paragraphs)
- Connect historical approach to modern context
- Show compatibility with open education philosophy
- Provide practical resources and next steps
- Close with empowering CTA

**Style Rules (from OpenEd Style Guide):**

- NEVER use "X aren't just Y — they're Z" construction
- Avoid "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- Don't use "The truth is..." or "The reality is..."
- Never write "Let that sink in"
- Keep sentences concise - remove surplus words
- Be specific and concrete rather than vague
- Write conversations, not speeches

### SEO Requirements

**Page Structure:**

- Target length: ~1500 words for spoke pages
- Use keyword-rich H2 headers that target search queries
- Include all required sections from SEO briefs
- Link between related pages in the hub-and-spoke system
- Meta titles should be under 60 characters

**For Spoke Pages (Montessori, Classical, etc.):**
Required sections:

- Defining [Approach] Education Method
- Benefits of [Approach]
- [Approach] with OpenEd
- [Approach] Education for Elementary School
- [Approach] Education for Middle School
- [Approach] Education for High School
- [Approach] Curriculum
- Custom CTA (not generic "OpenEd CTA")

**Resource Integration:**

- Hyperlink to actual programs/suppliers at first mention
- Include free, budget, and premium options
- Note which resources serve multiple children
- Always mention 100% reimbursability for secular materials

### Key Reminders

- OpenEd is the organization, open education is the philosophy/category
- Emphasize mixing approaches, not rigid adherence to one method
- Include practical resources with direct links
- Show how expensive materials become accessible through funding
- Address parents who already know the approach (not complete beginners)
- Connect each approach to open education principles
