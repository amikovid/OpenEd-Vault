# Podcast clip

Text: The content format is a podcast clip intended for multiple social media platforms, including IG Reels, YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and Pinterest. The posting cadence is set for two times a week, featuring one new clip and one recycled clip, scheduled for Wednesdays. The guidelines note that YouTube requires a title, while Facebook does not allow hashtags. Additionally, there is potential for repurposing with different captions, and the content may include a newsletter crossover focusing on a thought or trend.
