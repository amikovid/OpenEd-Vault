I’m a licensed teacher in the state of Colorado and graduated from the University of Colorado with a Bachelor’s Degree in Elementary Education and Master’s Degree in Curriculum & Instruction.

I live in Colorado with my husband and two children. Shortly after getting married and becoming pregnant with our first child, I was able to leave my full-time job as an educational coach and ESL teacher for PK-8th students to become a full-time mom and help homeschool my nieces.

As a teacher by trade, I naturally began teaching my children the basics prior to them becoming school age. I filled that teaching urge by offering local, homeschool group classes and coaching homeschool parents.

Fast forward to today—I’m excited to take my coaching online with the launch of my Homeschool Lifeline video courses.

I hope to be a guide by your side during this exciting adventure on which you’ve chosen to embark!
