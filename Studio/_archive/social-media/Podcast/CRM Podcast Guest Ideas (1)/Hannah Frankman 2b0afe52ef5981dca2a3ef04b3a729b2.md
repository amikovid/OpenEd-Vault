## Hannah Frankman’s posts

I got my first three jobs *because* I was homeschooled. All three of my first bosses told me “oh, we love homeschoolers.” Being homeschooled isn’t a hurdle you have to get over when you enter the real world. Often it’s actually a huge asset.

How come "education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire" is one of the most oft-referenced education quotes, and yet all we do is fill pails and quench fires?

This was *such* a fun interview. Jenny is a gem.

The whole US might share Amazon and Walmart and McDonalds and Netflix, but we definitely don’t share culture. At least not when it comes to marriage and families.

Quote

An interesting takeaway from 2 days in NYC. All the folks who live in the city can’t believe my wife and I have 3 children at 34 yrs old. Where I live in Georgia it is the opposite. People can’t believe when 34 year olds are single or married without kids. Cultural…

We’re largely creatures of cultural osmosis (we do what our community does), but we have rational thought and freedom of association. Choose your associated culture wisely.

Authors of "Kids Don't Need School", a radical new approach to homeschooling that builds the parent/child relationship, promotes agency, and independence.

If we all have the same intellectual inputs (knowledge), we’re all going to have the same outputs (ideas). There are certain things it behooves everyone to know. But after a point, too much intellectual homogeny (of the schooling variety) narrows the range of creative outputs.

I stopped drinking when I turned 25. Which is kind of melodramatic, because I barely ever drank before that. I didn’t like drinking. I only did it socially. I realized that was a bad reason, so I quit. I’m glad I did. From the outside, drinking is a strange social phenomenon.

I don’t hardcore “not drink.” I’ll try a taste of a friend’s drink. I’ll have a couple sips of something for a toast. I always tell people “It’s not like a rule, I’ll have a drink if I feel like it.” It’s been two and a half years since I’ve felt like it, though.

Mocktails, though. Mocktails are great. Stupidly overpriced if you get them at a bar. But delicious, and with all the fun tactile experiences of drinking (sensorily pleasing glass, complex flavor palette, interesting temperature experience, etc), but sans negatives.
