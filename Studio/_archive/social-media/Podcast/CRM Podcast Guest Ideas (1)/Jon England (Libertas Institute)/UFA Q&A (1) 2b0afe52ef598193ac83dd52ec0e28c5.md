# UFA Q&A (1)

- What is UFA?
- Can I enroll in MTH and UFA at the same time?
    
    Answer - no. However, you can still take MTH courses with your UFA dollars. You do have to withdraw however.
    
- What’s the status of the lawsuit against UFA?
    
    Likely does not pass constitutional muster - get someone from the IJ or Jon England to do a 2-minute clip.
    
- What can funds be used for?
- Can I still take classes at my local school district?/How does UFA impact my child's ability to participate in public school extracurriculars?

- What are the requirements for reporting how you use the funds or what your kids did in school? Are there weekly logs or an end of year portfolio?
- How can I get reimbursed?
- Interim education options until next year's application.

Since I have accepted the scholarship if I signed up for my tech high I don't want to be kicked out of the scholarship. What should I do? Any help I would truly appreciate!
- Do MTH (non-diploma seeking) parents have the legal right to issue a homeschool diploma and graduate their students?

Reporting Requirements

- What kind of reporting does UFA require from families?

Relationship between UFA and MTH

- Is MTH partnering with UFA?
- Can you use my tech high as well as the Utah fits all scholarship?
- Interim education options until next year's application.
- Why should I chose MTH over UFA?
    - Why are the UFA scholarships so much more money than what we can get through MTH and other alternative education options?

- Confusion about how MTH is a vendor for UFAS, as MTH was thought to be its own homeschool public school program.
- We love myTech High. It has been a great program for us over the years, and some aspects of the UFA scholarship are concerning for us. However, it's appealing to think of having more access to funds that would be allocated to our children that the scholarship would provide. I'd love to stick with myTechHigh in the long run, but my questions are as follows: 1. Would it be possible to increase the amount of MTH funding that goes directly to students such that it would be more competitive with the scholarship? 2. I find the idea of portfolios more appealing and meaningful than learning logs (box checking). Would MTH consider (is it even an option) to move toward that form of accountability in MTH? And a 3rd question: how come the scholarship seems to offer more flexibility as far as religious content (i.e. my understanding is that funds can be used to pay tuition to private schools which may or may not have religious curricula), but MTH still has to restrict funding certain materials because of religious content when the money comes from the same place (state legislature)? Is there a possibility that this could change?

Impact on 3rd Party Providers

- UFA is driving up the tuition fees of the 3rd party providers who were already charging under market value to match what MyTech High would cover. What will MyTechHigh do to help us keep the classes we've always been able to afford before?

Additional Scholarships & Funding

- Are there any other scholarships that we can access? Everything costs so much and we feel like we don't get enough to cover it.

Curriculum & Special Needs

- What is the best curriculum for a child with special needs?
- How can I utilize concurrent enrollment options in high school while homeschooling?
