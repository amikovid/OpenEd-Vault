This is the story of how she overcame fear, redefined learning, and found freedom in homeschooling.

**Ela:** Without COVID as the inflection point — that moment that forced you to ask, “Is this the best way for my kids to learn?” — do you think you would have ever considered homeschooling? What was that early process of learning about it like?

**Jamie:** Yeah, I was definitely very resistant to homeschooling — mostly because I just didn't feel like I was qualified.

I'm a teacher. I have that background. I know how to teach. But I still felt like I was not going to be able to meet my children's needs. They had amazing teachers at the charter school — specialists in every subject. I remember thinking, *there’s no way I can do all that.*

It was daunting. I just kept thinking, *How am I supposed to be the teacher for everything?*

So I started asking questions in our homeschool community. And what surprised me was how kind, knowledgeable, and welcoming everyone was. They said, “There’s so much more to learning than what the core standards dictate. There’s so much more about life than what’s in the textbooks.”

That opened my eyes. It’s hard to come out of the box when you think, *my kids have to do it this way because that’s how I did it.*

But the more I explored, the more I realized how much freedom there is. How much variety. There’s no one way to do this.

And when you start thinking outside the 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. window, you realize just how much is available — in your community, your neighborhood, your family.

My husband started using open-and-go curriculum and engaging with the kids’ lessons. My neighbors would teach things they knew. It became this beautiful network.

And the best part? My kids started to enjoy learning again. They started taking responsibility — becoming *partners* in their education instead of just passengers.

We went from, *you will learn this,* to *what do you want to learn — and how?*

That changed everything. It shifted our entire perspective.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela:** Wow. What was that experience for your kids? You’re expanding your perspective — but what were *they* going through as you began introducing more homeschool ideals?

**Jamie:** Oh man, my son would be on the floor regularly melting down. He was not enjoying all the expectations.

But you have to understand — I was trained to be a teacher. So I did what a lot of homeschool families warn against: I tried to *bring school home.*

We had a schedule, dedicated desks, planners — all these things I thought we needed. I wanted to make it as similar to school as possible.

It did *not* go well.

I have this picture — one of my favorites — of my three kids sitting on top of a little closet loft in our house doing their schoolwork together. They didn’t want to sit at desks. That’s where they chose to sit.

And I remember thinking, *Why do they have to learn at a desk? Why not let them learn here?*

That was one of the first moments where I realized — this is okay.

It’s okay that it doesn’t look normal.

It’s okay that my son wants to do math at 10:30 at night because that’s when his brain turns on. It’s okay that learning looks different for each of them.

That’s when the stress started melting away — for me and for them. That’s when learning actually started happening.

A wise and grounded reflection on what it takes to raise confident, capable kids in a self-directed environment.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela:** Say your kids come to you with something that’s not working — how do you handle it?

**Jamie:** It starts with listening. You have to put pride aside. You can’t say, “But this is what I created for you, it should work!” because it doesn’t always.

So I sit down and ask, *What’s not working? Why isn’t it working?* Sometimes, just talking it through helps them figure out the solution themselves.

I always tell them, “Let’s just try it and we’ll adjust from there.” That’s kind of our family motto.

And when they’re frustrated, I remind them — we give things two weeks. Try something for two weeks. If it’s not working, then we switch it up.

That’s what I learned from special education — test, adapt, repeat.

It’s about giving them ownership. Helping them learn to problem-solve.

We’ve also modeled real-world strategies — time management, accountability, taking responsibility for their own progress.

When something goes wrong, instead of yelling, I think, *Where did I not teach them? What can we do differently next time?*

We turn mistakes into learning moments. We reflect, adjust, and create new habits — together.

Because that’s what learning is all about. That’s what life is all about.
