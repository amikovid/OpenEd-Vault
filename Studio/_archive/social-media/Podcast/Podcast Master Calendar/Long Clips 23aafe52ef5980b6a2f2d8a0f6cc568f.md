### Title:

- “When You’re Afraid You’re Failing as a Parent”
- “Why Trying Is Enough”
- “The Hardest Part About Being Mom and Teacher”
- “What I Wish Every New Homeschool Parent Knew”

### Description:

In this tender, honest conversation, veteran homeschool mom **Sandy Grant** shares the message every parent needs to hear: *you won’t ruin your kids.* From fighting battles over curriculum to balancing love and discipline, she opens up about guilt, grace, and what it really takes to raise confident, capable kids at home.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela:** When do you fight your kids on those things? Like, when are you like, *Okay, I know you're being stubborn, but we have to do this,* versus recognizing that maybe they’re just not ready?

**Sandy:** It's really hard because you're not only their teacher — you're also their mom. And you have to deal with them all day long. You can’t send them home and make their parents do the homework. It's all on you.

And I tend to probably be a little light on it. I'm like, *this isn’t working, and it’s not worth fighting.* For the most part, I don’t like fighting with my kids. So if I can, I usually try to find an alternative that accomplishes the same task. If they’re not interested in a certain curriculum, I’ll say, *Okay, we still need to do language arts — but what option do you want?*

Giving them a little choice helps. Some of my kids would do whatever I asked. Others were like, *Good luck, Mom. I don’t want to learn.*

Each kid is different, and sometimes you have to put the relationship before your desire to have them meet every checkbox.

**Ela:** That’s an interesting note — putting your relationship before your role as teacher. I bet a lot of parents feel that.

**Sandy:** It’s hard. Because you’re with your kid all the time. You tuck them in at night and in your head you’re still thinking, *Why didn’t you do your math today? I’m trying to make this easy, and you’re making it hard.*

But you still want to be able to leave all that behind and say, *I love you, kid.* Even after a morning of fighting about checklists, you want them to know you love them.

That’s my number one thing: **just keep trying.** It’s not going to look picture-perfect — maybe someone out there has that homeschool family, but it wasn’t me. People say, *Oh, your kids are geniuses.* They’re not. I just kept trying.

You do your best, so at the end you can say, *I tried.* They may not all go to college — that might not be their path — but you gave them everything you could. And as long as you keep trying, **you will not ruin your kids.**

What happens when teaching your kids starts to strain your relationship with them? In this emotional exchange, Sandy Grant reflects on the delicate balance between being both mom and teacher — and why, at the end of the day, love has to come before lessons.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Sandy:** Each kid is different. And sometimes, you have to put the relationship before your desire to have them meet all your checkboxes.

**Ela:** That’s such an interesting note — the idea of parent before teacher.

**Sandy:** Yeah. Because you’re with your kid all the time. You’re tucking them into bed, thinking, *Why didn’t you do your math today?* You’re frustrated because you’re trying to make it easy on them, and they’re making it hard on you.

And yet you want to be able to leave all that behind — to just say, *I love you, kid.*

No matter how much you fought that morning, they need to know that love comes first.

It’s really just hard. You just have to keep trying. It’s not going to be perfect. Maybe someone out there has a perfect homeschool — but it wasn’t me.

People think my kids are geniuses. They’re not. They’re just loved.

That’s what keeps it all together.

## **Long Form 3 — “Let Them Lead: The Power of Self-Directed Learning”**

### Title:

- “Why I Only Plan Four Hours of School a Day”
- “The Secret to Raising Curious, Independent Kids”
- “How Free Time Became My Kids’ Best Teacher”
- “You Don’t Have to Fill Every Hour”
- “When You Stop Over-Scheduling, Real Learning Begins”

### Description:

Sandy Grant explains how letting her kids explore their own interests — from baking and coding to debate and theater — shaped their confidence and careers. A masterclass in trust, this segment shows how self-led learning turns curiosity into lifelong purpose.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela:** One of the things you mentioned in your guide was the idea of self-led interests — leaving time for curiosity, not just curriculum. How have you helped your kids develop that?

**Sandy:** I try to keep the required stuff simple — the core subjects, the checklists, the “have-to-dos.” I want them to have a broad foundation — basic history, biology, math, all that — but I don’t want their whole day filled with things *I* assign.

So I plan about four hours of school a day. They’re usually done by two or three, and the rest of the time is theirs. Whether or not they use it well — that’s up to them.

My son started coding in Scratch when he was ten. Now he’s a programmer. My daughter loved baking — she has a food blog now. Another got into community theater from a Shakespeare class I never thought she’d take. One built a debate prom from scratch because he thought his team deserved one.

They all found something because they had space.

I think it’s a good preparation for life. Adults have free time too — and if kids are constantly told what to do with every hour, they grow up not knowing how to fill it.

So I let them choose how to spend their afternoons. Sometimes it’s Minecraft videos, sometimes it’s baking or debate or reading. The point isn’t *what* they choose — it’s that they learn how to choose at all.
