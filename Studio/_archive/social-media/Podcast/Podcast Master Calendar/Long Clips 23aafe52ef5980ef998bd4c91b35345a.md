### Description:

In this powerful story, *Elle Tevebaugh* recalls the moment that sparked her family’s homeschooling journey — watching her kindergartner struggle through forced writing assignments, only to pour his heart into a spontaneous letter to a friend. What follows is an awakening about motivation, curiosity, and the true nature of learning.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** So you got started in homeschooling about four years ago, correct? Can you share kind of like that whole experience — how you got started, what was the initial inciting moment?

**Elle Tevebaugh:** Yeah, absolutely. My kids had just kind of fallen into the flow of public school. I had considered homeschooling but never pursued it, and they were struggling a bit in school.

And then those early COVID days happened. We were doing remote learning — I was trying to help my preschooler and kindergartner with online assignments. My older son, who’s now eleven, was in kindergarten — and he was absolutely miserable.

There was this assignment: they were supposed to write a few sentences each day about an animal and make their first “book.” We spent maybe two hours a day that week struggling and crying, and at best got one sentence written.

Then Friday came — no remote learning that day — and I asked him to write a letter to a friend who’d just moved away. He must have written maybe a hundred words in that letter. “Mom, how do I spell this?” “Can I say it this way?” He was *so* excited. In twenty minutes, he wrote more than he had all week — and he was proud of it.

That was the moment I realized: homeschooling might be better for us. He didn’t need more worksheets. He needed purpose.

I told his teacher, “I’ll keep reporting what we’re doing, but we’re not submitting these remote learning assignments anymore. I can’t keep doing this.”

That’s how it started — not from a grand plan, but from a moment of joy that showed me what learning could look like when it mattered to him.

## **Long Form 2 — “Becoming Their Best Teacher”**

### Title:

- “The Moment I Realized I’m the Best Teacher My Kids Will Ever Have”
- “How I Found Confidence After Failing at Homeschooling”
- “From Doubt to Trust: Learning to Believe I’m Enough”
- “Why I Took My Kids Out of School — Again”
- “What Every Parent Needs to Hear About Teaching Their Own Kids”

### Description:

After two years of homeschooling, doubt crept back in — so Elle put her kids in school again. What followed was an unexpected lesson: they started falling behind. In this deeply honest reflection, she shares how she finally accepted that *she* was her children’s best teacher — not because she was perfect, but because she knew them best.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** Coming to acceptance of “I am their best teacher” — how long did that take? And why have you settled on that now?

**Elle Tevebaugh:** Oh, I am so grateful that I have a partner who keeps reminding me: *You’re their best teacher.* Even when I doubt it.

After two years of homeschooling, we were starting our third year, and I panicked. I’d heard about this amazing project-based school — inclusive, creative, all the things I dreamed of. I thought, “Maybe that’s what we need.”

So we enrolled.

And honestly? They lost ground that year.

I’m not anti-school. I’m so grateful for teachers. But for *my* kids, for different reasons, it just didn’t work. By June, they knew *less* about their reading material than they had the August before.

They gained some things — friends, persistence — but academically, they slipped. I saw it with my own eyes.

That’s when it clicked: I *am* their best teacher. Not because I’m perfect — far from it — but because I know the tiny details. I know when one of them needs to run laps before coming back to math. I know the look in their eyes when they’re starting to shut down. No one else can give them that kind of attention.

And as parents, that’s what we bring — not expertise, but intimacy.

So now, even when it’s hard, even when I panic, I remember that year. And I remember what my husband said: “You’re the best teacher they’ll ever have.”

And I believe him now.

- “The Power of Play, Curiosity, and Dirt”
- “Why Wednesdays Are the Best Day of Our Week”
- “What My Kids Taught Me About Wonder”

### Description:

In this joyful and reflective segment, Elle describes how leading a *Nature Rangers* group reconnected her family — and herself — to the simple magic of learning outdoors. It’s a love letter to curiosity, friendship, and rediscovering wonder in the natural world.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** So can we talk about the different things you’re exploring with and for your kids — the passion-based types of learning? And how did Nature Rangers become part of that?

**Elle Tevebaugh:** Absolutely. And they really do go together.

In the Nature Rangers program I help teach, I get to see the ways kids *find joy* in learning again. We go on “science walks,” and they’re constantly asking questions: “What’s this plant?” “Did you know this?” They’re teaching me things — and each other.

There’s so much enthusiasm. They’re climbing, exploring, building friendships, and learning without realizing it. Some kids start off shy or disinterested — but a few weeks in, they’re leading lessons, explaining what they found.

For my family, it’s our best day of the week.

My kids come home glowing. They’ve been outside for five hours — building, laughing, learning science through play. And I’ve realized something else: it’s good for *me* too.

I loved being outside as a kid, but I had forgotten how peaceful it was — how grounding it is to touch the soil, to feel like part of something bigger. Science was always my worst subject, but now I love it.

Sometimes my students know more than I do about the local plants or birds — and they feel so proud teaching *me.*

That humility, that wonder — that’s what learning should feel like. And every time we’re out there, it reminds me: this is what education is meant to be.
