## **Long Form 1 — “How Columbine Changed Everything”**

### Title:

- “The Columbine Moment That Started It All”
- “How a School Tragedy Led Two Filmmakers to Rebuild Hope”
- “Why We Started Teaching Kids to Make Movies”
- “From Hollywood to the Classroom: The Story Behind Sneak On The Lot”
- “What Columbine Taught Me About Purpose and Creativity”

### Description:

After the Columbine tragedy, Hollywood filmmakers Darrin Fletcher and Chet Thomas felt compelled to act. They didn’t know how to stop violence — but they knew how to tell stories. This raw, powerful segment captures how grief turned into purpose, and how two artists built a film curriculum that’s changed thousands of students’ lives.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Karalee Sartin:** I feel like we’ve talked around the curriculum and about the curriculum, but Fletch, you mentioned in the beginning the origins of Sneak On The Lot — especially relating to Columbine. I want to dig into that just a little bit more. You obviously had busy lives and successful careers. Why would you take time out of that to create a curriculum? Why add one more thing to your life?

**Chet Thomas:** Who knows.

**Darrin Fletcher:** Part of it is because we’re stupid. We’re just always taking on more than we can do. But by doing it, a year later you look back and think — *hey, we did it. I can’t believe we pulled that off.*

When it first started, it was born out of this desire to make a difference. It was such a shock. I was driving down to set — I think I was working on *Touched By an Angel* — and I was listening to the Columbine shooting live on the radio.

And all I could think of was, *When did it become okay to bring a gun to school?* It was just so foreign to me.

Three days later, I went to my brother’s high school — he was a teacher — and I had his class write an essay. I said, “You can write a page as a cathartic exercise, or tell me honestly: how close are you to doing something like this? Is this insane to you, or is this in the realm of possibility?”

I still have those papers. There were sixty or seventy of them — and three or four said, *I’m pretty close.*

And it shocked me. These were my brother’s students. It hit me that there must be hundreds, thousands more like them.

That was the genesis — this realization that we *had* to do something. But all we knew how to do was make movies.

At first, that sounded pathetic — “You’re just filmmakers, entertainers.” But then we realized: making a movie uses every single classroom in a school.

You’ve got business classes doing budgets, art students doing design, music students scoring, science students helping with effects, history classes doing research, writers, actors — every kind of mind can contribute.

Once we saw that, we thought: *This could actually heal something.* Kids could express what they’re feeling in a nonviolent, creative way. So we started teaching filmmaking to students.

And I can’t tell you how many lives it changed. You’d see kids who were angry, withdrawn, or lost suddenly light up — because someone believed their story mattered.

That’s where Sneak On The Lot came from. It wasn’t about Hollywood. It was about giving kids back their voice — before the world convinces them they don’t have one.

## **Long Form 2 — “The Kind of Film Set That Changes Lives”**

### Title:

- “How to Run a Film Set Without Losing Your Soul”
- “Why We Chose Kindness Over Chaos”
- “What It Really Feels Like to Work With People You Love”
- “Making Movies Without the Ego”
- “A Different Kind of Hollywood Story”

### Description:

Film sets are famously stressful — high stakes, long hours, and short tempers. But Darrin Fletcher and Chet Thomas believe there’s another way. In this candid segment, they explain how they learned to lead with patience, joy, and purpose — building creative environments where everyone, from student to pro, can thrive.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Karalee Sartin:** You two have managed to create an atmosphere on set that’s focused but kind — where people feel lifted instead of burned out. How do you do that? And why?

**Darrin Fletcher:** Boy, good questions. You do get really close when you’re working on a film, because you’re with the same people twelve to eighteen hours a day, for months. It *can* feel like family — but you’re right, it’s stressful. It’s not ideal for bringing out the best in people.

Early on, Chet and I saw what *not* to do. When we were working on movies of the week — smaller budgets, tighter schedules — those were pressure cookers. I thought, *I don’t want to live my life like this.*

But every once in a while, you’d find a crew that worked *well* together. And you’d think, *This is it.* Everyone’s creative, no one’s afraid to speak, everyone brings their best. Those sets — they made you excited to go to work. That’s the kind of environment we wanted to create forever.

**Chet Thomas:** Yeah. Like you said, it’s a stressful world, and not everyone handles that well. Usually, you only work with those people once. Over the years, your crew gets better and better — more like family.

Life’s too short to create *more* stress when there’s already plenty. We’d rather have fun while getting it done — lifting others, building others. That’s what we try to bake into Sneak On The Lot: values that *build.*

We don’t just teach filmmaking. We teach how to be the kind of filmmaker people actually want to work with.

## **Long Form 3 — “Every Kid Belongs Somewhere”**

### Title:

- “How Film Helps Every Student Find Their Place”
- “There’s a Role for Everyone — On and Off the Set”
- “Why Filmmaking Brings Out the Best in Every Type of Kid”
- “From Math Nerds to Dreamers: How Movies Unite a School”
- “The Most Inclusive Classroom You’ve Never Seen”

### Description:

Film isn’t just about cameras and actors — it’s a microcosm of life. In this heartfelt segment, Chet Thomas and Darrin Fletcher explain how filmmaking gives every kind of student — creative, analytical, introverted, or extroverted — a place to shine. Their vision for education redefines what belonging looks like.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Karalee Sartin:** I love the idea that film can give everyone a place — that no matter your talents or background, there’s a role for you.

**Chet Thomas:** Absolutely. It takes *all types.*

It takes the creative kid who might not fit the mold — suddenly they get to shine and stand tall, showing what they can do.

It takes the analytical one who loves numbers — they’re our line producer. They figure out how to make the budget work, how to keep the dreamers on track.

It takes the social kid — they become the marketing team, the ones getting the word out and rallying people.

Then there’s construction — we need sets. The welding class? They’ve got a job. Culinary? We’ve got catering and craft services.

Even history classes — every period film needs researchers. English and creative writing for scripts. Web programming for film websites.

It all fits.

**Darrin Fletcher:** Even the athletes. I know so many stuntmen who were just jocks in high school — they loved being physical. Great! Bring it on.

Every classroom you can imagine can connect to film.

**Chet Thomas:** Which means film reaches *every type* of person. Every height, every background, every story — and says, “You belong here.”
