**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I'm Ella, your host, and today we are joined by Zach Kuhn. Zach, okay, you have a crazy story. Just lay it on me. Tell me, how did you get started in homeschool? What does your day-to-day look like today?

**Zach Koon:** Yeah. Thanks for having me, Ella. I really appreciate you inviting me to be on the show. So, it started back in 2021. My wife and I were looking at schools for our children. We have three kids, by the way. All of them are spitting images of my personality — whether that’s good or bad, you’d have to ask my wife, Rebecca.

Back in 2021, right at the height of COVID — should I stay home, should I go to work, what do we do? — we were trying to figure out whether we wanted to put our kids in public school or private school. And I have some friends who are teachers, and some of them said they didn’t really enjoy working at the schools because they felt pressured to push students through subject matter when the students weren’t ready.

That really bothered me. I didn’t want my kids to feel like they had to do something they couldn’t do yet. All of my kids have different personalities, and I know their learning styles. So we talked about homeschooling. Neither of us were homeschooled — both of us went to public school, played sports, had that traditional experience. Homeschool was completely foreign to us.

Over the course of a year, we sat down and talked about what we wanted our life to look like. We were getting uncomfortable in our house — it felt too small. So I brought up an idea that sounded completely crazy. I said, “Instead of selling our house and buying a bigger house, what if we just buy a 300-square-foot box and move into an RV and travel the country?”

So that’s what we did. I’m in my RV right now actually — with cabinets behind me and LED lights above my head. It’s been crazy, but the reason for homeschooling came from that feeling of unmet need. We wanted to live a more minimal life and have a say in how our kids are raised. So we made the leap — and we’ve been homeschooling and traveling in an RV for three and a half years now.

With wonder and wisdom, he explains how curiosity, nature, and real experience became their teachers.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** Has RV life changed your family at all? Especially when it comes to education — does exploring a new place every few weeks influence how your kids learn?

**Zach Koon:** Yeah. The biggest way it’s influenced their learning is by allowing them to experience people and places they never would’ve otherwise. We visit a lot of national parks, and all of our kids have become fascinated by science because of that.

We spend time talking about why a place looks the way it does — what shaped it, what created it. It’s something I never got growing up in the Midwest. I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything. It’s brought us closer together. We spend more time invested in our kids’ lives, and they’re invested in ours too.

It’s definitely been challenging — starting new routines, making friends — but it’s taught us adaptability. My son’s very extroverted, so at first, we worried about taking him away from local friends. But we realized we weren’t taking things away — we were opening new opportunities.

**Ela Richmond:** You mentioned your kids’ love for science — what do those adventures look like in practice?

**Zach Koon:** I think passion passes down. Our kids love science because my wife and I love the outdoors. We never saw our kids as a burden or obstacle to doing what we love. They’re a blessing — they let us share more of our lives with them.

Our favorite place ever was Zion National Park. Driving through the tunnel, surrounded by those red and gold canyon walls — you understand why they call it “Zion.” There’s this reverence. And while we’re there, I’m asking my kids: “Do you know how these canyons formed? Why the river looks like this?”

They get curious, they ask questions, and we talk. National parks have Junior Ranger programs where they complete booklets to earn badges. They learn geology, history, ecology — all through play and exploration.

We don’t really need a science curriculum because *our curriculum is outside around us.*

It’s a candid look at love, humility, and the art of staying connected under pressure.

### **Verbatim Transcript (00:19:00 – 00:22:00)**

**Ela Richmond:** I imagine that some people look at an RV — a 300-square-foot box — and think, “What happens when the kids are fighting? What happens when mom needs a break?” How do you deal with the chaos?

**Zach Koon:** Sometimes you just have to be a little sacrificial. I’ll tell my wife, Rebecca, “Take the truck and go for a drive. I’ve got the kids.” Our son loves to pick on his sisters — he’s mischievous — so yeah, sometimes it gets chaotic.

It can be really difficult because we’re in such a small space. We have to be patient and demonstrate that for our kids. As a kid, it’s hard to be patient. But I have to remember — we chose this life. So we adapt to it.

**Ela Richmond:** Has that strengthened your marriage too?

**Zach Koon:** Absolutely. Our marriage grows stronger every year. We have our ups and downs, sure, but we strive to understand each other and be quick to forgive. Even when I think she’s in the wrong — I have to admit my own faults too.

You can’t run from conflict when you’re 25 feet away from someone. You have to face it. You have to say, “We’re partners. We’re in this together. How can we work this out?”

We made a decision early on: no matter what happens, we’ll talk through it. The good, the bad, the ugly — all of it. That’s how we grow as a family.
