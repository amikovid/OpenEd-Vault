# FUll Episode

**Daniella Park:** [00:00:00] all five senses start firing up when you're baking because smell, taste, you're hearing things, you're seeing things, and all, all of that added actually makes the perfect classroom in your brain because then everything you're learning, seeing, doing, stays.

**Charlie Deist:** Hey everyone. Welcome back to the open ed podcast, Charlie Dice here. And I'm joined today by Daniela Park. Daniela is with a really cool and an innovative company called Baktivity. I'll turn it over to you, Daniela, to, to talk a little bit more about your background, but first of all, let me just say welcome and thanks for being here.

**Daniella Park:** Aw, thanks Charlie. Thanks for having me.

**Charlie Deist:** And I get the sense that you're wearing multiple hats there at Baktivity, including. appropriately a chef's hat, uh, but maybe you can tell us a little bit more just about [00:01:00] what bactivity is and what your role is.

**Daniella Park:** Oh, that's the glorious thing about Baktivity. You join this company, it's a family run company, and you come in thinking you'll do one thing, which was I was going to be their spokesperson and face of the company. And now I'm the chef behind the scenes that help head and create the recipes that go into the boxes.

**Daniella Park:** I also help film all their how to videos and YouTube videos. Uh, to help our little chef bakers, uh, increase their skills and yeah, just help manage the team and connects the learning, STEM learning to the recipes. It's really fun and a really dynamic team that no one wears one hat in our team. We all get down and dirty and the reason is.

**Daniella Park:** You know, one kitchens are crazy and two, we absolutely love the sugar out of our kids and our little bakers and everyone wants the best for them. So it just makes it a joy to do anything you can for this [00:02:00] company.

**Charlie Deist:** I'm going to have to hold my tongue with all the puns and jokes about, you know, if you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen. But, uh, and you alluded to the fact that, you know, the boxes, and that's sort of at the core of what you guys offer. It's a, a subscription. where, uh, families and especially I think you have a lot of customers who are in the sort of homeschooling camp or people who are building their own a la carte type of educational, you know, we call this open education has a lot of different names.

**Charlie Deist:** Uh, it's, it's really this sort of new thing where families are discovering that there's not just. One way you don't have to choose either a public school or one specific homeschooling curriculum, you can really mix and match. And I think you guys embody that even within your own product in that you can choose.

**Charlie Deist:** I'm just looking at the catalog right now. And there is, you know, all kinds of different kits where what, what are people actually getting in these boxes?

**Daniella Park:** [00:03:00] Yeah, I love this because everything you need to learn, have fun, create family memories are in a box, but bactivity is completely thinking out of the box, which I always find funny because it comes in a box. You have pre, um, measured ingredients. So there's less mess, less, um, fussing around for parents. So you actually get to focus on learning and whether it's because you want A child who's very interested in cooking, which is really popular right now.

**Daniella Park:** In that incorporates all this STEM learning that Nicole on the team who has, um, education background, really into young minds and learning. She creates things. So there's a math lesson, science lesson, but it's colorful and interesting. And Charlie with baking, you're actually igniting five of your senses.

**Daniella Park:** You know, all five senses start firing up when you're baking because [00:04:00] smell, taste, you know, you're hearing things, you're seeing things, and all, all of that added actually makes the perfect classroom in your brain because then everything you're learning, seeing, doing, stays. Because if you're in a classroom, you can't move, you can't, experience.

**Daniella Park:** There's no smell and noise and things like that. It actually doesn't connect into all the parts of your brain. So whether you have a kid that has more left side or more right side, you're connecting on a 50, 50 chance every day in the classroom where, you know, your kid who you're educating at home, no one knows them better than their guardian or parent.

**Daniella Park:** And by getting all five senses fired up, I'm telling you now, those lessons stick. They're fun. They're memorable. And. Easy for parents. We want to make your life a little easier because I'm sure, you know, there's so many layers to doing it yourself too. And I really take my apron off for all the [00:05:00] parents that are doing it.

**Daniella Park:** I know we're going to do it with my little Thomas. Uh, he's six months now, but we're definitely going down this route because we can see the results are just, are astonishing.

**Charlie Deist:** Right, and I think it's starting to become a little bit more of, uh, conventional wisdom, at least, that people learn better when there is a concrete experience around it that they can wrap their head around. When it's not just the abstract formulas on a chalkboard. I remember all the time in school, people would ask, when are we actually going to use this in real life?

**Charlie Deist:** And the answer is never quite right. Quite clicked. And now, you know, I do use algebra here and there. It's it's and one of one of my colleagues likes to talk about how basically what is algebra, but, uh, figuring solving a puzzle when you don't have all the information and so many times when you're baking, it's that same kind of thing where whether it's doing a conversion from to cut a recipe in half when you actually have a problem in front of you that you need to solve, it gives [00:06:00] you the actual, uh, Impetus to, to go through it and more than just going through the motions.

**Charlie Deist:** Uh, and, and so you mentioned that you're planning to, to use this curriculum yourself, can you tell us a little more about, , what your own educational journey was growing up and how that kind of brought you to this place? Cause I know you've, wear a lot of hats, even outside of Baketivity I'm curious to hear a little bit more about your, your background and your sort of professional, uh, resume.

**Daniella Park:** Absolutely. Just going back to one thing, the way you just explained algebra. If they could just do that in a classroom, it would help, I bet, 20 percent more, which is explaining that algebra isn't math. Oh, you say math here. We say maths in Australia, but it's so, so I don't confuse anyone. I don't have a list for anything.

**Daniella Park:** It's just maths, we say, but just explain that it's not just maths. It's actually solving a problem and explaining it in a more creative way, a more [00:07:00] practical way, and that's the life skills you get. In the Baktivity box, like you said, but yeah, to, to my background. So. Sixteen years old, severely dyslexic, still to this day if I don't practice spelling my name and writing it down, you know, I go red in my face because I can't spell it out loud and, you know, just really was left behind in the school system.

**Daniella Park:** Thank God I had amazing teachers that noticed that I got all the way to high school without being picked up for being dyslexic. Reason being, I was very Articulate and I was very well behaved. So I got away with a lot. Let me tell you and I had great teachers that supported me through but once I got to my senior year I could see that I was just not going to survive not with my confidence, not emotionally.

**Daniella Park:** It was hard because Here I was sitting in a classroom watching all these kids read books and participate and all I had was really my verbal skills but I [00:08:00] wasn't allowed to be tested on that. I had to write it down like everyone else and I knew that's just not my thing. I can't do that. Little did I know I had confidence somewhere deep down that I dug up, left school, but left it with a business plan and just I just begged my parents and teachers to just give me a chance.

**Daniella Park:** I started my first business at 16 years old. Uh, I used to help men buy gifts for women in the corporate sector. And my first client was Malaysian Airlines and they had no idea I was 16 years old with braces. But I did it. And then from there I continued. I, uh, started a company called Buttercream Lane, and that's where my baking skills started to come up, so I actually couldn't go to a formal baking school, although that will still be my dream to do one day.

**Daniella Park:** I instead now judge at the Cordon Bleu of Sydney and the Royal Easter Show, which is our, um, You know, main medal winning for foods. So I may not have been able to go to all those schools. I taught [00:09:00] myself off YouTube. So monkey see monkey do. I just used anything I could to teach myself. And I opened up a store that became quite famous.

**Daniella Park:** I was on morning TV, newspapers, magazines. I got to cook cookies with the cookie monster from Sesame Street. And I've been to Hugh Jackman's house to make him his Christmas Eve treats and their friends of ours. Cause I also represent their charities for, uh, adopt change and hopeland here in America to help kids all have safe nurturing homes.

**Daniella Park:** So all that led to then. Meeting Baktivity and they sent me a kit to use and I was not interested in taking up work in the US. I was, uh, wanting to have a rest. And they said, please just bake our recipe. We have a really good story. We really love kids. We know you do too. Could you just bake it? So they got me in like that.

**Daniella Park:** I baked their gingerbread house I'll never forget. And there was no way I thought this little red [00:10:00] box with these pre measured ingredients. So they still do the raw ingredients. So you're still learning a from scratch recipe, which is so important because we're losing that life skill of passing on classic recipes.

**Daniella Park:** Every child and adult should know how to make a classic cake, a classic bread, a classic, um, pastry, and then all the exciting stuff on top. But Really don't lose that. It has history. It has stories. It makes you more intelligent, I promise you, because you're working out fractions and science and all sorts of things.

**Daniella Park:** And it does help those who aren't interested in reading practice reading because you're actually interested in something. So therefore you're more willing to try. And with Baktivity, we've got, this is the part that really got me. Cause I'm dyslexic. It has a picture for each step. It has color coded stickers on the bags that match the color coded word in [00:11:00] the recipe.

**Daniella Park:** So like number one, that just took so much pressure on me trying to check that I'm doing the right thing. It just made it more enjoyable. And then they have a QR code that you scan and there's a how to video showing you step by step that you can play and pause and fast forward and rewind for however you need, whatever speed you're at.

**Daniella Park:** And it's really extensive. And then through the years of being with them, they've really grown their STEM learning side, which I hope to activate in video for them soon, because that's becoming even more popular. So yes, these kids want to get in the kitchen and yes, the parents are loving putting them in the kitchen because it's engaging and locks their attention in.

**Daniella Park:** And I don't know if you know, but especially for boys, um, research shows Uh, working with the little boy side by side, so not face to face, where the teacher's at the front of the classroom, child's sitting and facing. But instead at a kitchen counter, where you're side by side, a little boy is more likely to [00:12:00] interact.

**Daniella Park:** Because girls interact in classrooms, they're fine in different settings, different positions. But we're really seeing these boys interact a lot better because they're side by side, and they'll talk more, they'll engage more, because they're not so put on. the spot. And it's really interesting to see all the different dynamics between the little kids and their personalities and their learning abilities.

**Daniella Park:** But I know in my life classes, because when you get a subscription with us as well, you can get individual boxes, but I have life classes every month. And oh my gosh, it's like my favorite time of the month. Because there's like, Uh, a hundred kids or sometimes a little more, but we get to know each other over the year and you watch their skills increase.

**Daniella Park:** But I have special needs kids in my classes as well. And the beautiful thing is they can all work together seamlessly

**Charlie Deist:** Hmm.

**Daniella Park:** and the other kids help the other kids. It's such a beautiful way to connect.

**Charlie Deist:** I'm thinking back now to my own schooling and there would be [00:13:00] times I remember making, you know, a wild rice recipe that was apparently from the Native Americans of my time. And I remember these things. I don't remember very many projects from 5th grade. I also remember the time in high school when my buddy and I made churros for some kind of Spanish class question.

**Charlie Deist:** And I think we ended up scalding ourselves with the hot oil. So That might be one to, uh, to, to,

**Daniella Park:** A very important life skill.

**Charlie Deist:** Indeed, yeah, no, we, we learned, and actually, the, the problem was that we deviated from the template on that one. We tried to make a donut instead of using the little star shaped extruder, and so that one exploded.

**Daniella Park:** I love that, Charlie. That's, that's exactly what you should be doing though. You should be making mistakes. I tell my kids in the class all the time, now's the time, make the mistakes now. Like, because I'm here, so I'll teach you how to troubleshoot. Don't you think those skills for open learning is so much more important than.

**Daniella Park:** Stick to the curriculum. Here's what you must learn. You must get it right. [00:14:00] Here's your tick or here's your cross. No way. Make the mistake. Oh, you, Oh, you put too much sugar. You didn't measure that right. Oh, butter. Cause you wouldn't, we already measured the sugar for you, but you put too much butter. Hmm.

**Daniella Park:** Let's see. Try this, this and that. And then they come back to you and say, it worked. Okay. Now, you know, when you think, when you make a mistake in a recipe, try that and the other kids learn and things like that. It's. Just make mistakes. Please make mistakes.

**Charlie Deist:** Yeah, yeah. And it's even a kind of version of the scientific method of trial and error and you test a hypothesis. I want to hear more of the story of how you ended up with that gig with Malaysian Airlines. Because I think that we have very much this sort of, uh, permission based culture that maybe the school systems breed into us a little bit, where we think that you have to check the boxes and get the diploma, first the high school diploma, then a college diploma, and then you have to go apply for these jobs.

**Charlie Deist:** But it sounds like you figured [00:15:00] out a way to, to get your skills, this, this gift that you had for helping people who were hapless in this respect, uh, picking out other gifts for people. Can you tell just kind of the, the, the 32nd, maybe the two minute version of that story?

**Daniella Park:** Oh, it's really simple. You just, you just do it. No story. So I'm not allowed to put a story to it when I'm making the decision. So if I'm going to do something scary, I don't give myself time to say, oh, but they might say no. Oh, but I shouldn't. I'm so young. Or, this is my first time. No, no, no story. Okay.

**Daniella Park:** Pick up the phone. And I did, I just happened to I'm 16 years old. Really? I had no business starting business, but it was real fun. And I learned a lot. Um, 16 years old was just like thinking, what, who should I contact? And then just thought, you know what, I'm going to contact Malaysian airlines. And I just research and research till I found out that EA's in companies.

**Daniella Park:** By all the [00:16:00] gifts and to have all the connections to all the important, you know, heads of every department. So then I just picked a lot of corporate companies that had EA emails available on their website, put a lovely little package together and actually sent out little packages to that person and introduced myself.

**Daniella Park:** And I think I got 90%. You know, uh, return rate on that. And even when I had buttercream lane, I used to have, uh, clear boxes for my cupcakes. And when I had no clients at all, I used to walk in our CBD, which is our main city in Sydney, like the business part of the city. It's great. Make the most incredibly detailed cupcakes with like cute little faces on it or whatever I could think of and walk around the city with nowhere to go.

**Daniella Park:** Lying to everyone I meet that I'm actually on a delivery delivering these cakes, but because the box was clear. Everyone would stop me. There was not [00:17:00] one person that didn't twist their head going, where'd you get those from? Where? Oh my God. Can I take a photo? Do you have a card? And I never had a card. I had a cookie.

**Daniella Park:** And if I ran out of cookies, I'd say, I don't have a card. I ran out of cards. Can I have your email? It's a total lie. I had cards. But if I take their email, I have control of contacting that client. Them not forgetting me. Doing the work for them. I always say that. Do the work for your clients. And that's what Baktivity do too.

**Daniella Park:** They do the work for their clients. They won't trouble you more than what you need to do. Hence, everything pre measured. Learning, um, booklet already. Out there for you printed, nice and neat, they don't make you go to the website, download this, do this, it's all there, which I love about that, because I just don't think you should, um, trouble people to do more than they, life's busy enough as it is.

**Charlie Deist:** Right, right. No, I mean, when I think about what's thwarted me in a lot of my baking and cooking, but [00:18:00] especially baking adventures in the past is there's always that one ingredient you don't have and you need to go get it. And then you have way more of it than you're ever going to use for the foreseeable future.

**Charlie Deist:** So being able to try all these different recipes where you get what you need that you don't have standard, maybe some things like butter that don't ship so well, those, you know, the staples you have covered, but, uh, but, but it makes it so that the, the activation energy to sort of try one and the risk of it is sort of lower.

**Charlie Deist:** But then if you find something that you really love, you might say this time I'm going to buy these ingredients so I can make it myself. And you have a template for the future. So it, it kind of builds confidence in that way.

**Daniella Park:** And we gift you that recipe for life. So once you buy our bagel kit, you have that recipe for life. We want you to have family recipes. So we even have a Baktivity kids cookbook with all our kids that sent in recipes from home. And we have a family cookbook and that's really important. And the kids do try other kids. [00:19:00] Recipes and post them and share them and things like that Because it is like you've got to try something to know whether you're good at it. And I always say try it twice Because the first time you might be fiddling around or learning what does kneading mean? So we have a YouTube channel that you could actually watch and learn Uh, clip on how to need and, you know, really sharpen those skills cause they are important and you will learn a lot of things from it, but also you learn patience, which I think really in a world where kids are fixated on the screen.

**Daniella Park:** And I really, my heart aches for parents that I do see that, you know, they try so hard to keep them away. It is almost impossible to do that right now. Finding something that they are connected into and they are learning and that we can still kind of incorporate screens, like say, have a YouTube channel where they're learning something like kneading and then perfecting and sharpening that skill [00:20:00] and having them engage longer than a 15 second TikTok.

**Daniella Park:** You don't understand what that does to the cells in their brains. They're suddenly lit up. They're made stronger It's like working a muscle in the gym, and that's what we're trying to do. We want them to be engaged longer They're going to need it for their job. They're going to need it for life, family life and things like that which Is actually take it, taken into account when we are making these boxes, when Nicole is developing, um, the education, when Goldie develops all the pictures and graphics and things like that, we want it to be so it's every little inch of that booklet or that experience is going to educate, create a memory, um, and have fun because I've learned more things when I have fun.

**Charlie Deist:** For sure. And to just to elaborate on that screen time thing, it's not just the kids who are struggling with this. I know I struggle to get myself off of the scrolling type apps. It's it's Twitter for [00:21:00] me, but you know, I know that for, for the younger generation, it's more of the, the tick talks and the Snapchats.

**Charlie Deist:** I sound like such an old person saying that.

**Daniella Park:** hmm. Mm hmm.

**Charlie Deist:** my age here, but, um, but, but I think you make an important point about the importance of having something that draws people away from the screen, rather than just saying, you know, I'm going to force myself to put my phone away, you need something that pulls you out of it, something more compelling and, and those.

**Charlie Deist:** activities, especially in the sort of educational context can be hard to come by. I know that for myself, I need to structure my life in a way that, uh, it needs to be interesting enough to, to, so that I don't just get stuck in that lowest common denominator activity of, of scrolling. Uh, you also alluded earlier in your story to, to some of these other opportunities that you've had to, uh, [00:22:00] To, uh, work with Sesame Street and Hugh Jackman.

**Charlie Deist:** I think you said, I mean, those, those I'm sure are, are whole stories unto themselves, but, uh, but I'd love to hear more of your kind of life lessons and philosophy of, um, how to, you know, w w what it looks like to follow your passions and, and that's obviously taken you in some pretty, some pretty interesting places, uh, whereas if you had just sort of followed the path that was laid out.

**Charlie Deist:** for you by society or by the, the system. Uh, you might not have had those opportunities, but what, what would you say, what, what's your advice to a 16 year old who maybe has a passion or is looking to take the, the, the uncharted course,

**Daniella Park:** Yeah, absolutely. I had a similar chat to my 16 year old nephew who I won't name. I'll give him some privacy. But um, we just had a chat about this because he's going through whether to leave school or stay and he is a [00:23:00] laborer on the weekends just to earn money to try and get him used to the You know, life outside of school and he absolutely hates school.

**Daniella Park:** He's the smartest kid you could ever imagine. I'm talking articulate, the way he's brain things, he can engage in conversation. So he's got all the right tics for he's going to do great in a career. And I told him to keep one of the bricks that he is doing moving because he was like, I have to move, you know, 5, 000 bricks and this is so boring.

**Daniella Park:** This is never going to get me anywhere in life. I go, actually it is. Keep one of those bricks and we will store it. And I promise you when you're at the place that I think you want to be right now, I'm going to gift you that brick and we're going to put it in your office and then we'll paint it gold.

**Daniella Park:** And he was like, Oh, and I said, yeah, you're learning something now. You just don't know what you're learning. So I think really like, Telling kids, don't give up just because it's boring right now, or don't give up just because you are stuck in the school [00:24:00] system. Uh, find creative ways outside, so if you have to stay, because that's the only way you can, you know, get through, or you don't have the opportunities.

**Daniella Park:** Get things like, find things like, activity. And do that on the weekend. Because you will spark your joy again. You will see how smart you are. You will see how intelligent and what new things you can learn. And if that can hold you through till you can get to your window of opportunity then that's what you do.

**Daniella Park:** You start searching for those little things outside. For the kids that do get to do this and have that open education that we're loving right now. Then, you know, engage as much as you can, join live classes where you can join talks and go meet people. If you're interested in a job, ask your parents to reach out to that person.

**Daniella Park:** If it's a doctor's office, fire station, you'll be surprised how many people would be so loving and open to have you come in and experience a [00:25:00] day or a piece of time with them, which is so important. And that's what's going to get you. to where you want to go. I said yes to everything. Sometimes it worked.

**Daniella Park:** Most times it did. And sometimes it killed me, but it, it gave me lessons. Just say, yes, don't worry about the fear. Don't worry about the lies. You tell yourself that you can't, you shouldn't, dah, dah, dah. Just say, yes, work out how to do it. Ask for help and just get it done. That skill has gotten me Everywhere I wanted to go beyond what I could imagine and really made me a resilient person.

**Daniella Park:** But Charlie, the funny thing is, not just the 16 year old needs to hear that the parents of kids, especially the parents of kids with learning disabilities. I always speak to them and I always say, please spend 80 percent of your kid's week on things that they are interested in and good at. Don't worry about if it has education to it [00:26:00] even.

**Daniella Park:** If, if he or she likes to ride a skateboard, spend 80 percent of their week riding a skateboard or learning about skateboards and that like, you know, when they come down the slope, like what's the angle and speed and how does that affect it? Oh, how interesting. Should we go try that? Let's see how fast you go down.

**Daniella Park:** I wonder if you know, this wheel lifts up on, and that's aerodynamics. And I don't know anything about skateboards, but if my son was into it, I'd make the effort to know, and then spend 20 percent of the time fixing what they think is the problem. And I say it like that in inverted commas, because dyslexia.

**Daniella Park:** Was never a problem for me. It was a problem for everyone else. I love it. It gives me, I have to work 10 times harder than everyone else, which gives me a drive edge further than any colleagues I have. It, you know, motivates me to learn things different ways. It helps me connect with people differently.

**Daniella Park:** Like it's given me so much. [00:27:00] Everyone else had a problem with my illiteracy, I think it was a gift, like I've used it to the best I can and that's why I really tell parents, please, please, please, you, I know it's extra work on you, but you worrying and being scared for your child's future is so much more energy than you finding out how a skateboard works and engaging your kid that way and then, oh, Don't just sit there at a desk telling them.

**Daniella Park:** Take them out to the skate park and practice it and take photos of them and videos to show them and you know, everyone's savvy now. Draw little graphs and arrows. Oh, let's measure. Okay, so that angle was a 45 degree angle and put a maths lesson in it. I bet you could do it. And then when you need help, go to people like us, like Baktivity, and get a kit and say, oh, here's a reward.

**Daniella Park:** You know, you learnt this, this and that. Let's bake something together, bake it and then sneak the STEM lesson in there because it works.

**Charlie Deist:** That's awesome. That, that was just, uh, that was the icing on the cake. We'll say, [00:28:00] uh, you know, what I take away most from this is just, You The idea of saying yes to everything and, uh, and, and not necessarily, uh, you know, uh, letting the, the, the dictates of, of the, the people around you, uh, determine your, your future.

**Charlie Deist:** Uh, and, and of course, as, as Eli from, from Baktivity would say, let's make it big.

**Daniella Park:** Yes. Bake the world a better place. His brother Mini always says too. They're just such gorgeous people, them and their partners and wives and families. Do you know their kids even test my boxes? So they, when I do a recipe, yep. And they're very good at giving feedback. Even the CEO, the founders kids, they'll test the boxes, tell me what they think.

**Daniella Park:** And that's why I say, it's not just a pretend family business. They're really involved and that's just so much love poured into this.

**Charlie Deist:** So people who want to learn more they can go to baketivity. com, that's pretty [00:29:00] much spelled like it sounds and uh, anywhere else, anything else that you'd want to direct them to? Social media or otherwise?

**Daniella Park:** Yeah, definitely. There's BAKETIVITY on Instagram. We have a private baking group on Facebook and it's again BAKETIVITY, but please join it because even if you want to ask questions about, you know, family meals or, uh, you're baking something and need help, we're all inclusive. Like join the baking family, ask us what you need.

**Daniella Park:** We want to help you on your journey in the kitchen because the kitchen's the heart of the home. So definitely pop in.

**Charlie Deist:** Right on. Alright. Daniella, thank you again for taking the time. This has been an amazing conversation. I feel inspired. I'm going to be saying yes to more things, so

**Daniella Park:** Yay!

**Charlie Deist:** thanks again and let's bake it big. Mhm.

**Daniella Park:** Thanks, Charlie.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

> **Charlie Deist:** [00:00:00] can you tell us a little more about, um, what your own educational journey was growing up and how that kind of brought you to this place? Cause I know you've, you've wear a lot of [00:00:10] hats, even outside of Baketivity I'm curious to hear a little bit more about your, your background and your sort of professional, uh, resume.
> 
> 
> **Daniella Park:** Absolutely. [00:00:20] Just going back to one thing, the way you just explained algebra. If they could just do that in a classroom, it would help, I bet, 20 percent more, which is [00:00:30] explaining that algebra isn't math. Oh, you say math here. We say maths in Australia, but it's so, so I don't confuse anyone. I don't have a list for anything.
> 
> It's [00:00:40] just maths, we say, but just explain that it's not just maths. It's actually solving a problem and explaining it in a more creative way, a more practical way, [00:00:50] and that's the life skills you get. In the Baktivity box, like you said, but yeah, to, to my background. So. Sixteen years old, severely [00:01:00] dyslexic, still to this day if I don't practice spelling my name and writing it down, I go red in my face because I can't spell it out loud and, you know, just really was left [00:01:10] behind in the school system.
> 
> Thank God I had amazing teachers that noticed that I got all the way to high school without being picked up for being dyslexic. Reason being, I was [00:01:20] very Articulate and I was very well behaved. So I got away with a lot. Let me tell you and I had great teachers that supported me through but [00:01:30] once I got to my senior year I could see that I was just not going to survive not with my confidence, not emotionally.
> 
> It was hard because [00:01:40] Here I was sitting in a classroom watching all these kids read books and participate and all I had was really my verbal skills but I wasn't allowed to be [00:01:50] tested on that. I had to write it down like everyone else and I knew that's just not my thing. I can't do that.
> 
> I started my first business at 16 years old. Uh, [00:02:00] I used to help men buy gifts for women in the corporate sector. And my first client was Malaysian Airlines and they had no idea I was 16 years old with braces. But [00:02:10] I did it. And then from there I continued. I, uh, started a company called Buttercream Lane, and that's where my baking skills started to come up, so I actually couldn't go to a formal baking [00:02:20] school, although that will still be my dream to do one day.
> 
> I instead now judge at the Cordon Bleu of Sydney and the Royal Easter Show, which is our, [00:02:30] main medal winning for foods. So I may not have been able to go to all those schools. I taught myself off YouTube. So monkey see monkey do. I just used anything I could [00:02:40] to teach myself. And I opened up a store that became quite famous.
> 
> I was on morning TV, newspapers, magazines. [00:02:50] I got to cook cookies with the cookie monster from Sesame Street. And I've been to Hugh Jackman's house to make him his Christmas Eve treats and their friends of ours. Cause I [00:03:00] also represent their charities for, uh, adopt change and hopeland here in America to help kids all have safe nurturing homes.
> 
> So all that led [00:03:10] to then. Meeting Baktivity and they sent me a kit to use and I was not interested in taking up work in the US. I was, uh, [00:03:20] wanting to have a rest. And they said, please just bake our recipe. We have a really good story. We really love kids. We know you do too. Could you just bake it? So they got me in like that.
> 
> [00:03:30] I baked their gingerbread house I'll never forget. And there was no way I thought this little red box with these pre measured ingredients. So they still do the [00:03:40] raw ingredients. So you're still learning a from scratch recipe, which is so important because we're losing that life skill of passing on classic [00:03:50] recipes.
> 
> Every child and adult should know how to make a classic cake, a classic bread, a classic, um, pastry, and then all the [00:04:00] exciting stuff on top. But Really don't lose that. It has history. It has stories. It makes you more intelligent, I promise you, because you're working [00:04:10] out fractions and science and all sorts of things.
> 
> And it does help those who aren't interested in reading practice reading because you're actually interested in something. [00:04:20] So therefore you're more willing to try. And with Baktivity, we've got, this is the part that really got me. Cause I'm dyslexic. It has a picture for each step. [00:04:30] It has color coded stickers on the bags that match the color coded word in the recipe.
> 
> So like number one, that just took so much pressure on [00:04:40] me trying to check that I'm doing the right thing. It just made it more enjoyable. And then they have a QR code that you scan and there's a how to video showing you step by step that you [00:04:50] can play and pause and fast forward and rewind for however you need, whatever speed you're at.
> 
> And it's really extensive. And then through the years of being with them, they've [00:05:00] really grown their STEM learning side, which I hope to activate in video for them soon, because that's becoming even more popular. So yes, these kids [00:05:10] want to get in the kitchen and yes, the parents are loving putting them in the kitchen because it's engaging and locks their attention in.
> 
> And I don't know if you know, but especially for boys, [00:05:20] um, research shows Uh, working with the little boy side by side, so not face to face, where the teacher's at the front of the classroom, child's sitting and facing. But [00:05:30] instead at a kitchen counter, where you're side by side, a little boy is more likely to interact.
> 
> Because girls interact in classrooms, they're fine in different [00:05:40] settings, different positions. But we're really seeing these boys interact a lot better because they're side by side, and they'll talk more, they'll engage more, because they're not so put on. [00:05:50] the spot. And it's really interesting to see all the different dynamics between the little kids and their personalities and their learning abilities.
> 
> But I know in my life classes, [00:06:00] because when you get a subscription with us as well, you can get individual boxes, but I have life classes every month. And oh my gosh, it's like my favorite time of the month. Because there's like, [00:06:10] Uh, a hundred kids or sometimes a little more, but we get to know each other over the year and you watch their skills increase.
> 
> But I have special needs kids in my classes as well. [00:06:20] And the beautiful thing is they can all work together seamlessly
> 
> and the other kids help the other kids. It's such a beautiful way to connect.
> 
> **Charlie Deist:** I'm thinking back now to my [00:06:30] own schooling and there would be times I remember making, you know, a wild rice recipe that was apparently from the Native Americans of [00:06:40] my time. And I remember these things. I don't remember very many projects from 5th grade. I also remember the time in high school when my buddy and I made churros for some kind [00:06:50] of Spanish class question.
> 
> And I think we ended up scalding ourselves with the hot oil. So That might be one to, uh, to, to,
> 
> **Daniella Park:** A very important life skill.
> 
> **Charlie Deist:** Indeed, yeah, no, we, [00:07:00] we learned, and actually, the, the problem was that we deviated from the template on that one. We tried to make a donut instead of using the little star shaped extruder, and so that one exploded.
> 
> **Daniella Park:** I love [00:07:10] that, Charlie. That's, that's exactly what you should be doing though. You should be making mistakes. I tell my kids in the class all the time, now's the time, make the mistakes now. Like, [00:07:20] because I'm here, so I'll teach you how to troubleshoot. Don't you think those skills for open learning is so much more important than.
> 
> Stick to the curriculum. Here's [00:07:30] what you must learn. You must get it right. Here's your tick or here's your cross. No way. Make the mistake. Oh, you, Oh, you put too much sugar. You didn't measure [00:07:40] that right. Oh, butter. Cause you wouldn't, we already measured the sugar for you, but you put too much butter. Hmm.
> 
> Let's see. Try this, this and that. And then they come back to you and say, it worked. Okay. Now, you know, [00:07:50] when you think, when you make a mistake in a recipe, try that and the other kids learn and things like that. It's. Just make mistakes. Please make mistakes.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Charlie Deist:** You mentioned that you’re planning to use this curriculum yourself. Can you tell us a little more about your own educational journey?

**Daniella Park:** Sixteen years old, severely dyslexic—still to this day if I don’t practice spelling my name, I go red in the face. I can’t spell it out loud. I was really left behind in the school system. Thank God I had amazing teachers who noticed me late—high school late. I was articulate, well-behaved, so I got away with a lot.

Once I got to my senior year, I could see I wasn’t going to survive—not emotionally. It was hard watching kids read and participate while I couldn’t. All I had were my verbal skills, but I wasn’t allowed to be tested on that. I had to write like everyone else, and I knew, “That’s just not my thing.”

Little did I know, I had confidence somewhere deep down. I left school—with a business plan. I begged my parents and teachers to just give me a chance. At sixteen, I started my first business helping men buy gifts for women in the corporate sector. My first client was Malaysian Airlines—and they had no idea I was sixteen with braces!

From there, I taught myself everything on YouTube—monkey see, monkey do. I opened a bakery that got on TV, in magazines, cooked cookies with Cookie Monster, and made treats for Hugh Jackman’s family. Dyslexia didn’t stop me; it gave me drive, empathy, and creativity.

### Description:

Most people wait for permission to start. They worry they're too young, too inexperienced, or don't have the right credentials. But what if the only thing stopping you is the story you're telling yourself?
In this clip, Daniella Park shares the exact guerrilla marketing tactics she used at 16 to land a corporate client.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Charlie Deist:** I want to hear more of the story of how you ended up with that gig with Malaysian Airlines…

**Daniella Park:** Oh, it’s really simple. You just *do it.* No story. When I’m making a decision, I don’t give myself time to say, “They might say no,” or “I’m too young.” No story. Pick up the phone.

I was sixteen. I had no business starting a business—but it was fun. I researched corporate companies, found the EAs who bought gifts, and mailed them little packages. Ninety percent responded.

Later, when I started Buttercream Lane, I’d walk through Sydney’s business district holding a box of cupcakes. Everyone would stop me—“Where’d you get those?” I didn’t have cards; I had cookies. And if I ran out, I’d lie and say, “Oh, I’m out of cards—can I have your email?”

Do the work for your clients. Don’t wait for someone to tell you you’re ready. Just say yes, then figure it out.
