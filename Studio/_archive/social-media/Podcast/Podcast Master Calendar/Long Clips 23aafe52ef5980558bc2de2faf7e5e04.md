**Closing:** "...So just seeing what those limitations were, it like it does for a lot of teachers, it becomes very frustrating because what you want to be able to do is individualize the instruction because you know that that's best because you care about each one of those kids as individuals, but there's not enough time in the day and there's not enough structures in place to be able to teach them as individuals."
