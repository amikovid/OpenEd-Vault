## **Long Form 1 — “Education Is About Relationships”**

### Title:

- “Education Is About Relationships — Not Technology”
- “Why Self-Paced Learning Fails (and What Works Instead)”
- “The Secret to Lifelong Learning: Human Connection”
- “Why the Best Teachers Never Quit”
- “The Real Reason Students Stop Learning Online”

### Description:

In this deeply reflective exchange, *Ray Ravaglia* shares what decades of online education taught him about the real key to learning: relationships. He recounts how even the most gifted students lose motivation without human connection, and how teachers rediscover joy when they stop being “tools of the machine.” A masterclass in the human side of technology.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ray Ravaglia:** What I find so interesting, listening to your story, is that we made this move in the nineties into the two-thousands where everything became about individualized, self-paced, anytime-anywhere learning.

And what we found was, yeah, students could accelerate for a while — but then they’d lose interest and drift away.

If we connected them with other students, though, they’d stay engaged for *years*. You want to be able to say, “Dude, check this out.” When you’ve learned something new, you want to show it off. If that interaction is missing, it’s just not compelling.

We realized the same thing for teachers. When we ran purely self-paced courses, instructors optimized their work to three hours a day — and then they quit. Because when you’re just a tool of the machine, it’s not enjoyable. You don’t go into teaching for that.

When we switched to synchronous classes — live, real-time teaching — they’d complain about the workload, but they *never quit.* They loved it. They built relationships. Attrition dropped from 30% to 2%.

At the end of the day, education is about relationships — with each other, and with your professor. If you’re not forming those, it’s not going to be enjoyable.

The technology has to enable that — not replace it.

## **Long Form 2 — “Fire Your School”**

### Title:

- “Why Parents Should ‘Fire’ Their School”
- “Stop Outsourcing Your Child’s Education”
- “You’re Your Child’s Employer — Act Like It”
- “What Every Parent Gets Wrong About Schools”
- “How to Take Back Control of Your Child’s Education”

### Description:

In this provocative and empowering segment, Ray Ravaglia reframes the parent-school relationship with a simple but radical idea: *you’re the employer — not the employee.* Drawing from his op-ed “Fire Your School,” he explains why parents must set the terms, demand quality, and walk away if those terms aren’t met. It’s a call to reclaim ownership of education.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Matt Bowman:** Ray, you just summarized the Open Education book. That’s exactly it — parents have to ask: what role am I hiring my school to play for my children?

**Ray Ravaglia:** Thank you, Matt. Yeah — I actually wrote an op-ed a few years back called *Fire Your School.*

The idea was simple: you’re not their subordinate — you’re their employer.

Run through the questions. If you’re not happy with the answers, go in and make demands. And if they don’t make the changes you want, go somewhere else.

If people demand options and alternatives, they will appear. The market will create them.

What frustrates me is that parents still act like schools are doing them a favor. They forget — they’re paying for this, with their taxes, their time, and their trust.

And when you treat a system like a service, it starts working for you again.

## **Long Form 3 — “The Future of Education (and AI)”**

### Title:

- “AI Won’t Replace Teachers — But It Will Change Everything”
- “The Next 10 Years of Education”
- “What AI Means for the Future of Learning”
- “How Technology Will Bring Back Real Teaching”
- “The Coming Revolution in Education”

### Description:

Ray Ravaglia, founder of Stanford Online High School, offers a visionary glimpse into the future of education and AI. From the return of “non-digital skills” to the power of emotional analytics and one-on-one tutoring at scale, this clip blends technological foresight with humanistic wisdom — a rare glimpse of what learning could look like in 2035.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ella Richmond:** Where do you think we’re going in education over the next five or ten years?

**Ray Ravaglia:** That’s always the challenge — what are we educating people *for*?

I think AI is going to bring us back to the value of *non-digital* skills. Wood shop. Handwriting. Things you can *do.*

But it’s also going to let us focus on *process* instead of product. In ideal education — one-on-one tutoring — you don’t need a test. You just watch the student and you *know* if they understand.

The problem is, in a classroom you can’t watch everyone. You have to switch to testing and statistics.

Once we have technology that can *see* the process — cameras, sensors, micro-expressions — we’ll be able to intervene at the right moment. Let people make mistakes, but not too many. Catch confusion before it becomes frustration.

It’s about keeping students in that “zone of proximal development” — the sweet spot where learning happens.

I think we’ll get there in ten years — when someone builds the killer app everyone wants, and it actually works.

And when that happens, we won’t be talking about “school” the way we do now. We’ll be talking about *learning environments* that finally understand how humans learn.
