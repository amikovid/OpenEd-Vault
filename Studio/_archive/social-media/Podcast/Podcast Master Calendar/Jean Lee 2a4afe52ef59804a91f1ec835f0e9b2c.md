Context from Ela: 

0:01: So, I think this episode can really speak for itself.
0:04: There's not anything that I think you should know other than this backstory.
0:09: So, Jean is a mom of 3.
0:12: She never expected to homeschool.
0:14: She now runs a kind of group in her home where she teaches kids, 130 kids twice a week, and she also runs the biggest, homeschool.
0:28: Expo in the Midwest.
0:30: So she does a lot.
0:32: that gives context to kind of her.
0:36: She's a very, she's pretty intense.
0:38: But because she has so many hands everywhere inside of Indiana, she also talks to tons of families, and she's also very, very involved online.
0:49: she's very involved in different social groups and things like that.
0:52: She talks to tons of families, about About homeschooling, about the, the challenges, about their fears initially going into it.
1:03: So we talked a bit about that.
1:06: the best things that come along with homeschooling.
1:08: She's a very real person though, like, whenever it comes to talking about the pros of homeschooling, she's also very honest about the challenges as well.
1:17: and so it wasn't just kind of like a, an overly idealistic chat about homeschooling.
1:25: It was actually really, really grounded.
1:27: Like she did a fantastic job of telling her story, talking about the challenges, but also talking about the ways that she has learned to mitigate some of those challenges.
1:36: So, like teaching multiple kids and teaching kids that are gifted and advanced, and also teaching kids that have certain types of disabilities and, and ADHD and different types of things that make certain types of learning harder.
1:51: We talked about how she doesn't really love the idea of de-schooling and she's definitely more structured than I think most of the homeschool moms that I've talked to recently.
2:01: I think this is a really, really good episode for that reason.
2:06: I think she's figured out a lot that a lot of homeschool families still struggle with in terms of the how structured, how flexible do I need to make it.
2:15: And also, I think she's really, really done a beautiful job of finding the things that work for her kids really well.
2:21: So like she puts her kids into a lot of, a lot of different types.
2:26: Of, of activities.
2:27: So one of her kids is in a nature school, one of them is in karate, one of them is in music, and like she allows homeschooling to be the thing that lets them do all those things because she can take the kids and they can do their homeschooling at somebody's practices or something like that.
2:44: Anyways, Yeah, it was, it was a lot of stuff.
2:49: I think there will be a lot for you to grasp on too, but the highest, here's what the episode was about us talking through her experience and her experience with other families that are considering homeschool.
3:03: It's a very practical episode, and there's a lot of like pretty practical, Anecdotal things.
3:13: So, anyways, hope that helps.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:01.206)
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella and today I have on Jean Lee. Jean is an absolute powerhouse. The first time that I ever chatted with her, I was so impressed and just like absolutely floored by all that she's done. She homeschools her own children and she's even kind of created an academy situation where she helps homeschool other families as well. So before we get into all of that, Jean.

Out of curiosity, did you always want to homeschool?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (00:32.775)
I did not always want to home school. Like everyone, COVID changed my family's lives as well. And my kids came home, we started in traditional classroom public school. But there were some challenges that I was aware of. I have three very unique learners, and they're highly gifted, twice exceptional. And that doesn't always work well in a traditional classroom situation. But I didn't know what I didn't know. And coming home gave me the opportunity to try something different. If you would have asked me,

Almost a decade ago, Jean, would you be a homeschool mom? I would have said, no, that's weird. I didn't know. And I am so thankful now that I'm able to participate as a parent and be such a champion of school choice and alternative learning methods. To help families truly create custom education is amazing.

Ela Richmond (01:23.768)
So go into that a little bit. Was it a gradual experience going from, I'll never homeschool to, you know what, maybe this actually has something for my kids in it. Was it a gradual experience and what started changing your mind?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (01:38.641)
It was not a gradual experience. was literally school is closed and we all came home. So it was immediate for us. But interestingly enough, I see this happen everywhere I go. It doesn't matter if we're at soccer, if we are at ballet, if we are sitting on a park bench, if we were waiting at lacrosse. I talk to hundreds and hundreds of families every week and conversations are always similar. Hey, is that your kid over there? Yeah, that's mine. She's seven.

We're homeschool family. Do you homeschool? No, we're in a traditional school at XYZ. have you ever considered it? Do you know about it? And before long, it may be the next week I see them, it may be a couple weeks later, or it may be that they see me somewhere and find me out and say, hey, Jean, I remember we talked about your family being homeschoolers. Can you tell me more about that? And one of the coolest things about being in that space is I love being

family's first homeschool friend. I love getting to be the person who gives them that positive perspective. I didn't have that friend and I sure wish I had because my transition was hundreds of hours of research, understanding what is challenging for my kids, what is their learning method, how can I help them? And as a neuroscientist, understanding their cognition method was really important to me. So I invested a ton of time.

in figuring out all the different kinds of learning resources, methods, types of alternative learning that's available. And I love that I get to make that transition easier, smoother for others. For me, it happened instantly because we were home. But I see it happening in a thoughtful, gentle way for many, families now.

Ela Richmond (03:29.174)
That is amazing. So your background is in neuroscience you mentioned. Okay, and what kind of a perspective, you already kind of touched on it a little bit, but like what kind of a perspective did that give you going into homeschooling? Obviously you knew what homeschooling was on this kind of general, in this general way, but like really getting into the weeds about like what is homeschooling, right? And then,

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (03:33.746)
It is.

Ela Richmond (03:55.822)
Were there some biases that you had to kind of work through or like things that you were thinking that homeschooling was that you had to work through?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (04:04.201)
Absolutely. So there is definitely a general bias if you've never homeschooled or you don't know anything about it. This perception that we just stay home all the time, sit around our dining room table, all joyously reading books and learning together. There is also a bias that we're not learning deeply, that our children are not going to be smart because they're not taught by a licensed instructor.

Something that I love is talking about those topics and the reality is that we're never home. We are always learning deeply. We outsource many things and when I say outsource that means that we start our morning with piano lessons. So we drive to our piano instructor's house and do our piano lessons and my kids start that when they're three years old because we have the time. My kids all play multiple sports. They take fine art lessons. They participate in clubs and classes.

And I teach two full days of really deep learning in STEM topics. And so there are many, many people pouring into my children from a learning perspective. We're not staying home. Socialization is not an issue. We have way more friends because we have time for those friendships that we didn't have when the whole day was spent sitting in a desk. It's very, very different.

Ela Richmond (05:28.268)
What, mean, and you kind of mentioned this a little bit, but I would love your perspective. When you're talking to families that are just thinking about homeschooling, like they are just getting that thought into their mind. It's barely a thought, right? Like maybe they've encountered some challenges and they're like, maybe homeschool would be better, I don't know. What is the value that you put in front of them? Like what are your favorite things about homeschooling?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (05:55.198)
You know, it's funny, families reach out with a handful of almost always the same questions. It would be one, our child is gifted and we feel like they're not being challenged enough in school. Two, we're concerned about the levels of safety in the classroom and what that means for a kid not being with us. Three, bullying. We don't like the social conflict that's happening. We would like a more gentle.

space for learning and we want it to be focused on academics and not all of those social challenges. Those are the biggest questions that I get and reasons why families say we're thinking about something else but we're not sure what to do. And then people always say well what are the pros or cons of home education and alternative learning? One, the biggest pro is more time with your children. You are so deeply and actively involved with them you're spending the whole day together and it's kind of funny because

I have a lot of moms who will say, I couldn't imagine doing that. I couldn't do that. Spend the whole day with my kids. Well, we do that when they're young and we enjoy that time. We soak it all in. And the reality is culturally, our children function differently when they're not raised by peers. There's a different set of ideas when it comes to your family being your primary community. And there are a lot of books.

that I've written about this idea of family being your primary community and that connectedness that comes with that, which is very different when you have that separation. Oftentimes I hear parents say, well, that's just a tween thing. They just want to go to their room and hang out with their friends. I don't see that same thing happening in the realm of homeschooling. Families who are using home education are very connected. Where I go, all of my kids go with me all the time, every day.

all day long. And that's how we work. If we're going to the grocery store, if we are going to someone else's class, if we're going on a play date, if we're going to a park, if we're going to a museum, everybody's going with. And when we sit down to have dinner at night, they're also all there. Nobody's going off to play video games in the room by themselves. We talk, we share stories, we talk about ideas, and it's a different, it's a different connectedness that you have. And that only comes with time shared.

Ela Richmond (08:14.754)
Mm-hmm.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (08:17.683)
Think of it how friendships develop and grow. You have to have time together for that to blossom. And it works the same with families. When you see your kid for an hour every night, you don't have that time to have connection.

Ela Richmond (08:30.284)
Yeah, I love that point. heard something similar where it was, I forget who was saying this, but it was something to the effect of at a certain point in their teenage years, your child determines who their number one trusted source is. And that will be who they turn to. And it's either their peers or it's their parents. And as a parent, you to be very careful because when a child gets it in their mind that their peer is the first person that they should turn to,

then when they're struggling, then when anything is going wrong, like they will shut you out and they'll go to their peers instead. And I was having a conversation with somebody that I know and I'm close to and they were saying that it's so weird to them that like some kids turn out just like their family and some kids like turn out the opposite. And I was sharing this thought with them because I think it probably relates where like,

in those key moments when you are dealing with challenge, if you have built the underlying and fundamental trust that you need in order to turn to your family, then those will be the values that shape those difficult moments versus the opposite. you don't necessarily know who your kids' friends are all the time. You don't know who their number one trusted sources are all the time. And even if you do, you don't always know their number one values. And so it's a lot easier as a parent to just

build that relationship. And I would love to hear a couple more things that you hear frequently from families. You said the first one is the biggest pro is more time with your kids. And you always hear families say that like, I can't imagine myself because my kids so long. What else is a big pro and what else do hear families saying?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (10:16.361)
As a mom with three gifted learners, I can pour into them. I can let them learn as fast or as slow as they need. Now, typically children who are highly gifted struggle in a traditional classroom because they're expected to either go along with their average peers or if they're twice exceptional, some things will be really hard, painfully hard, and some things will be just so accelerated.

even advanced classes, even an AP level class is not accelerated enough for them. And therefore what happens is they're actually put into the same groups as remedial students. They're put into groups with kids who have learning challenges. So they're not able to thrive. The traditional classrooms really don't have great accommodations for that situation. And it's neither good nor bad. It just is how the system functions.

My kids are able to go quickly. my oldest, all of my kids started reading when they were three. Their education accelerated because of that. They had access to information and became very independent learners from a very young age. If they were in a traditional classroom, which I saw with my oldest, she was seven years old in a class of peers, many of them who couldn't yet read. And she had been already reading for four years.

reading well, reading at a high level. So accelerated learning is definitely a pro. And then depth of learning. So being able to experience having not just a book learning and a quiz, or there's no books now, everything is on a Chromebook. So when kids go to school, they're handed a Chromebook. They don't even get a physical textbook, which is and can be a huge detriment for many students.

especially kids with ADHD, they struggle without having persistence of information. And when you're skipping between screens, you don't have that. So being able to not only accelerate, go faster in subjects, but have a depth of learning that you can't get in a classroom. When we're setting a topic, we will study from a traditional textbook. We will seek out other books at the library. We will watch documentaries. We will research online. We will write essays.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (12:40.979)
but we'll also take field trips. We go to Chicago often, we go to Cincinnati often. There's a whole group of kids that I teach each week that just took an international trip and traveled all over Europe together. And one of the classes that I cover is art history. They came back, they had been to the Louvre, they had seen them work on the masters, and it was so awesome to read their essays on those great works, having experienced it firsthand. Yeah, that's not something you get.

Ela Richmond (13:07.458)
That is so cool. no, no, not at all. And I feel like the harder part is like, even if let's say you go on some of those trips with your classes, it's like, there's just like an underlying, at least this was my experience, there's just like an underlying sense of dread just because it's like school related. Like, it doesn't awaken the excitement or the curiosity in the same way.

What else do families come to you and chat about? Like, are they asking? What are they interested in? And what are their biggest hangups?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (13:47.404)
one of the biggest hangups is I could never do that. I could never teach my child math, literature, writing, science. Those are always big concerns. But the reality is when a licensed teacher goes to college, they don't go to college to learn all of the content that they're going to teach. So you don't go get a license to teach fourth grade and learn all the content for fourth grade. You use curriculum, which guides your learning.

And it's the same way in homeschool. I have taught every grade from pre-K all the way up to ninth grade in every subject. And I do that through using quality curriculum. I choose what I'm going to use. I review the material. And then I have the freedom to add on all of the extras, all of the experiments and labs and, as I said, trips and documentaries. But it can be scary.

when you're first starting, especially if you have a young child and you haven't experienced a high level of independent learning in a child and you think, I could never teach math. I was terrible at math. One story I love to share is that I grew up learning procedural math. It was a huge detriment to me as a child. I always felt like I was bad at math. I didn't understand math. And when I started teaching my children at home, I chose Singapore dimensions. I loved that.

Curriculum because it has three models, three different methods for every single problem. And I suddenly had it click. I saw a visual method that worked for me and I suddenly had number sense and I suddenly understood. Now, in my late 40s was I bad at math? Let me tell you, previously in my career, before becoming a homeschool parent, I managed multi-million dollar budgets to the penny for some of the world's largest brands.

I was not bad at math. I just didn't have great numbers since. I wasn't fast in my head because I didn't understand the way that I was taught. I love making this a game changer for kids and parents. When a parent now says to me, I'm not good at math, I tell them, you just don't understand yet. But you are. Everyone can be good at math.

Ela Richmond (16:08.213)
I love, love, love that perspective. I feel like there's also this fear of doing it right. And you mentioned the whole fact that teachers don't go to school and learn the whole curriculum and every single thing that they're gonna teach fourth grader and then they're bound to it. They follow some steps. But I feel like there's this pressure, like, what if I do it wrong? Or like, what if I take a year and I'm trying to help my kids learn in the way that fits them and then I feel like I failed?

And then everybody's going to judge the fact that I tried to do it and I didn't do it right.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (16:43.281)
I do a lot of parent mentoring. fact, last week, and I spent about five hours with a mother who has an eighth grader and she had that same fear. She said, what if I, what if I mess up? And I said, you've taught your child the most important things in life. They can dress themselves. They can walk. They can feed themselves. They are functioning young adults doing well. This is just giving them knowledge. And the beautiful thing is you don't realize how much time you do actually have.

I love using an online scheduling tool to lay out our lessons for the entire year. I had those same fears. And when I lay out my schedule, I realize, and I don't stress about it anymore because I have a visual, I can see our math curriculum, if we do one lesson every weekday, just five days a week, no extra time, scheduling and holidays and vacation breaks, we're still gonna get done at the beginning of April. So one thing that we don't account for is,

all of the extra time and days that traditional classrooms taking off. When you come from that space, you don't have a visual of your schedule there. You just think they're going so many days and they must be doing so much. But in reality, you're going more quickly because you have a single student. You have way more days than you realize. And we actually go year round. My kids go year round. We just end one level and go on to the next. But it snowed in Indiana this week. So we had

A great snow day and I said, we're not doing school today. We're all going outside all day. And we did and it was fantastic. And we had a blast and we just came right back to it the next day. Was that time wasted or lost? No. Are we behind in any way? No. We also, if we travel, we'll take it on the plane. If we're driving on a Saturday, we drove to Florida several times in the last year. It's an 18 hour drive. That's a great amount of time to get all those math and grammar lessons done. So,

It's really, really flexible on top of the time gained with each other. You have way more time for learning than you even realize. You're not blind.

Ela Richmond (18:51.022)
I'm curious how you schedule things. like, well, whenever you started, you had a couple of older kids and a couple of younger kids, right? How did you figure out where to begin with them and how much to start them on? Because there's always, or at least most families that start homeschooling talk about this period of like de-schooling where like, you have to remind yourself, like, I don't need them to sit in a chair for, you know, eight hours a day.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (19:00.339)
Mm-hmm, I did.

Ela Richmond (19:19.564)
I don't need to feel like we're doing something for this whole period of time. It doesn't have to be me dictating a lesson to them for every single subject. Like this period of like de-schooling where you kind of rewrite those rules inside of your head. Did you go through that as well? And then how did you find your family's happy medium for like what our schedule looks like?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (19:41.62)
love this topic because de-schooling is spoken about a fair amount and I am not a fan of de-schooling. Here's why. I'm not an advocate. Here's why. I know that kids function better when they're on a schedule and have clear expectations. They feel safer knowing what their boundaries are and where they should be going and what they should be doing. They don't have the social emotional ability.

Ela Richmond (19:50.721)
Interesting.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (20:10.291)
to manage their own details when they're young and they need guidance. So what I found is, and it's de-schooling, but also if you take too long of a break, it's a nightmare to get them back on track. Everybody's fighting and screaming and nobody wants to go back to doing grammar and math and sit down and do the work. It becomes a battle. And so I've had this discussion with many, parents who agree that even taking short breaks

is not worth the battle. So we may, if it's a holiday break, do a lighter load. We may just do grammar and then math one day, but we never stop. We rarely take a long break. And if you're coming out of a traditional classroom, that de-schooling period, I would describe it more as a mental mindset for a parent rather than a reset for a child. A child

Going into it, I often see as de-schooling means they're chilling at home. There's a lot of video games. There's a lot of playtime. And if you suddenly say, all right, let's snap back into it and get going on this essay writing today, they're not with you. They're not going to go along. So I don't typically recommend de-schooling. It can easily run into no schooling. But there is a transition of what does this look like?

My youngest like to wake up at nine. So we will wake up at nine, we'll go to our piano lesson, and then they'll get started on their work right before we do lunch. We're going to know that we have two hours of karate in the evening. And so I accommodate our school day that they're going to be doing some of their work while we're waiting on their sibling during that karate lesson. So that's an extra two hours that we're doing math or writing in the evening. The day is very fluid and flexible from that perspective.

but I don't typically stop.

Ela Richmond (22:14.166)
Interesting. Can you go more into that structure with flexibility? Because I think whenever I hear structure, it tends to get to the point where it's like, we're doing this and this and this and this and this way. And it sounds like you're not like that at all, you understand your kids' rhythms. Like you said, my kids like to sleep until nine, so that's what they do. And then they know that whenever they get up, here's what happens next. But...

I'm curious how you found that balance between structure and flexibility and does it start with you? Does it start with the kids? Does it start with you picking something and then adjusting as time goes on?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (22:56.297)
So it definitely was a transition when we started. For myself and my kids, I definitely had a mindset of, at nine o'clock we're gonna do math, at 10 o'clock we're gonna do science. And it's also very much child dependent. Some children need that hourly reminder. They don't do well with fluidity. And it also is seasons. So I would say when my oldest was probably in the fourth, fifth, sixth grade season,

She very much needed the time schedule. She needed that bit of pressure for her to get through because she could sit there and look out the window all day and do one math problem. mean, the time just passes for her. But my younger ones more easily get going. They just want to get the work done and get through it because they know we're going to move on to something else after it's done. And so it is child dependent, knowing how much rigor do you need in the schedule.

Some kids need to sit down every morning and they have to focus, you know, my oldest ADHD can be a real challenge. So knowing this is our chunk from eight until 11, every single day we do school that works for some kids and they need that. For others, we are not on that rigorous schedule anymore. My oldest has really developed her executive function skills and so we're more fluid. I use a scheduling tool that I schedule out

all of our lessons for the day, not by the hour, but for the day for the entire school year. It takes me one weekend to do that. That's something that I cover in the workshops that I host to help families understand how do I lay this out? How do I plan out and know what we're gonna do, how we're gonna do it, how long it's gonna take? And then you do find a groove. You do figure out, I don't recommend doing tons of activities when you first start because

There's so much fun to be had that you end up having to say no to way more than you can attend. But we also enjoy doing a lot of sports. We enjoy doing a lot of music and art and our friendship time. So I make sure that I have a good academic schedule and we work our day around that. Every day is different for my family. I teach classes two full days a week for portions of the year.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (25:21.987)
and on the semesters that I'm not teaching, then we're full force doing science labs. But on the semesters that I am teaching, there's no science labs going on because that's a big commitment during a day to get all the things out. Now, for other families, they're working parents. I have a lot of families who homeschool are using alternative learning that are two working parents. I have moms that their kids come and learn with me on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

and the other days they might take other classes. Part of the day they have blocks for their core learning at home, but it's really just managing the puzzle, putting the pieces together. And I get that question a lot too. I want to touch on that of how do I work and homeschool? It's not easy. It takes a high level of organization, but it's possible. I work full time, sometimes 50 to 60 hours a week.

but I make it fit in. The pieces are organized. My children know their expectations and it takes a high level of parent engagement.

Ela Richmond (26:29.486)
What are some of the tools that you rely on for that? So like you mentioned your scheduling tool, is that a tool that the kids have access to and can kind of see like, okay, this is what's expected of me. And then, okay, I was hoping so and I assume so, because it sounds like your kids are very bought into their own education as well. Like they're happy to know and happy to like get a head on at times and like they see the things that they need to do.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (26:39.708)
It is.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (26:56.009)
They know the expectation. Some days are easier than others. I mean, they're not excited like, yes, I can't wait to do that math book. No, but we know that with the fun comes the learning. And they know that's their job right now is to do the learning. So the scheduling tool that I love is Homeschool Planet. Now I started like many homeschoolers when they first start out with a paper calendar. And I quickly realized there are too many things that bump.

Ela Richmond (26:59.48)
For sure.

Ela Richmond (27:07.864)
Mm-hmm.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (27:25.061)
in this schedule and I found myself constantly erasing and moving and there was no way for me to quickly or easily move things out for the entire semester when we weren't going to duplicate lessons. It was so time consuming. Then I thought, well, I'm going to use an Excel spreadsheet because I'm a master at that and that seems easier. It was the same amount of work. It was not easier. It was not designed for that. I also tried Google Calendar and Google Classroom, not designed for this type of organization. Now,

My professional background is in user experience. So understanding when things work well and how to make them efficient is what I did for a living. And homeschool planet was absolutely the best tool that I found. If I say, what is the best thing that I spend money on each year? It's that tool. Now I just want to say, I'm not an affiliate. They didn't pay me to say that, but it is my favorite tool.

Ela Richmond (28:15.01)
Very, very cool.

Ela Richmond (28:21.208)
How do you set expectations with your kids? I feel like that is difficult at times. It sounds like that is kind of just the way that your family runs, that you've taught them from an early age that here are our expectations, here's what we do. But I would love a little bit of insight into that, because I think getting kids motivated to do the thing is very difficult for a lot of homeschool families. And I think something that is necessary is kind of this habitual

Like this is what we do, right?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (28:53.331)
Definitely habitual. mean, you have to be consistent and persistent in your message of this is what is expected. Also, using Home School Planet, each of my children have a login, so they can log in separately. They don't have access to change the schedule, but they have access to check off the work that they're doing, and that is their responsibility. Even my four-year-old logs into her schedule. She knows how to get on the laptop. It gives them ownership.

Ela Richmond (29:07.822)
Okay.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (29:21.577)
and have some skin in the game. So giving them visibility to the expectations, and I teach this to all of my students as well. I want them to be independent learners. I teach 130 middle schoolers. I tell them, it is your responsibility to own this, not your parents to remember what is due and how to do it. They're not here. They don't have the instructions. It's yours. And so I need you to own it.

and I need you to manage it, and I need you to do it. And I take that same approach with my kids in all of their learning. They can see they have full visibility to what's available. And the other thing is I don't just say, just do the next lesson in your book. That's not giving them a level of accountability. That's giving them the freedom to pass or take it. Having something assigned for that day is guiding them down the path of the real world. As adults, we have responsibilities every day.

If I don't take care of my responsibilities, one, I would lose my job or two, my family would not run well. We all have things that need to get done in a timely manner. It's important to get them going down that path and give them access to tools that allow them to see that early on. Now that sounds kind of tiger mom-ish, right? Gosh, this is totally orchestrated. However, when kids know what the expectations are, they have a visual to see it, which is extra important.

for kids with ADHD, then you can start coaching them on real life expectations.

Ela Richmond (30:57.282)
That's very fascinating. How did you do that when they were young? Like, sounds like you, I mean, it sounds like you're the kind of parent that probably did that when they were young as well. Did you?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (31:08.059)
Even my four year old logs in. And we don't do any online learning. So we use textbooks for our core learning and all of our subjects. But the online calendar, when I say log in, they log into Home School Planet. They look at the schedule that I've created for the entire year. They can see what they've completed and what they haven't. know, kids can be famous for, well, I did that math.

And maybe they only did one problem of the math. It wasn't checked. Or maybe they skipped two lessons and now we're on Wednesday, but Monday Tuesday wasn't done. They're going through Wednesday, but this gives them a visual of, oh, wait a second. That lesson from Monday, lesson 37 is still red. That's not done. Lesson 38 also is still red. That's not done. So I shouldn't be going on to lesson 39. I need to back up and start where I left off.

The other thing that I think is really important is teaching kids that this is not failure. This is not bad. You're not wrong or behind. It's teaching them to consistently move forward as independent learners. No one's in trouble for not getting a lesson done on Monday. Maybe we had a doctor's appointment and something came up. And so having that positive, optimistic approach also is vital to creating that level of independence and engagement.

They know they're not gonna get in trouble. They're not gonna be graded an F because it wasn't done or handed in, right? It's just a tool for them to know they're gonna stay on track.

Ela Richmond (32:45.646)
It's quite fascinating to me. The more that I hear homeschool families talking about their approaches to homeschooling, the more it becomes clear that there's a very strong correlation between the way you homeschool and the way you parent. And the way that your household runs and the way that your homeschool runs and the things that your kids expect.

know you expect of them and the things that in a school environment they expect and they know you expect from them. I think that's really interesting just like on a personal note for me thinking about how would I want to homeschool in the future. Like it is very closely linked with the question, how do I want to parent as well? And do you ever talk about that or do you ever like

Do you ever think about that in your own experience?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (33:47.422)
I think about that often because we're as a family unit, we're together all day, every day. So everything we do, you my kids are famous for saying, my mom's always about learning everywhere we are. If we're at a park, I will look at that, look at that insect. But now they're curious because I sparked that and said, what is that? What's going on over there? Let's look that up. Let's, you know, let's use Google lens and check it out. What is that? What is that leaf? What is that tree?

I am equally as curious, and I think if you are curious as an adult, it becomes enjoyable. Homeschooling is great fun if you're a curious parent. Now, it's not without challenges. It's hard. It's a really difficult endeavor to juggle and manage and fight the battles. Every one of us has battles. If I said my kids wanted to gladly wake up a new school every day, I would be lying. It's not that way for any of us.

That picture you see on Instagram of a beautiful Charlotte Mason family sitting and reading a book only lasted for three minutes. And then the baby started crawling away and the next little one started screaming and the other one had to go to the bathroom and that's not reality. That beautiful picture around a dining room table is not real. It's crazy. And by the time you have three kids, and I have many friends who have more, I have friends who have eight kids.

that are homeschooling, it's madness, it's chaos. And that's where the name, the Academy of Chaos came from. That was our original homeschool name, was the Academy of Chaos. Because, sometimes you're just in survival mode, and then, you know what, something will throw a monkey wrench, like your car breaks down, or someone gets sick, or everybody gets sick, or you have a death in the family, or travel, just all of the things that come as life.

However, I will say when that chaos ensues, this lifestyle of home education makes it lot easier to pivot. We have experienced all of those things during our home education journey. And, you know, when my mother-in-law passed away and we needed to travel, I didn't have to have that concern of, gosh, we have to fly because we can only miss 10 days of public school before

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (36:10.973)
We're going to get a truancy letter. No, we were able to drive, which was more affordable for my family. We were able to spend time as much as we needed. When my mother-in-law was in hospice and be with her, we were able to, you know, celebrate her life for the time that we needed together. We didn't have to rush. When we have days of illness, I don't have to worry and send my kids to school sick because I don't want them to miss a day.

because we're going on vacation for spring break, so I need to save those days. When my kids are sick, they're home sick. Now they're also kind of, no, I say, you're too sick to go anywhere, you better do some of that grammar, because you're just laying in bed. But I don't have to send them when they're unwell either. I think that's a big bonus.

Ela Richmond (37:02.582)
Yeah, that's amazing. You mentioned that that like pretty homeschool picture of like, you know, three kids around a table, all are happy, the whole world is peaceful. And like everybody wants that ideal. It's like the perfect ideal. Right. But that's never the reality. So as a as a homeschool mom that has gone through all of those challenges before, what is the best way to like help your

help your family get to a point where it's not perfect, but it's better most of the time.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (37:37.608)
Let me tell you what the beautiful looks like for me. The beautiful looks like for me when we wake up in the morning and we get to just have a gentle breakfast together. We don't have to hurry up, get your backpack, get dressed, the bus is coming, We don't have that. We get to casually eat breakfast, enjoy that time together and talk about, hey, what did you like about this weekend? Or this is the schedule for this week or this is what's coming up. It's also when I pick up my daughter from forest school,

Ela Richmond (37:41.567)
I would love to hear it.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (38:06.865)
and she gets home and she unloads her pockets and she has a pocket full of June berries that she wants to share because she snacked on them and she thought they were amazing so she brought some for everyone else. It's seeing my kids enjoy nature because we can go to a park and run around and they play in the mud and it's a hot mess but it's okay because we have time to do that. We can go home.

sitting and writing essays together, things that are really hard if you have a reluctant writer, but you can peacefully sit next to each other and tango as long as you need to do that. And we can go sit outside in the swing and do it together. That's the beauty in homeschooling. It's messy, it's chaos. It's not that picture that we think it is, but the beauty exists and it's amazing.

Ela Richmond (38:48.684)
Mmm.

Ela Richmond (39:01.518)
actually really love that visual that you paint because it sounds like it's not that you schedule your kids to the point where we have to go, go, go all the time. It's more so we have things to do. But like if there is something better or if there is a moment where we just want to pause, then we can. Like there is flexibility in our time. However, if it's the question of like, we're just going to sit here and like do nothing or we're just going to sit here and and, you know.

just like watch TV. It's like, no, we actually have things to do. Like we have places to be and things to do and check boxes to check off. Like you're never at a point where you're bored. However, if there's something like going outside and playing on the swings or for example, like eating a really slow morning breakfast together, like there is time for that too. And I actually really, really liked that picture. Cause I think it,

is more realistic, right? Like the go, go, go will burn out any homeschool mom at some point. And the kids a lot of the time. But I feel like that balance between we have things to do if you don't have anything to do, there is a list of things for you to do over here and you know where to find them. But also, but also like if we're at the park and we get like really immersed into something, that's what we're gonna do instead.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (40:28.529)
I think finding those moments of pause exist consistently. We were going somewhere last week and we were on a timeline, but my middle daughter saw an insect and she loves insects right now because she's in fourth school and they have nurtured that part of her, which I love. She said, I need to know what is this insect? And I was about to get in the car and I paused and I said, this is not a life or death situation. If we are five or 10 minutes late,

There are no consequences that anyone will be injured. So I stopped and I went and I looked and we used Google lens and we inspected the insect and decided what it was and talked about it on the entire drive to our destination. That's the beauty. We were doing all the things. Now my kids also, we love video games as much as the next and we tend to play games that are community based games.

where like we where everybody gets to play together or switch where everybody gets to play together. My kids love Wii Sports and that's fun, but they're never so bored that they need to sit there and play or watch TV all day long because those activities, those play dates, those sports, those art and music lessons, the things that are nurturing and pouring into them in the real world take a precedent and they've learned how to enjoy that.

Ela Richmond (41:57.422)
Do you kind of time box things as like a, I wonder, like as a guardrail? So for example, like we, like there's a time box of like an hour and then you have something else and it's kind of like a guardrail. Like if it goes a little bit over, it's okay, but also like you don't want them to play for five hours. And then just like, they're like, but mom, like we didn't know.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (42:20.947)
That is a dangerous situation with kids who have ADHD because it quickly becomes a dopamine seeking behavior. So when you use devices, and I'm not an anti-screen time mom, I think screens bring value and information, they are great tools, but when you have a student with ADHD, it can be very dangerous. If you are using that as a reward, it is probably the absolute worst reward.

Ela Richmond (42:28.396)
Hmm

Ela Richmond (42:47.201)
Hmm.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (42:49.071)
So adding a time box of every day you're gonna get one hour of screen time is a detriment. You're setting yourself up for a struggle and using it as a reward, even worse. Because if you're asking a kid, okay, I want you to do these dishes. I want you to fold your laundry. I want you to pick this stuff up and then you will get your reward of one hour of screen time. You are asking them to do the absolute worst job

Ela Richmond (42:57.409)
interesting.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (43:18.405)
in the shortest amount of time to get the reward that is going to give them the dopamine release that they want. And it's not a want, an intellectual want. It is a craving in their brain that they cannot control. And so I don't like to work within those constructs. I like it to be a pop-up surprise. Today, guess what? We don't have anything planned this afternoon.

Ela Richmond (43:26.081)
interesting.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (43:47.22)
Why don't we sit down as a family and let's play Family Feud or let's play Wii Sports Soccer or let's do the skiing game. I tend to also lean towards things that are learning focused versus individual play, things like Roblox, things like Minecraft, or isolating activities versus community activities. And what you select does make a huge difference.

Ela Richmond (44:13.09)
That's interesting. actually I love that perspective and I'm glad that you shared that. Is that the main way that your kids use technology is in like is in like a more of like the video game type of technology or like the TV type of technology? And then I'll ask you about like educational technology. like for video games and TV and movies and that stuff, is it like a they usually don't know it's coming and then I usually just say, hey, today we don't have anything like let's do this.

And like, obviously you're a neuroscientist and that's something that you really appreciate is understanding how the brain works with things. So that actually works better. You said for ADHD kids, does it work better for all kids?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (44:57.927)
In general, I think it does work better for most kids. I hate to say all because there's always an exception, but it does work better for most kids. It's a challenging reward to offer. It's a guarantee you can't always provide. And in my opinion, it's asking for a meltdown. So don't make that the choice. I always choose quality time over anything that's isolating.

Ela Richmond (45:00.522)
Interesting.

For sure.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (45:25.107)
From a learning perspective and from a what do we use technology for perspective, it's fun, it's entertaining. We're heavy users of technology in our house. We have all kinds of different, know, laptops, tablets, phones. We switch all of the things that everybody likes to use. But I love that I have set up this construct. And for me, I'd say the proof is in the pudding because

my kids, although they would love it and they would ask for it, it's not their first choice. They ask, can I go outside? When it's snowing, can I go outside? When it's raining, can I go outside? When they see that there's flowers blooming, can I go outside? They want to investigate something in real life. And what I know to be true for all of us, I will say, is that human connection is nurturing. It helps us grow. It helps us feel fulfilled.

It helps us have a positive outlook on life. It helps us have connection. It lessens anxiety and depression. It's a vital part of the way that we're designed. so seeing them lean away from the world of tech is important. They're healthier and happier because of that. Not to say we don't have it in our world. It's a part of our world that's here to stay.

Ela Richmond (46:49.272)
That's very interesting. we hopped on, you also said that you're very excited and fascinated by what tech and AI and the learning space can do as well. So obviously, you're not anti. In your family, it's not like, we tend toward books and nothing else. Obviously, that's not true. However, it seems like you have a really good grasp on it, and your kids do, as tech as a tool. And tech is not the very first thing that I lean toward all the time.

What are you most excited about in tech and AI for learning purposes?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (47:23.657)
For a long time, I have been very curious about the idea of technology as an intellectual prosthetic. So how do we use technology and really programs that are AI supported? And this is something that I've been talking about and thinking about for 20 years. This is something that has been on my mind and I've written about and I've integrated for a very long time from a cognitive

neuroscience perspective, but how do I use those tools to enhance what I already have? So the way that looks in education is when I teach, everything is executive function focused, developing a whole child's thinking, developing them to become strong problem solvers, to become critical thinkers, to become good communicators, to function well in public speaking.

and together as a team, all of those qualities are what are growing them to be the leaders in the future. Knowing how to use tech is a small part of that. It's important. A lot of people say, when do I teach my child typing? When do I allow them access? My four-year-old takes typing lessons. She types with all fingers. She's not a two-finger typer. It's important. It's part of our world. It's never going away. Very few of us are ever going to just go live off grid, right? And so,

to use those tools in the future. What is to come doesn't yet exist. What they're going to use in their jobs, the jobs they're gonna do, the world they're gonna live in does not yet exist. It is so rapidly changing and expanding and AI is in an infantile state, right? How do I create strong, wise humans that can then use those tools well?

To use AI well, what do we need? We need to write a good prompt. Doesn't just spit out the information, right? Someone has to write a prompt to gather what we need as a solution. And I teach these kids in my own how to use tools. Is AI gonna take away my job as an instructor? No. Is it ever gonna be able to, I love telling my daughter, you should be a plumber. Is it ever gonna fix the toilet? No, it never will. But.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (49:47.794)
It's going to be a tool that enhances all of those jobs. There are jobs that will take coding, likely it will overtake those type of roles, but someone is still always going to have to create what are the project requirements, what are the problems we're trying to solve, and that takes critical thinking. It takes communications. It takes being a strong writer. Those skills are always gonna be necessary, and that's what I focus on curating in education.

Ela Richmond (50:14.966)
Yeah, this is a fascinating topic for me as well, because I've seen a lot of friends of mine go through different periods of their life. And what AI has done in a lot of ways, even already in its infantile state, it's taken the beginner role. So for example, writing copy for things, writing code for things.

It replaces the beginner because it can do things very, very well, but it still needs somebody that can read and know what great looks like, right? Somebody that knows how to ask, write prompts. But I think what's really cool that I love about homeschooling, especially as this develops, is that normal students have to go a certain pace. And then usually whenever they get out of college,

they're just now getting into a workforce. They're just now getting experience with any sort of a field. But I feel like especially looking toward the future, homeschool kids will have an advantage with the fact that you can start learning about the thing that you're very interested in way early. And then that beginner status of like, well, we're just gonna write something. And most of the time in the past, least, beginners don't always write the best thing. Well, now AI can do that.

Right, and so you can just graduate to like an intermediate level or a little bit higher. And so it becomes a lot easier to be hired, especially whenever there are things that are competing with the beginner level. And I really, really love that. I have one final question for you as we wrap things up. So I am really curious to hear your perspective on curriculum. It sounds like you've chosen your curriculum very particularly that you care about different types of

approaches when it comes to the way that you teach your kids and the, you mentioned math as an example, like there are different ways of teaching math. What do you look for in curriculum that you will teach your own children and then also that you'll teach in your classroom setting where you're teaching 130 kids?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (52:32.605)
Well, I think the important thing to know about curriculum is how to recognize what is curriculum and what is practice. What is used for just enrichment learning versus what is an actual lesson and what is included in that. And that's one of the biggest things when I host my curricular library and I mentor parents and I do workshops is that they don't even know the difference.

Ela Richmond (52:40.782)
Mm.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (53:00.723)
They don't even know that it exists. They think any type of learning material is curricula. When in reality, curricula will include guidance and a clear lesson of how to, whatever it might be, math, writing, grammar, reading, comprehension, social studies, it will have a clear lesson. It will not just be practice problems. And one of the biggest challenges I find with parents who come to me,

They've been homeschooling for three or six or nine months and they say, it's a battle every day, Jean. They don't want to do it. They're fighting, they're crying, they don't understand it. I don't know how to teach it and help them. And then I say, bring the materials. Let's sit down and look at this together. And what they will bring almost exclusively is workbooks. And those workbooks do not have lessons. So it goes back to the idea of expectation with your child.

Ela Richmond (53:48.79)
Interesting.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (53:56.692)
Can you expect your child to complete algebra if you have not taught them how to solve the problems? You cannot just give them a problem and say, solve it. When you haven't given them the material to learn it, no one just learned by osmosis and knows it. It goes for every subject. And that is the challenge that I see is having that discussion of what is curriculum.

teaching parents to recognize it and discern what do you need. Do you need just practice or do you need something with lessons? And I go through that and help them know here's a visual of something with lessons. So when you're looking for something to educate your child, look for this. Now let's talk about your child's learning style. Is your child visual? Do they need clear visual models to help them progress?

That's something that's typically important for ADHD kids with ADHD. Do they need something that is spiral or mastery in any different subject? It could be different. You have a reluctant writer. You're going to want something that has very slow, repetitive lessons because they're going to need to build confidence. If you have someone who is an accelerated reader and writes very well and quickly, then you're going to have something that is mastery style and goes fast. You're not going to need a lot of review. The same applies to math.

But understanding the difference between what is a workbook, what is practice, and what is curricula to suit your child's needs, that's the first step.

Do you think most curricula does a good job of building on itself or no?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (55:42.92)
I don't think most curricula is necessarily intended to build on itself, nor does it need to. So let me give you an example. When my kids are learning writing, we're not going to use the same, there's not a K through 12 curricula that we're going to buy the same book and use every single year. There's a really great writing curricula that I love. It's by Thoughtful Learning, and their books are, it'll say grade four and five.

grade six and seven. And the way that I use that is in fourth grade, we will do heavy writing and we'll do light grammar. And that year is really focused on building and developing confidence, fluidity, understanding genres, knowing how do I write a research report versus how do I write a review versus how do I write a critical, thoughtful essay with opinions, growing that ability. And then the next year,

of its grade four five for that level, the next year we're not gonna do it. The next year what we're gonna do is we're gonna work on research skills. We're gonna be heavy in grammar. And so that is something that stands out as different from traditional classroom learning. Traditional classroom learning, every single year you're gonna be going through a spiral of the same stuff. That's because you have a group of kids who are expected to function in the average. You're not having custom education.

Ela Richmond (56:53.432)
That's very cool.

Ela Richmond (57:00.514)
Mm-hmm.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (57:08.253)
And so you're having the lowest and the highest going along the same path. You don't know who got it and who didn't. You really don't. But when I'm creating custom education for a small learning pod or my own children, I know exactly where they are. I know exactly what their challenges are. I know exactly where their ease falls. And then I can push them a little bit more or spend a little bit more time. We don't have to function on reviewing grammar every year over and over and over.

because I know they've got it.

Ela Richmond (57:41.254)
Very, very, very fascinating. What, as a parting note, I'll ask really quickly about places that people can find you. But before I do, where did you learn all the things that you learned whenever you were trying to, I don't know, figure out the best methods for you to go, the best pathway for you to build your children's homeschool journey? What are some resources that you'd recommend for people?

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (58:07.859)
Well, I list everything on my website. I found it to be fantastic, I list it there. I put it on my feed, on Facebook, on TikTok, on Instagram. My website is [theacademyofchaos.com](http://theacademyofchaos.com/). All of my social channels are by the same name. It's easy to find me. And if there are questions, I am always happy to be a support, be a mentor, be the friend that I needed when I started. How did I learn all of these things?

Ela Richmond (58:10.358)
Amazing.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (58:37.437)
thousands and thousands of hours of research and I hope that I can save a little bit of that time for someone else who's just beginning.

Ela Richmond (58:48.172)
This has been amazing. Everybody please go find Jean, go find the Academy of Chaos if you're interested in learning more. Go read up on those resources. I know I definitely am going to. And I hope that we see more of you soon, Jean.

Jean Lee, The Academy Of Chaos (59:01.674)
Thank you so much for having me today. This was a fantastic discussion.
