Morning, Charlie. I'm going to talk through the episode a bit. I haven't prepped anything, so yeah.

What's really fascinating about Peter Gray is that he's a biological psychologist who's very into research. He has a keen interest in education, child development, and anthropology—specifically how kids have evolved over time. That definitely frames his whole perspective on everything.

I asked him about the rise of anxiety and depression in young people. What's really interesting is he actually talked about how everybody's freaking out because it seems like there's this huge rise (and this is what his next book coming out next year is about), but there's actually not that big of a rise.

In the '90s, there was a spike that reversed the earlier trend. But pre-'90s, there was actually a large decline in children's mental health. He believes that decline has to do with the freedom kids were given before. During the industrial era—the era of industrialized schooling—children became much less free and parents started to have a tighter grip on their kids.

Then in the '90s, his hypothesis is that the computer came out. When computers first arrived, kids suddenly had a new way to be free and do things outside of their parents' grasp and control.

He talks about how this rise in anxiety and depression isn't necessarily new. What's also interesting is that he knows Jonathan Haidt, who wrote *The Coddling of the American Mind* (or something like that), where his perspective is that the issue is social media, phones, and all of these things. But Peter actually talks about—and this is really cool—how he and a ton of other researchers went to Jonathan and said, "Hey, all the things you're saying are true actually aren't." There's so much evidence that social media and all these things are not what's causing these issues. There are pros and cons to social media and being online, but the pros and cons kind of cancel each other out. It's not this huge scary thing that Jonathan Haidt made it out to be.

He cites the fact that the UK and the US are the only two countries that have the issues we do with a decline in children flourishing, even though every other country also has access to social media. He cites a lot of studies throughout, and I thought that was awesome.

He talks about how school has evolved and what it used to be. He discusses the difference between the relationship where a parent feels like they need to build the right education and basically create who their child is going to be, versus uncovering who their child is and helping them become more of that.

He talks about the concept of cultural myths—things that, because they've been the way we've thought about them for two or three generations, we feel like we've always thought that way, even though we haven't.

He talks about self-directed education, why it's valuable, and cites a lot of evidence for its value. I came back at him and asked how effective a kid is if you completely unschool them for a long time. He had a really interesting perspective as a professor. He said that every single college professor teaches their subject as though you forgot everything you supposedly learned in high school. It's much more important to make sure your kids are capable of being independent, self-reliant adults.

OK, part two. He talks about safety. Most parents' perspective on "Should I just let my kid do their thing?" is to cite safety—"Well, this world isn't safe." He goes into that, and one of his takes (especially from the book) is to choose your community wisely and make choices that make it easier to give your kids freedom.

I think there are a few really strong potential angles we could dive into. One could be this perspective that social media is not actually the enemy, and that computer games are actually real play. Yes, they're addicting, and yes, we don't necessarily want to push our kids to get addicted to these things. But for kids to play games online with their friends—it actually is valuable to kids. It's not detrimental to their health. It is a form of play, an actual form of play.

So that's really interesting. We could go into the cultural myth that social media is the problem. If we want to get a little spicy with it, we could do that. If we don't want to get spicy, I think we could just hammer home Peter Gray's mission, his usual message: here's the purpose of childhood, here's the purpose of parenthood, and here's a lot of evidence to support it. I think that could be really great.

He mentions a couple of things. One phrase that stuck in my mind is this idea of "parenting"—not "parenthood," but "parenting." It's taken this relationship (parent-child) and turned a noun into a verb. He says that suggests the role of a parent is to be much more active in fixing everything and deciding things for your kids. Like, parenting is "yes, no," as opposed to—I think I'm saying this wrong, but I hope you get the gist—parenting as a thing, versus seeing your relationship with your kid as a true relationship. You have a kid who is a person, an adult who is a person, and they're both making each other better in different ways. The parent is doing all they can to uncover who this little person is and help them become more of that. And the child, unintentionally but 100%, is helping the parent become more of who they are by testing patience and all that stuff.

The relationship aspect of it—he's like, you don't call it "partnering" with your significant other. It's a relationship, and you just recognize that naturally.

I don't know. I think those are two different ways we could go about it. If you listen to it and think something else stands out, definitely let me know. It's a very research-heavy conversation. He explains a ton in there and it's kind of heavy, but it's cool as heck if you buckle in for it.

## Rough Transcript

# Peter Gray Episode

[00:00:00] **Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella, and today my guest needs absolutely no introduction. Peter Gray is here. He is the author of this amazing book, free to Learn, um, which was published in 2013, I believe. He is a bi biological psychologist. So he goes into all kinds of the background of education, how children learn, um, why play makes children happier, and the types of play that are really, really important for children.

So today we're gonna get into a really fascinating conversation. Welcome to the podcast, Peter.

[00:00:34] **Peter Gray:** Happy to be here. Thank you for inviting me.

[00:00:37] **Ela Richmond:** So I, whenever I first started reading your book, I was absolutely fascinated by the fact that you actually wrote it. A long time ago. Right. And we are starting to see a lot of the effects of the things that you were writing about and you were saying as an example, right?

Anxiety, depression, like all of these things are the result of children, um, not having the right type of an education, [00:01:00] not having the right type of a relationship with, um, freedom. So can you speak to the fact that like you were writing all of these things more than 10 years ago, right? Um, what did you see back then and like now with the perspective of having written the book, been in education for a long time?

Like what is your perspective now? Is it kind of fascinating to see all of the things that you predicted would happen and you started seeing happen, like coming to fruition, but like in such a drastic way?

[00:01:29] **Peter Gray:** Well, I think a, a lot of people have the mistaken belief that this rise in anxiety, depression, even suicide among young people is new.

It's not new. It has been going on since the 1950s. Ever since about 1950, there has been a continuous rise in anxiety, depression, suicide among young people. [00:02:00] So by 1990, so this was well before I wrote my book, by 1990, the rates of anxiety, uh, depression were somewhere between, if, if you look at, uh, the data that has been analyzed from.

Questionnaires that, uh, assess anxiety and depression given the normative groups over those decades. School age kids, people have analyzed them and if you use the scores to make an a, a judgment of what would likely be diagnosed as major depressive disorder or a clinically significant anxiety disorder, the rates of those disorders increased by somewhere between five and eight fold.

Between 1950 and 1990, the rate of suicide among teenagers increased fourfold over those, over that, that, [00:03:00] uh, 40 year period. Interestingly, those rates went down a little bit.

[00:03:07] **Ela Richmond:** Interesting.

[00:03:08] **Peter Gray:** They're getting at 1990, they went down between 1990 and 2000, and then they. They didn't go all the way back to 1950s levels, but they went about a third of the way back, a significant decline almost.

Nobody pays any attention to that. We all notice when things bad happen, but we tend to ignore when something good happens. So those rates got better for a period of time. They stayed sort of level at this somewhat reduced rate between 2000, 2010. Then around 2010, they started to go up again and that most recent increase, that's what people talk about as the evidence for this, but people aren't aware.

Those rates today are not any higher than they were in [00:04:00] 1990.

[00:04:01] **Ela Richmond:** Interesting. And

[00:04:02] **Peter Gray:** we had a decline, and then we've had a raise up again. So, um, so I was primarily focusing and free to learn on what had happened in the second half of the 20th century. I, I have to admit that even though I was somewhat aware that things had at least leveled off when I wrote free to learn, I did not talk about it and nor did anybody else.

It seemed like at that time it seemed like, well, maybe this is a blip and we should just ignore it. It doesn't, I, I don't know exactly how to explain it. Other people aren't writing about it, so I kind of ignored it too. But I've realized more recently that I can't ignore it. It's too big a change. It's a real significant change and it occurs in every measure of psychopathology.

And, um, and so I have now written about it and then my do book, I talk, I do talk about, I talk about this whole curve. Why did [00:05:00] my new book isn't yet published, but the manuscript is done. I talk about not only the rise in, why did things get worse between 1950 and 1990? Why did they get better between 1990 and 2000?

And then why did they start getting worse again around 2010?

[00:05:20] **Ela Richmond:** So fascinating. Are you willing to give us a little sneak peek into that?

[00:05:23] **Peter Gray:** Sure. So between 1950 and, and 1990, so I, in one of my chapters of my new book, I summarized something like 11 or 12 different social changes that occurred over that period, all of which had the effect.

Of reducing children's outdoor freedom, schooling increased greatly. The amount of time kids were spending in school increased. Uh, for example, this school year, uh, the amount of weeks of [00:06:00] school increased by five weeks between 1950 and, um, and about 1990, um, the school recesses were already being cut down by 1990 from what they had been earlier on.

Homework in the 1950s, 1960s, kids were not given homework. Uh, maybe in the beginning, in the 1960s, to some degree they were, but in elementary school, there was no homework in the 1950s. Once in a while, a teacher might ask. Children to write a poem or a story at home, something fun. But kids did not walk back and forth between school and home carrying workbooks and homework.

And parents weren't involved in homework. So when kids were outta school, at least for elementary school kids, they were free. And secondary schools, people had study hours. And for the most part, you could do your assignments during study hour. But there was some homework, there's no question, there was some homework.

Uh, even in [00:07:00] the, even in the, uh, second half of the 20th century, uh, in high school. But not nearly as much. And school wasn't nearly as big a deal. The, um, the other thing that changed between, um, over this period of time, some of the other things that changed, one of them was simply television that came into being, and most families got televisions in the 1950s.

And, uh, by the 1960s almost all families with kids had television. And television brought kids indoors. They, instead of staying outdoors after school to play until dinner time, kids came home to watch the Mickey Mouse Club on television. Mm-hmm. Um, and uh, so that played a role. Um. Sports. So, you know, when I was a kid in the 1950s, what sports was, was that you would go out to the vacant lot or the street, depending on where you lived, or [00:08:00] maybe a playground, if there were, was a playground in your neighborhood and there'd be a bunch of other kids that would show up and you'd create your game.

And this was real play. This was kids creating their own play. Beginning in, although we, although Little League officially started in 1938 for baseball, it didn't really become a big thing until, uh, the 1960s. And then there was also. Adult run leagues for all sorts of other sports, um, hockey, football, uh, soccer, uh, basketball and so on.

And parents seemed to believe that this may be better for their kids than just going out and playing on their own. And so they would encourage kids to do that. Kids liked it too. Uh, many of the kids did. But that meant that instead of just going out and making up their own game, which is real play, which is creative, and which you're learning how to solve problems, you're learning how to take control of your own life.[00:09:00]

You are in something that's basically like school.

[00:09:03] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[00:09:04] **Peter Gray:** It's run by adults and the kids are basically pawns in it. They're being told what to do, their problems are being solved. They don't have to learn how to get along with one another. 'cause there's a coach taking care of all that for them. They don't have to figure out how to make up rules.

'cause there's an who's got the rules there. Mm-hmm. So we replaced free play increasingly with adult directed activities over this period. Families got smaller over this period, began to beginning. Uh, and, and as families got smaller and there were fewer kids outdoors to play, that also reduced the incentive to go out and play as families had fewer kids.

And as houses got bigger, houses gradually became bigger. There was less incentive for parents to kick their kids out of the house. And, um, and as, as we reached the point where many kids had their own [00:10:00] bedroom, you know, they could get away from, from the, from the ruckus of the house by just going into their bedroom.

They didn't have to go outside to get away from it. Mm-hmm. So all of those kinds of changes occurred reducing the opportunities for children to, to really be children, which is to play and explore and solve their own problems. Get into trouble, figure out how to get outta trouble. All the things that children.

Need to do really to grow up. Mm-hmm. Those opportunities were reduced. So then the question is, what happened beginning in the 1990 that made things better? And I've looked, I've thought through every possibility, and there's one, only one answer that makes sense to me, and that is the development of the computer.

By the interesting what? By the, by the early 1990s, [00:11:00] the majority of families that had teenagers had a computer. By the mid 1990s, not only did they have a computer, but they had an internet connection. We had pretty much taken away already. By 1990, we had pretty much taken away. Children's freedom to spend lots of time playing and exploring outdoors, hanging out with one another.

Outdoors away from adults, away from adults is a key part of this. Because kids really to be free to be kids, need to get away from adults. So we had pretty much taken that away by 1990. Now kids had a new way they could do it on the computers, they could play computer games. And computer games are real play people.

Adults wanna demonize them. But the truth of the matter is this is real play. And the kids enjoyed them. They, they're creative, they're [00:12:00] interact. Once you had an internet connection and they were multiplayer games, they were interactive. And so I went back and reviewed the research from those times, and the research is unequivocal those kids who were on computers and playing computer games, even if you control for background factors like socioeconomic category and so on.

We're doing better psychologically than those who weren't on computer games. So, and this was, this is true for every age group. It's true for young kids as well as for teenagers. So the computer was kind of a saving grace. And the other thing to keep in mind is for in, for households, for people who are as old as I am, who are old enough that you had a teenage kid in the house.

Mm-hmm. At that time, the teenagers were the ones who figured out how to use this stuff.

[00:12:53] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[00:12:53] **Peter Gray:** And they became the computer experts. So they gained a new kind of level of. Respect and [00:13:00] competence. You could walk into department stores in the 1990s into the computer section of department stores and who would be selling the computers, explaining them to middle aged adults.

What these, what you do with these contraptions, it would be, it would often be a teenager, so teenagers glommed onto this. It was in some sense, the wild west to explore. There was all kinds of new possibilities. This was exciting for teenagers especially, but younger kids too as they got into it, and so now they had a way of playing, exploring, interacting with one another, the early forms of what we now call social media chat groups and so on and so forth.

Mm-hmm. This now became a way that kids could hang out with their friends. They could spend the time that they need with their friends, which they were not so much allowed to do outdoors or away from adults at at that time. There was a study done [00:14:00] by a woman named Dana, boy, uh, Boyd, BOYD, um, around the time, uh, in the very early 21st century.

So we're still in the very early stages of computer use and the very beginning of, of what we now call social media. And she crossed the country interviewing teenagers, um, everywhere, several hundred teenagers about why they're on social media so much. And the answer she got over and over and over again is, this is the only way we can get together.

Without adults in our face. And so, uh, so she documented also this, this was, uh, kind of saving grace at a time when many of them said, oh, you know, we'd love to be able to get together in person, but there's various reasons why we can't. One is that even if I am allowed out by my parents, my friends aren't all allowed out by my parents.

Secondly, it's becoming harder and harder for us to [00:15:00] find a place to be where we're tolerated, where the, where teenagers are accepted as a group. We became a society kind of afraid of teenagers. We didn't like teenagers to gather together on street corners or in diners or the kind, or even in shopping malls as time went on, as, uh, as they had in the past.

So, so those things, um, those things. Those things had happened, but now teenagers have this new way online of getting together. So I think that accounted for why things got better between 1990 and 2000 and they remained kind of better. Uh, this doesn't completely replace the value of getting together in person and outdoors.

It's not as good as that, but it is better than not being able to get together at all and better than not being able to play at all much better. So that accounts for that change. And what accounted for things getting worse? [00:16:00] Uh, beginning around 2010. Now the story that a lot of people wanna believe, which I do not believe.

Is that what accounted for getting worse is social media that the iPhone became increasingly popular. Kids were kids, had smartphones. They were on smartphones a lot. And it's very tempting for adults to look at kids on smartphones and say, oh, they're addicted to it. Mm-hmm. Or, this is why they're not getting together in person is because they're spending all their time on smartphones or they're.

Involved in social comparison. They see how beautiful their friends have made themselves look. Mm-hmm. And so they, by comparison, they feel bad. This whole story that has been around for a while is not supported by science. Uh, the scientific research does not support this story. There have been actually literally hundreds of studies looking at correlation between smartphone use, social media use, [00:17:00] and mental, uh, health among young people, uh, which all in all show no, no meaningful correlation.

Some studies, so a little bit of a positive effect of, um, social media use and smartphone use on mental wellbeing. Some show a little bit of a negative effect. If you combine them all, they tend to cancel one another out. There have been multiple reviews that, uh, and meta-analyses showing. If you bring all the studies together, you get basically a null effect that clearly there are some beneficial effects of all of this and some potentially harmful effects, but they kind of cancel one another out.

And there's no interesting overall evidence at all that social media is the cause of the rise in anxiety, anxiety, depression. Now, one of the lines of evidence against it is that it's the United States is not the only [00:18:00] country in the world where kids glommed on to smartphones and social media. This occurred in the United States, and it occurred in, in two or three other countries, well documented in two or three other countries, but it did not occur in most countries.

[00:18:16] **Ela Richmond:** Interesting.

[00:18:17] **Peter Gray:** In all of the European Union, it did not occur. It occurred in the uk, which is actually not part of the European Union, and I have an explanation for why it occurred there, but it did not occur in the eu. Over the same period of time, between 2010 and, um, and about 2018 or 2019 when this all began to level off in the United States, over that period of time when there was this fairly steep rise in all, in, um, in anxiety, depression, suicide among, among young people in the United States, there was actually a decline, a small, a small decline of all of this in the European Union.

Even though kids work [00:19:00] onto smartphones and social media every bit as much there as they are here. So, so, um, so I don't buy that argument.

[00:19:11] **Ela Richmond:** Interesting. Um,

[00:19:12] **Peter Gray:** I don't buy that argument nor does. Anybody else who actually does research in this area. I don't do research in this area, but I'm good at reading research and I've reviewed the studies that have been done.

I talked to Jonathan Hyde before he published his book, and I said, this does not fit with with the actual science. But he, what did he say

[00:19:33] **Ela Richmond:** to that?

[00:19:34] **Peter Gray:** He, uh, ignored me and, uh, he went on, you know, he, instead of the, the people who really do the research have, are actually somewhat angry about this book because Interesting.

He ignored them. You know, he acted as if there had been no research done and his, the only research was done that was the few studies that had been [00:20:00] collected by his graduate student who he hired to collect studies that support his thesis. So it's a very cherry picked set of studies. There have, there have been numerous, there have actually been dozens of meta-analyses of that and by people who do this research and that, and you don't, you won't find references to any of that in his book.

And so Interesting. So, and so it was a, and so, you know, so people who aren't. Sophisticated about this, read the book, and they think, well, here's this scientist, a well-known scientist, a public intellectual who is telling us that the science tells us that this is destroying our children's mental wellbeing.

And, and we have movements to take smartphones away from kids for, for because of this. So this is, um, this is, uh, this is a, you know, there's a long history of this, which I've written about on one of my substack, and they're actually [00:21:00] books on this. Um. Uh, a long history of, of what are called moral panics about, uh, children's choices of media.

So, you know, way back in the Victorian era, the, the moral panic was about what are called, what, what in the UK were called Penny Dreadfuls. Cheap novels, thrilling novels, uh, about murders and all this kind of stuff that were available cheap enough. You could buy them in, presumably for a penny in, in, uh, England.

And they were called dime novels in the, in the United States. 'cause you could buy 'em for a dime here. And kids were glomming onto this. They were even learning how to read by reading these things. And the adult felt this was terrible, that this was leading, that this was the moral corruption of the young 'cause they were reading about all this stuff.

So we went through that era. Later on it was movies. When movies became [00:22:00] a mo motion, pictures became available. There were serious panics about the corruption of the youth watching these movies that had, you know, romance and murders and so on in them, and depicted a glamorous life. That was, uh, this was during the depression period and the United States.

So of course people wanted to dream about a more glamorous life, teenagers included. Um, there were books written about how terrible this was for kids. And then, so we'd gone through this with, then it was, there was then it was comic books a little bit later on. Mm-hmm. Then it became computer games. We're pretty much over that now.

And then it became social media. So this is a long chain. Whenever the kids glom onto something new, we think this is gonna, in some sense, be the destruction of this next generation of people. And the adults sort of get on a bandwagon to try to ban it, to take it away from [00:23:00] kids. But then by the time that those kids who are doing this, by the time they become adults, then it becomes an accepted part of the, of everybody's understanding.

That's interesting. And, and the panic is over.

[00:23:14] **Ela Richmond:** Interesting. So I wanna kind of like. Dive into this, this idea of, um, what, what's actually important, right? So like you've, you've mentioned media and the fact that like right now there's this, there's this craze and scare about social media and that being harmful for kids, right?

Um, but your book talks a lot about the things that are necessary to make our children happier, more self-reliant and better students for life. And I think you have a very interesting perspective as well, because as a biological psychologist, you're very, um, focused on evolution, right? Like the purpose of evolution is building humans that can learn and adapt and grow and like continue forward and progress.

Um, and something interesting about the the industrialized school system is that it is [00:24:00] not. Helping kids progress or build those skills to progress or adapt or grow or make decisions for themselves. It's much more creating children that can operate inside of an existing model. Right. Um, and, and you've pointed a lot to the fact that that is something that creates anxiety and depression and, and like, maybe we have it a slightly wrong, like we are, we're pointing the finger at, at social media, we used to point the finger at movies, we used to point the finger at, you know, certain books and like, um, maybe that's not the culprit.

And I'm, I'm curious from your perspective, like what is the most important thing, so if a parent has, you know, decided like, I really care about my flourishing as an adult. Right. You also have talked about, um. The fact that as parents, we've gotten into this mindset of resume building for children, right?

And like, and, and that as a pervasive mindset that we need to make sure that they have the best opportunities and that they're extremely accomplished by, you know, the time that they go off to college and that, you know, all these things. [00:25:00] What is the most important, like first building block for parents?

[00:25:04] **Peter Gray:** Okay, so the, so children really the, let, let me, let me back up just a little bit For sure. The, the purpose of childhood, the purpose for all mammals really, of the juvenile period is to become increasingly independent. So mammals, and this is especially true for human beings, are born dependent on their parents.

They can't just run off and be themselves. Mm-hmm. They're absolutely dependent on their parents from the beginning. Totally dependent. But the purpose of the extended childhood has become to increasingly independent children need time to do things by themselves, to interact with other children away from adults.

So they learn how to get along with peers without an [00:26:00] adult governing them. They need to be able to do more and more things on their own without an adult, monitoring them, guiding them, telling them what to do. So over time, in modern times, really, and I'm speaking really over time, ever since the 1950s, we have been increasingly taking those freedoms away from children.

So the children are more or less being monitored and directed and controlled by adults all the time.

[00:26:37] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[00:26:38] **Peter Gray:** Now, I just described. A way that children escaped that for a period of time on the on computers and so on and so forth. Children are always looking for a way to escape that. But what has happened over time, and here's how school figures in school figures into the increased anxiety and [00:27:00] depression and suicide in two ways.

One way is it takes so much of children's time that they don't have time to just. Daydream, figure out what they wanna do, hang out with other kids, play, explore, discover who they are. They're spending so much time doing what adults are telling them to do, not just in school, but also in adult directed sports and other kinds of things that are adult directed.

They're spending so much time doing what, what oth what adults are telling 'em to do that they don't have time to just. Figure out what they honestly really like to do. You need lots of time to play and explore and discover what you like to do to discover who you are, to learn how to solve your own problems.

So part of it is school. As we, as [00:28:00] we devote more and more time to school, we're taking more and more time away from children's opportunity to be children. But the other thing that happens with school is it, it has become, over time evermore an immediate source of distress to children.

[00:28:18] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[00:28:18] **Peter Gray:** We have, we have convinced children that how they're doing a school is a measure of them.

That they are constantly being. Being judged. They're constantly being assessed. They're, they're being compared to others. They're being made to feel like, if I am a failure at school, I'm a failure as a human being.

[00:28:43] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[00:28:44] **Peter Gray:** And it's no surprise that every year, this has been true for a long time. Every year, the rate of suicide and the rate of admission into [00:29:00] mental hospitals, emergency admissions for pediatric mental health emergencies plummets.

It goes way down. Every summer, school closes and the kids are doing better. School opens up and it gets worse again, it even plummeted during the COVID lockdown, suicides, anxiety, depression, mental health, admissions, all went down. They didn't go back up again. Even when schools opened online, they didn't go back up again until school opened up in person.

School is a direct cause of anxiety and depression. I said before that there are some countries that, like the United States also showed an increase in anxiety, depression, and suicide. One of them being the uk and they are countries which, like the United States underwent a major so-called reform in education in our country.

It was common core, which [00:30:00] initiated a co, uh, so-called common curriculum that limited what teachers could do in the classroom. Mm-hmm. By way of accommodating to children's real needs. And there's no question, but what school became far more anxiety provoking as a result of Common Core than it had been before?

It was already anxiety provoking, but it became more anxiety provoking after Common Core. I'm convinced that it's the initiation of common Core that led to that spike of, uh, interesting anxiety, depression, suicide that began around 2010. That's when Common Core began. It was in full effect in most states, either common core or similar thing by 2013.

So over that period of time, school became more stressful. Every study in which you ask children and teenagers what's stressing them out far and [00:31:00] away, the leading answer they give is school. Far away. Yes. The things that we like to think are stressing them out are way down the list.

[00:31:10] **Ela Richmond:** Like social pressures and social media.

It's cool. That's

[00:31:13] **Peter Gray:** stressing them out. And that's true across social class. It's true for rich people, kids. It's true for poor kids. This is what, this is, what they say is the cause of their anxiety, depression. So for example, in 2013, the American Psychological Association did a survey. They do a survey periodically called Stress.

In America, usually they only include adults. But in 2013, they included teenagers. Teenagers were, came out as the most stressed out people in America in that study. Wow. And when they, there was a checklist of what you could check that's indicated. What, uh, what is, what is the main source of your stress? 83% Check school.

Nothing [00:32:00] else came close. Nothing else came close to that. So we, as a culture, we would far rather blame social media mm-hmm. Than blame school. School has a halo around it.

[00:32:14] **Ela Richmond:** Why is that?

[00:32:15] **Peter Gray:** We don't, we don't think we can. Well, that's a really good question. And, and it, why, why is it that it doesn't? I think that there are a number of reasons.

One is that historically we have had school now for several generations. So all of us went to, almost all of us went to school. Our parents went to school. Mm-hmm. Probably our grandparents went to school. It has been part of the cultural myth all along. Mm-hmm. That school is essential for, for, for growing up.

We also know that. You know, [00:33:00] historically and even today. People who drop out of school, we call the, the people who are dropouts of the school don't do well, uh, in the world. Mm-hmm. But they're more likely to become homeless. They're more likely to be, be, uh, involved in crime or to be involved. So we tend to look at that and we tend to say, well, school must be saving people, you know, and, and there's a certain sense in which that true.

You can't just put people out on the street and expect that they're going to be fine. That's the typical dropout. But what I've shown in my research is if instead of dropping out, you are sort of dropping up, up, you are leaving school for something different from school, but still is something that you see as positive, which is self-directed education.

Uh, whether it's in a school for self-directed education, where children can follow their own interests and be supportive for following their own interests or at [00:34:00] homeschooling by. A method that in which children are in charge of their own curriculum. We see that children do far better in those situations, but that's relatively new and most people have not, uh, have not come to understand it yet at this point or encountered it.

More and more people are however it's beginning to happen.

[00:34:22] **Ela Richmond:** I, I find it interesting the, the phrase you use cultural myth, because I actually think that that is a huge concept. Like it, there's this, there's this, um, almost like a, a, a, a tendency right? To believe that it was always that way because for a couple generations it's been that way.

Um, and so like we have a really hard time questioning the way that school is and the way that we've done it and the way that we structure it and all these things because it just seems like it is so obvious. Why would that be the thing that's wrong? Right. Um, I'm curious your thought on I, so I know that there's a difference between, [00:35:00] um.

Like putting kids, for example, into a ton of experiences like a piano class, a math class, a science class, and even in, in sort of like a self-directed education, right. There, there are ways that people are building self-directed education, quote unquote, but they're still, instead of, um, allowing their kid to play on the piano as free play, right.

They're putting them into a class and that's, that's how they're packing their schedule. Right. What's the difference there, and like how as a parent do you determine what should be, if anything, structured versus what should be free play? Um, as a, as a thing that the kid leads.

[00:35:38] **Peter Gray:** Right. I, I will address that question.

Let me just say one more thing I wanted to say about school and that is that one of the re one of the things that has happened, the changes in school. Certainly from the 1950s until now have been gradual over time. Mm-hmm. So we've gradually added more [00:36:00] days to school. We've gradually added more homework.

We've gradually increased the test. We've gradually taken away recess, remo, reduced recess. All these changes are gradual. So parents don't see them as big changes. It's not what my kids are doing. They would say, it's not all that much different from what I did. This is, this is what society is. This is, so, if you had, back in the 1950s, if you had, if somebody had proposed, okay, so we're gonna change schools, so we're going to, we're gonna mm-hmm.

Instead of having two hours outdoors every day, an hour of recess, a half hour of an hour of, of lunch, period to play outdoors, half an hour of recess in the middle of the morning, half in the afternoon, you suddenly said, we're gonna only have 15 minutes of recess.

[00:36:48] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[00:36:49] **Peter Gray:** Nobody would've allowed that.

Mm-hmm. You can't do that to kids. People would say, if suddenly people said back then when, [00:37:00] when kindergartens were kind of optional, if exist didn't at all, if you said, we're gonna give homework to kindergarten kids. Mm-hmm. People would've said, that's crazy. These were just little children. Mm-hmm. The purpose of kindergarten is to learn how to get along with other children, to hear stories, to play games.

It's not to be that we shouldn't be sitting them down with worksheets at five years old. Then if somebody said, well, what about four year olds in preschool as we're doing now, people would've just thought you're crazy. That's, so we have made these changes gradually over time and people have accepted it is normal, uh, because it's been so gradual that, that if somebody had proposed those changes, suddenly there would've been a rebellion about it.

[00:37:56] **Ela Richmond:** That is so funny and true.

[00:37:58] **Peter Gray:** So that's what I wanted to say about that. But, [00:38:00] but so the other, the question that you were just asking now, so a lot of the problem is exactly that, that we have, I think part of the problem right now is that so many parents are obsessed. About their, not only about their child going to college, but the idea that their child should go to a fancy college, to an elite college.

I don't know why parents wanna pay the most they can possibly pay for college. Why? Why don't they just want 'em to go to the local community college or the state college? It's just as good and it, but anyway, that's a sub. So be partly because of that, partly because of this belief that it's sort of almost parents' job.

To get their kids into, uh, an elite college. And the belief is that to get into that elite college, you not only have to do, have perfect [00:39:00] grades in school, get into all the honors classes, do all these extracurricular activities and excel in them. But you also have to be, you have to be in all these to show you're well-rounded.

You need to be doing these other, you should be taking music lessons. Mm-hmm. You should be doing, you know, whatever it is, studying, whatever it is. And so kids get, get assigned into so many different things that. Not aside from homework, they're spending time on all these other adult directed activities, and of course, kids to some degree buy into this.

Mm-hmm. I mean, kids are not impervious to the cultural beliefs. They begin to believe that if I'm going to succeed in life, I've gotta do all these things. Is also the case that in terms of, in terms of say, adult directed sports. It's also the case, it's almost true that if you want [00:40:00] to get into, you know, have friends in the physical world that you're gonna see every day, where are you going to find them?

You almost have to find them by being part of an adult directed activity because mm-hmm the, you're not gonna just go out to the vacant lot or the shopping mall and find them as you once did. So a lot. So kids who wanna get, be part of other kids and have friends with other kids, sometimes almost the only way they can do it is to join a sports team or to join some other kind of adult directed activity where at least you could sort of play between the cracks.

You can be sitting on the bench and playing with your friends on the bench while you're waiting to get into the game. Uh, so, so, so kids get attracted to it to some degree, but. To a large degree, they feel pressured to be part of it. And they feel like this, just like they feel that it's important that they do in school.

They begin to feel it's important that they be in these [00:41:00] extracurricular activities and adults are, are encouraging them to do it and in either subtly or even un subtly pressuring them to do it. The result is that kids are in far more scheduled adult activities mm-hmm. Than they should be in and they don't have time to do things themselves.

What I tell to parents when I talk to parents is that it would be a good idea to talk with your kids about, so you're in all these activities and you, and you know, I see that you're really busy all the time and you don't have a lot of time to do things that you yourself might like to do. Are there some of these things that you feel you could give up?

And if adults took that approach, I think there's a chance that most kids would say, oh yeah, I'm really not into competitive swimming. [00:42:00] You know, I could give that one up, or I could, or that was, or those music lessons. I know you would really like me to learn the piano, but I'm not at all that into it to tell you the truth.

And so I think if you could have an honest discussion with your child, you might find that your child really isn't so interested as you might think they are. Uh uh, or even as they might pretend they are, if you could have an honest discussion about it. The other thing I suggest is one way to tell what your child really cares about and doesn't care about is to make them responsible.

[00:42:38] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm. For

[00:42:39] **Peter Gray:** remembering. When they have to go to this event.

[00:42:44] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[00:42:45] **Peter Gray:** If you have to remind them, then chances are they're not really that interested. If, if they're really interested, they'll remember. So one way to do it is to say to your kids, so. I'm, [00:43:00] I'm not going to take responsibility to be your calendar and your reminder.

That's not my job. That's your job. And, um, if, if it's true that I have to drive you there because there's no way you can get there by yourself, I'm willing to do that, but you've gotta remind me when it is rather than the other way around. And that's one way to see how interested they actually are in it.

Because if they really are interested, they'll put it on their calendar. They'll remember it. They'll remind you as the parent that this is coming up and would you please take them to it if they can't get there on their own?

[00:43:36] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm. The

[00:43:37] **Peter Gray:** other thing I think parents should be doing is, is encouraging their children to get their on their own in any way that they can.

Whether by public transportation, walking, bicycling, this is part of growing up is being able to. Have, have independent mobility, outdoors. Um, and uh, and that's something that has. That has [00:44:00] largely been lost in our culture. I mean, kids always, even kindergarten kids used to walk to school. And nowadays even, even teenagers are not walking to school.

Mm-hmm. So they ought to be walking to school and uh, or bicycling to school if it's too far to walk or pa or taking public transportation. Uh, if there's not a school bus and it's that far away, the idea that parents have to drive their kids to school, it's, uh, I see schools around here and all these cars are lined up, spewing fumes into the atmosphere.

They're wasting a huge amount of time. They're polluting the atmosphere. And meanwhile, the kids could be getting fresh air and exercise just walking home. And most of them live close enough to walk home by any reasonable stretch they could walk home. That so interesting. Home. Certainly bicycle home. So it, we're not doing anybody a favor.

By driving them everywhere. So these are some of the things that I think parents could be doing much more of to give their [00:45:00] children more opportunity to be outdoors and do things on their own.

[00:45:05] **Ela Richmond:** Yeah. This is so fascinating. What do you believe the, the role of a parent is? And then how does that evolve as they get older?

Because I know that in the work that you've done, you've showcased a lot of different cultures and how different cultures give responsibility to younger and younger children. Um, and they do actually see that younger children are capable, they are independent, they can make choices. What do you see, especially in our modern society, what is the role of a parent and like, how does that evolve?

Because it's a lot easier to, to ask your kid, you know, what do you want to be involved in when they're say 10 as opposed to when they're three?

[00:45:39] **Peter Gray:** That's right. Well, so first of all, I would say that the role of parents. In children's lives, uh, should decline with every year that the child grows older.

There's no question about what an infant needs a lot of attention and needs a lot of parental involvement. There's no [00:46:00] question about that. By the time a child is four, the child is capable of a lot more independence already by the time of four already. By the time of two, the child wants to do more things by themselves and can do more things by themselves, but they still need to be watched two year, two year olds and three year olds.

I would not send them out to run errands by themselves to, but four year olds can do it. I did it at four. I was I, when I was four years old, I lived with my mother and grandmother. My mother was a single parent, single mom at that time, and my grandmother and my mom worked full time, and my grandmother was somewhat crippled.

And at four years old, she would send me, we lived on a busy street in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She would send me two blocks away. To buy of all things cigarettes for her. That's, this was funny. A long time ago's, right? So four year olds at that time, at least I, and, and [00:47:00] I'm not sure that all four years, but certainly by five kids were out there doing things like that.

They would, they could run errands for their parents, they could do things in hunter gather cultures. I did studies a few years ago, not directly unfortunately, living in a hunter gatherer culture. I didn't have the opportunity to do that. But by surveying anthropologists who had the general belief among hunter gatherer adults is that four years old is sort of a turning point when children have common sense.

When children don't need to be watched all the time, they can run off with the other kids, they can do things. They're not gonna do stupid things anymore than any of us do. We all do stupid things, but the, uh, but they're, but they're capable of understanding rules. They're capable of thinking about things.

They're not, they're not gonna. They're not gonna run off and get lost in the woods. They're gonna, they're gonna have enough sense not to do that and so on by about four years old. It's interesting to me also in this regard that [00:48:00] I've been very long involved with a radically alternative school called the Sudbury Valley School.

Mm-hmm. Where children are not watched, uh, they're free to roam around the campus and in the woods as part of the campus, and. So on without adults following the realm. And the youngest children they will accept is four because they don't believe three year olds generally are capable of managing themselves, but four year olds are, even four year olds have to have a visiting week to show that they're capable of managing themselves at the school.

In fact, every new student has to have a visiting week. 'cause there are teenagers who aren't capable of managing themselves too, are gonna, or are gonna do things that violate the school rules or even state laws on campus. And they can't tolerate that. So you've gotta, so, but the point in really making is there's a, there's a shift at four years old and there's even, there's even laboratory research showing that children by four years old have [00:49:00] generally internalized language well enough that they're capable of thinking verbally, which means they can remember.

Uh, rules. They can remember, oh yeah, mom said don't touch that hot stove, or Look both ways before I cross the street. They're capable of remembering and following rules and guiding themselves that way. So, so there is that. So, so inre, the point I'm making is increasing the overtime. Children should have more and more independence, more and more opportunity to do things on their own in this world today.

I'm not gonna tell parents to send your 4-year-old out to buy cigarettes or anything else because no parent is gonna do it and somebody might even call nine one one very likely would call 9 1 1 if they saw a 4-year-old walking down the street with no adult with them. We are in a different world, but I would tell them, you know, your 8-year-old ought to be [00:50:00] walking to school.

Your 10-year-old certainly should be able to do some shopping for you. Uh, your, and, and it will be good for them to do that. They will, they will feel proud about doing it. It will be a grownup sort of thing to do. They will be happier, they will have a greater sense, a, a less fear of becoming an adult because as they're growing up mm-hmm.

They're doing more and more adult-like things.

[00:50:28] **Ela Richmond:** Yeah. Something that you've mentioned before. So I, I think

[00:50:30] **Peter Gray:** what's happened with parents, so it's traditionally, of course, the role of parents is to feed the child, to house the child, to, uh, love the child, which should come pretty naturally. Uh, comfort the child when the child needs comforting.

We have taken on, parents have taken on the additional job of managing the child.

[00:50:58] **Ela Richmond:** Interesting. [00:51:00]

[00:51:00] **Peter Gray:** And that is not. That should not be part of the parent's job. The children should be managing themselves. Parents should be helping the children when the children need help and managing themselves. But parents have taken on the task of manager where they're, they're sort of telling the child what they need to do and, and enabling the child to do the things that the parent has decided they should be doing.

They become the child's manager. That's not a good parent child relationship. It often puts the parent and the child at odds with one another. The parents, I think that, I think that the way parents should think about children is it's at least once they're beyond the age of four, and this might sound like a little bit of an exaggeration, but begin to think about your child the same way [00:52:00] you might think about your spouse.

Your job with your spouse is to be in relationship with that person, to help that person when they need help, to care about that person, to love that person, to understand that person and help that person meet the needs that they wanna meet, to be a partner with that person in that way. And if, if parents could think of their children more in those terms.

This is a relationship. This is not a job. It's sort of a job. When it's an infant, there's almost no way around it. Changing diapers is a job, right? I mean, that's, but once the child is beyond a certain age, instead of thinking of it as job, instead of thinking of parenting as a job, think of it, thinking of being a parent as a relationship, as a child, adult relationship.

And how do you, how do you make that relationship a really good. Loving and caring [00:53:00] relationship. A two-way relationship. Respecting the child, respecting the child's needs for privacy, just like you would respect your spouse's needs for privacy. You know, your spouse would object if every time they came home from work.

You wanted a detailed report about what happened at work. Your spouse would rebel if you tracked them digitally as they went out. This would be an invasion of privacy. You would not want that from your spouse. Your spouse would not want that from you. You need to be respectful and trusting of one another.

And I think the same is true between a parent and a child. Certain, certainly beyond a certain age with the child that children need their independent, they need increasing independence, they need respect, they need to be understood, rather than to then for parents to act as if. The child is, is really incapable of making good [00:54:00] judgements.

There are with, if you have that kind of a two relationship, your child will ask you for your opinion. You don't have to, and then you don't have to present your opinion. If your child needs your opinion, wants your opinion, they will ask you.

[00:54:16] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[00:54:17] **Peter Gray:** But if you give your opinion too often, they will avoid asking you.

They don't wanna hear more than they are asking for.

[00:54:27] **Ela Richmond:** This makes sense. They wanna run

[00:54:28] **Peter Gray:** their own life.

[00:54:29] **Ela Richmond:** This makes a lot of sense. And I think it ties back to what you were saying earlier about like the, the ego that is, that is tied up with parenting and also like university and getting into elite colleges.

It's like this fear of failure. So you're going to manage so tightly to make sure that they're successful, quote unquote by, by somebody else's standards. Um, right. And something that I, I love that you said in the book and would, I would encourage anybody to read it, is, um, like this whole safety question, this whole safety thing, like, oh, but it's not safe.

I don't feel like I can let my children walk [00:55:00] to school. I don't feel like I can do all these things. There are a lot of like very practical solutions. So something that you said as a, as an example is like, make sure you choose your neighborhood wisely. Like if you can, like, make sure that you know, you have chosen a place where you can make these decisions to allow your kid to have freedom or go and meet your neighbors.

And like, how can you build a world where you are not as afraid of it so that you actually can give your kids these, these, um, very necessary things. Um. To do and to build independence. My my last question for you, um, and again, I'd encourage anybody to read the book and whenever your new book comes out, we would love to share it with our, with our whole, um, with our whole audience and everybody that reads newsletter and all that stuff.

But, um, what is your perspective on per personalities? So like we've talked about the Sudbury Valley School, we've talked about like different types of self-directed learning, and I have chatted with a lot of people who philosophically completely agree with the fact that it would be amazing if all kids were self-directed and took control of their learning.

But like, [00:56:00] um, they have had kids where they have gone so unstructured that it's actually been negative for the kid because a kid needs more structure, like the kid's personality needs more structure. Um, do you think personality plays a role in that? Do you think it's like something that wasn't maybe built as a foundational element early on or like, I don't know, what is your perspective on, on that as like a choosing.

Education models are choosing the right path for a specific kid versus saying like, okay, this is gonna suit all kids.

[00:56:30] **Peter Gray:** So what I, when I hear about, so some children are more self-motivated than others, and the question is, well, self-motivated for what? And by self-motivated is the parent made? This child is not self-motivated to learn how to read.

Uh, this child is not self-motivated to do the things I want the child to do. Or is the child truly not motivated to do anything? Is the child just sitting there doing nothing? Is there, is it even possible to sit there and do nothing? Have you ever [00:57:00] seen a truly self-motivated 3-year-old or 4-year-old, uh, that that's not self-motivated?

You know, they're all self-motivated, they're always doing things. Watch any baby. They're always doing things. They're always, they're curious. They're playful. They're trying to figure out the world. So. So I think that when we talk about the the non self-motivated child, I think there's two things. We could be, two things that could be referring to.

One is when children reach school age. And they are constantly, their own questions are no longer important or respected, and play is regarded as a waste of time and disruptive. So the things they're motivated to do, their motivation is being suppressed, and instead they're being told you have to do what we adults are telling you to do.

I think [00:58:00] you can, at least for some people, you can kind of quash the self-motivation, you know, curiosity and playfulness can kind of be quashed by, by too much suppression of it too many times telling you that's a waste of time. We can't, we don't have time for that. This is what the lesson is. So I think that we kind of can.

Create, um, people who are, who, who don't trust their own ability to make decisions about what to do. The other, um, the other thing, uh, that's, that relates to self motivation is the, is as I said before, self-motivated for what. Mm-hmm. And, um, and I think that if one wants to take the educational track that I advocate in the book, free to learn, and that I've been involved in studying and have done further studies of, since one [00:59:00] has to be very, um, trustful of children, that if your child isn't, isn't reading at five or six or seven or even eight years old, you have to trust that eventually your child will learn to read.

I have never seen a child in self-directed education who hasn't learned to read. They all learn to read, but they learn to read at different times. They're not all motivated to read at age six or seven or eight. Some they're, some kids are motivated to be out climbing trees. Then some kids are motivated to be creating art or music.

Then it doesn't involve reading. Some kids are motivated. Some kids these days are quote, reading, they call it ear reading, where they're listening to books. Uh, they're listening to audiobooks or they're, they're exploring other ways of learning. And so sometimes what people mean by not self-motivated is they're not [01:00:00] self-motivated to learn the stuff that they would be being taught in school, if they were in school.

And so I think that that's the thing that one has to, if, if one wants to. One wants to take a self, you know, uh, allow your child into a self-directed journey for education. You have to be trustful. You have to believe the data from many studies now that children will eventually learn the things that are important for them to learn to live a meaningful and satisfying life.

That's the, and, and, um, every, I, I really don't, I really, it would be interesting for people who believe that somebody's not self-motivated to define exactly what it is that they mean by not self-motivated.

[01:00:54] **Ela Richmond:** That's very interesting. And, and the

[01:00:56] **Peter Gray:** other thing in terms of structure, people talk about structure.[01:01:00]

Structure of course is important for all of us, but we, but society creates structure school. Sudbury Valley School, which is a school for self-directed education, is not lacking in structure.

[01:01:14] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[01:01:14] **Peter Gray:** So, for example, there are lots of rules at that school. The rules are all made democratically by the democratic school meeting.

And so there are rules that you, none of the rules have to do with learning. The rules have to do with just rules of behavior, things you can and cannot do on campus. You, and there's a lot of rules. So this is a, this is not anarchy, this is a rule by law, but democratically created law at the school. So.

There's that kind of structure involved that there's limits on what, on what you're allowed to do. You can't do things that harm other people. You can't litter without picking up your litter. You can't take something out without putting it away. You can't, [01:02:00] certainly can't break state laws by using illicit drugs or alcohol on campus.

There are all kinds of rules like that, so it's not anarchy. And the other thing is that when children are playing, play is always structured. People talk about unstructured play, but there's no such thing as unstructured play. When children are playing, they're playing at something, and that at implies structure.

They're building a sandcastle, that's a structured activity. They're having a play fight. That's a structured activity. You're pretending to fight without really hurting one another. Whatever children are playing at is structured and when they play, the way children learn how to structure their activities is by, um, by playing at by, by playing in a way that requires structure at all.

Play requires structure, and in social play you have to agree on the [01:03:00] structure of what you're playing. Mm-hmm.

[01:03:02] **Ela Richmond:** We're,

[01:03:02] **Peter Gray:** you know, we're pr, we're playing that we're going to the king, to the ball at the king's castle, and you're creating the structure in your head of what you're going to be now acting out.

[01:03:15] **Ela Richmond:** This is very fascinating. Um, so I'm gonna hit you with a couple rapid fire questions to, to close this out. Um, I am very fascinated, everything that you've been saying, I've been like nodding along to it's, it's very aligned with all the, all the research that you shared and was very fascinating to hear about your new book.

I cannot wait to read it. Um, how would you recommend people look into more research about self-directed paths? Because I think a very common experience is, um, you know, you, you, we all went through the experience of here are the important subjects to learn. I'm gonna teach my kids that these are also the important subjects to learn.

And that the mentality that your kid's gonna learn what is valuable for them to learn, period. Um, and like that, the trust that's associated with that as opposed to [01:04:00] like. We, we send kids through math classes and science classes, and lots of times they don't even learn anything in them. They're just checking boxes, taking tests, and going through them.

Right. Um, but it's still this like pervasive cultural myth, uh, to use your words like, um, that we need those things. Do you have any like readings that you, or podcasts or people that you'd recommend people look into if they're kind of interested in that?

[01:04:24] **Peter Gray:** Well, so, um, one of the things that I have written about on my substack and, and my blog and, but reviewing other people's research as well as my own research is that I think what parents worry about if their children aren't learning, uh, kind of on the school schedule and learning school things, I think.

The primary thing they're worried about is that they won't be able to go to college. Um, I don't think anybody believes that [01:05:00] they're learning in school things that are really important for daily life because they're obviously not, they're not learning in school thing. It used to be that schools offered more things that had to do with daily life.

There were shop classes, there were home ec classes. Unfortunately, they were sex segregated, which they shouldn't have been. We should have had men in ho, boys in Home Ec and girls in Shop, but it didn't back then. But the, uh, but the idea was that you're kind of, uh, helping to educate kids for life. But I think we've, I think now schools are almost entirely oriented towards what they call academic education.

The goal of which is to prepare them for college, the ultimate goal of which is to prepare them for college. Now here, the thing that I learned in my very first study of the Sudbury Valley School graduates, so it was done long ago, and I described this study in the book, free to Learn is that you don't have to do any of that stuff and you can still go to [01:06:00] college and you can still do well in college.

That was the most surprising result to me, and it was one of the main reasons I did that study. My son had had become a student at this school and I was considered, well, what if he wanted to go to college? When he graduated from that school, would he be able to, so I did a study of the graduates and there were some of the graduates who had never been to a typical school.

They had never taken what we would call a school course. They had never taken an exam until maybe they took the SAT exam, which they prepared for. Then they went on to college, they got into college and they did well in college. Once they were there as a college professor, it doesn't honestly surprise me that they can do well once they're there.

And one of the reasons it doesn't surprise me is most kids graduating from high school, even from fancy high schools, even if they got all As, don't [01:07:00] remember what they learned in high school. Anyway. So every class starts pretty much from the beginning anyway. Mm-hmm. So the introductory biology class does not assume that you remember any biology from high school biology.

They start from the beginning, maybe go at a higher level or a faster pace than high school, would've been a more intellectual develop. But they don't assume that you know anything. If they do assume that you might know something, it's easy. And I learned this from the, from the, from the kids who had gone on who had not taken previous courses.

It's easy to catch up. You just, you know, you just, so this term, so that professor used the term, um, my myosis, so I don't know what miosis means. So I look it up. Now I know what miosis means, right? So, and in this day and age, it's all the easier you can be sitting there in class and take out your smartphone and look it up.

Ah, okay. So I haven't even fallen behind in this lecture. I understand entirely [01:08:00] what myosis means.

[01:08:00] **Ela Richmond:** There you go.

[01:08:01] **Peter Gray:** So kids who have learned to take responsibility for their learning. Are a big advantage in college and the kids who have been involved, taken responsibility for their learning throughout in self-directed are really at an advantage in college because they do take responsibility and they're in college for a good reason.

They don't, they're not in college because their parents have forced them to go to college. They're in college or not, because they think everybody has to go to college. They're in college for a real reason, and they wanna get the most out of it because they've decided themselves to go. And that makes a huge difference.

So I think that that one of my, one of the things that I've sometimes emphasized in talks is what the research shows. First of all, this is not entirely true in other parts of the world, but it is definitely true in the United States. Anybody can go to college, [01:09:00] anybody. There are colleges who will take you and it doesn't matter that much what college you go to.

One of the things that sometimes happens with some kids who are graduates of self-directed education is they go first to a community college, a two year college. And the two year they'll take anybody low tuition, some places free tuition. You go there, you take some courses there, and you use that transcript to go on to a four year college if that's what you wanna do.

Anybody can do that. Mm-hmm. And um, and that's and a reasonable step. The other thing is that there's actually research that truly, this was done long ago some time ago, or started some time ago. This is longitudinal research that has to occur over time. In which what these researchers did, and the the research team that I'm thinking of, one of them is an economist and the other is a [01:10:00] statistician, and they did the, they did the statistical equivalent of creating identical twins.

So let's, I, let's basically identify people who by all background, by all background characteristics, are as similar to one another as we can make them. They come from economically similar homes. They score similarly, uh, uh, they, they have similar, um, similar IQs to the degree that one can assess iq, but E and uh, and let's look at the difference.

Let's look at whether it matters whether they go to an elite. A college, it's hard to get into, or they go to a col, like the local branch of the State college. State university. It [01:11:00] turns out when you do that kind of matching, there's no overall benefit of having gone to the elite college.

[01:11:07] **Ela Richmond:** Really?

[01:11:08] **Peter Gray:** That's really true.

No overall benefit,

[01:11:11] **Ela Richmond:** even not even relationships.

[01:11:13] **Peter Gray:** Even by, even by, um, by the measure of how much money you're making at age 40, which is a common index.

[01:11:22] **Ela Richmond:** Wow. Even

[01:11:23] **Peter Gray:** by that, certainly not by relationships. Certainly not that, I mean, you, you, you are, you are as likely to make friends, maybe more likely to make friends in the.

Less stressful, less elite college than uh, but so there are advantages. So there are advantages and disadvantages to the elite college, and I think the reason that there's no difference is that the advantages and disadvantages tend to cancel one another out. That's my interpretation of it. So you go to the elite college and you are more [01:12:00] likely to make connections.

With other kids who come from wealthy families mm-hmm. Who may be able to connect you to their parents and their parents' businesses.

[01:12:12] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[01:12:13] **Peter Gray:** You are more likely to find recruiters looking for you to recruit you into their law firm or whatever. Mm-hmm. Or if, uh, this is more true for students than undergraduates, but you're more likely to have that.

You're more like, so you have those benefits. On the other hand, you go to the less a elite college and you have the benefit of what researchers call the big fish in the little pond effect. You stand out, there you go. If you are, if you are the kind of person who could have gotten into, uh, a more elite college, but didn't you stand out in this other college as a really top student?

And the professors notice that, and [01:13:00] especially if it's a college that doesn't have graduate students, you know, you get invited to work with the professors, you get invited to collaborate with them. You get almost treated like a graduate student. Those professors are gonna write great reviews for you.

You'd have been just one of the run of the mill at the fancy college, but here you are, you're kind of a star at this college. You have more of an example. I'm giving that example, but that's true all the way down the line. If you're sort of a mediocre student. Somehow you make it in the Harvard, you're, you, you, you're kind of one of the failures now.

Mm-hmm. You feel like you're a failure, but you go to the other college and you feel like I'm okay. You know, I'm just like other people. I, I, you know, it affects your self-esteem. It affects your own image of yourself and what you can do. So there's a lot of research showing that what, what is called academic self-esteem goes down when you go from a place where, [01:14:00] from, from, from, say a high school where you were one of the top students to now a college where.

You're kind of just average, that makes so much sense, less than average. It really affects your, your self-esteem, which then also affects your performance. It lowers your, your aspirations in some degree. Mm-hmm.

[01:14:18] **Ela Richmond:** This is so fascinating, um, and I'm, I'm really glad that you tackled this because I think you are correct in a, in your analysis that what parents are afraid of is what happens next.

Like, will my child be successful? Will they be able to get into college? What, what is their path? Am I opening the right doors for them? And like, parents usually want the best for their children. So they have this innate desire to open as many doors as possible and create as many opportunities as possible.

Um, and what's funny is like, like. Sometimes that the answer's not necessarily controlling everything, it's actually letting go. Um, and like that's a lot harder. Um, do you have, uh, a list of books that you'd highly recommend people read if they're [01:15:00] interested in learning more about education and children and, um, and they're in the midst of trying to build something that's right for their kids or like help guide them in the right direction?

[01:15:12] **Peter Gray:** Uh, well there, you know, so, so there's, there are quite a number of books that would be relevant. One book that I kind of regular suggest to parents is, um, Allison Niks book that The Gardener and the Carpenter. Do you know that book? Um, so Alison Gonick is a leading developmental psychologist who studies the cognitive abilities of little children and.

Publish these amazing, you know, children are so much more logical than we think they are and able to solve problems and so on and so forth. But she wrote this book that is re aim, really aimed at parents called The Gardener and the Carpenter. And she said, she talks about sort of two different approaches to being a parent.

The carpenter approach is the [01:16:00] approach of that. You're sort of sculpting your child, you're creating, you're building your child, you are your child is your product. Just like if you were a carpenter, baking a table or a chair, that would be your product. And, um, and she argues that this is the wrong way to think about being a parent.

You can't build your child. Your child just isn't buildable. Your child is gonna resist that. You're gonna be disappointed. You can't, you can't, and you can't have a sense. You can, you can have a sense of like. If you're a carpenter and you're building something, you can have a sense of an image. This would be the perfect chair that I wanna build.

But that would be a terrible mistake to say, this is the perfect child that I wanna, that I want my child to be. Um, first of all, the chair doesn't respond negatively to that kind of pressure, but the child does. So the, uh, so the gardener approach to being a parent is the approach that says, [01:17:00] you know, children, just like all biological things, have in their DNAA plan for growth, a plan for growing up, a plan for development that's in their DNA, and you're not gonna affect that.

You could fight it and make things worse for the child, but what you wanna do a, as the gardener approach is just provide the fertilizer.

[01:17:27] **Ela Richmond:** Mm-hmm.

[01:17:28] **Peter Gray:** That helps the child grow the way they are going to grow. And there are personality differences. And part of the job of the parent is to recognize that, that my child is not the same person that I am.

My child has, you know, a random selection of my genes and a random selection of my partner's genes. But this is a whole different person. This is not me, it's not a replica of me. People talk about reproduction. They're not reproducing themselves. [01:18:00] They're producing an entirely different creature. Mm-hmm. An entirely different human being.

And the job of the parent is to learn who that person is and to help that person be who they are rather than to try to decide what that person should be. Now I'm, I'm, uh, I'm sort of elaborating on Niks point using some of my own language in this. But that's her point. And she makes a very effective case that, um, that really the job of parents is to be in relationship with their child, to understand who their child is and to provide what their child seems to need, rather than what they, or society is somehow telling them they should be foisting on their child.

Wow. She, she also tackles, she's the one who says, she points out that the word [01:19:00] parenting as if it were a job. Was in non-existence prior to about 1970. Nobody talked about parenting. Interesting.

[01:19:08] **Ela Richmond:** I didn't know that.

[01:19:09] **Peter Gray:** Yeah. I didn't know it either, to tell you the truth, even though I was around line before that, uh, it became a popular phrase as people began to think of being a parent as a job.

She says, we shouldn't use, you know, I can't get away from parenting. It's so much in our vocabulary. Mm-hmm. I use it, I even use it as title in my titles to things, but she says, we shouldn't talk about parenting our children any more than we talk about wifeing our husbands, or husbanding our wive. That's funny.

We should think of it as a relationship. And, um, and she's very effective I think, in talking about that. And she's coming from, she's coming as one of the top researchers, uh, academic researchers in child development to talk to parents. There's another [01:20:00] book, which I can't, I, um, maybe you know the title of it.

I'm having difficulty right at this moment, thinking of the name of the author. The title is something like, uh, how to Raise the Adult. And do you know this book? And it's by, I think so it's by a woman. Uh, and I should know her. I've even been on a, on the same, um, same programs with her. It is by a woman who was formerly the dean of Stan, Dean of freshmen at Stanford University.

Looked it up. So this is somebody,

[01:20:32] **Ela Richmond:** it's Julie. This is somebody, this Hymes.

[01:20:35] **Peter Gray:** That's exactly who it is. That's right. Okay. There you

[01:20:37] **Ela Richmond:** go.

[01:20:38] **Peter Gray:** And so she's talking about her experience as the dean of freshmen. So here Stanford is of course one of the elite colleges. Mm-hmm. And parents would love to get their kids into.

And so her experience as Dean of freshmen is that so many kids were suffering and so many kids were not prepared for college. Not because they weren't [01:21:00] academically prepared, but they weren't emotionally and developmentally prepared. They weren't prepared to live independently. They didn't know how to take care of themselves.

They didn't know how to deal with real life without an adult there standing over them. Because they had been so overprotected and so she says in her book that this experience working with freshmen at Stanford, coming from these privileged families and who had sort of given them everything was, I'm gonna, I'm gonna with my own child or children, I don't remember.

If he has more than one, I'm gonna change the way I, uh. Interact with, with this, I'm going to insist that they do chores around the house. I don't wanna send them off to college, not knowing how to make their own bed or clean their own room, or if they're living on campus, how to cook. These are important skills and they are [01:22:00] as important as at least as important as what they're learning in school.

So I'm gonna, I'm gonna, and I'm going to put less emphasis, I'm, I'm not gonna worry about their academic performance. I'm gonna be more concerned with their development as whole. People who feel comfortable within themselves, who know what they wanna do, who if they do go to college, have a reason to go to college.

[01:22:25] **Ela Richmond:** This is so good. I'm gonna, um, note both of those down and, and read both of those books. Um. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I know that people can read your, your writings a lot on Substack. You're pretty active on substack, which is such a gift. Um, and so people can follow you there. Is there anywhere else that people can follow you and how will, other than Substack, um, do you have a date for your new book publishing?

[01:22:49] **Peter Gray:** Yes, I just learned, uh, I'm somewhat sad to learn that the publication date is not until September 29th, uh, of this coming [01:23:00] year, 2020, oh, no, six.

[01:23:01] **Ela Richmond:** So

[01:23:01] **Peter Gray:** my manuscript is done, but they go through a process that takes about a year. So wow. Close to a year, about nine months. Um, it still has to be copy edited. That won't take long, but I think there's a time, I don't know exactly all what goes into the publication.

It's a big publishing company, and I'm not, I, I'm not, not in a position to argue with them about that. So, so it's not until then that the book will be published. Um, but, um, meanwhile, you know, much of the ideas are in some of my substack posts. The other thing that people can get access to, I have a personal website that is just at, uh, peter [gray.org](http://gray.org/).

Dot org. So it's an easy, uh, URL to remember and, um. You can download there. Um, yeah. Almost most of my academic articles, or many of my academic articles are available as PDFs there. [01:24:00] And I write in a way though, even though they're published in academic journals, I, I think that they're very readable by anybody who can read, you know, they're, I don't use a fancy language and I always write in a way that is, I'm aiming to try to commute, to communicate with anybody who really wants to understand mm-hmm.

What I'm saying. So don't be put off by the fact they're published in academic journals. You can find, for example, my studies have grown on schoolers that show that they can go to college. My studies of those graduates of Subbury Valley School, my, that's amazing. I have a, have a chapter. Uh, published in the, um, Oxford, um, Oxford Encyclopedia of, uh, of educational research that is a chapter on self-directed education that was an invited chapter.

So people who are looking for the actual [01:25:00] published peer reviewed research on what is possible for children who grow up with self-directed education can find my articles, which also review other people's work in this area, uh, at that, at that. That's amazing.

[01:25:16] **Ela Richmond:** Well, we'll keep all of the links, um, kind of in the descriptions and then also we usually publish an article as well.

And so we'll make sure that everybody can find those 'cause, um. You are a very, very good writer and very uniquely, as opposed to many, um, many academic writers. You write very, very approachable as well. So I, I always appreciate that.

[01:25:40] **Peter Gray:** I always attribute it to not knowing very many big words.

[01:25:46] **Ela Richmond:** Well, this is so fun, Peter.

It was so great chatting with you, and thank you so, so much for coming on the podcast and sharing your thoughts.

[01:25:53] **Peter Gray:** Thank you for having me. It's been a pleasure.
