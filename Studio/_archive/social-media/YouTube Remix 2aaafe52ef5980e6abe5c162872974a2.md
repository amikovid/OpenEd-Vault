# YouTube Remix

Text: The content outlines a structured process for creating educational video clips, specifically "Punchy Shorts," from YouTube transcripts. The steps include extracting transcripts, identifying hooks and supporting segments, and providing text recommendations for editors. Key requirements for the clips focus on maintaining source integrity, using direct quotes, and adhering to specific time lengths for hooks (5-15 seconds) and supporting content (30-90 seconds). An additional snippets bank can be created for supplementary quotes. The format for the clips includes a title, hook with timestamps, supporting content, and optional additional snippets. The content emphasizes the importance of clarity, logical flow, and standalone coherence for each clip.

# Guidelines

**YouTube Recuts ("Punchy Shorts")**

- **Sources**: Education thought leaders (Mike Rowe, Naval Ravikant, Adam Savage, Gary Vee, Codie Sanchez)
- **Process**:
    1. Extract YouTube transcript
    2. Run through Claude "Punchy Shorts" project
    3. Identify hook + 3-5 supporting segments
    4. Create on-screen text recommendations
    5. Send to editor with timestamps
1. Upside: We’ve had some bangers see here: https://www.tiktok.com/@unstandardizedgenius/video/7493709540093971754
- Downside - we don’t actually own the content

# Video Editor Instructions for Creating Educational Clips

## General Requirements

1. **Source Integrity**: You can only use direct quotes from the original video. No adding words, changing phrases, or altering what was said.

2. **Editing Tools Available**:
   - Cutting (removing sections)
   - Rearranging (changing order of clips)
   - Jumping (skipping from one timestamp to another)

3. **Clip Components**:
   - Hook (5-15 seconds)
   - Supporting Content (30-90 seconds total)
   - Additional Snippets Bank (optional extras)

## Hook Requirements

The Hook must:
- Be attention-grabbing and concise (ideally 5-15 seconds)
- Establish the main point or argument being made
- Be clear enough to stand on its own
- Include exact timestamp from the original video
- Be powerful enough to make viewers want to watch the rest

## Supporting Content Requirements

The Supporting Content must:
- Directly expand on or elaborate the hook
- Provide necessary context for understanding the hook
- Flow logically from one segment to the next
- Include exact timestamps for each segment
- Total approximately 30-90 seconds
- Form a coherent message when combined with the hook
- Be able to stand alone without requiring prior knowledge

## Additional Snippets Bank

The Additional Snippets Bank:
- Contains relevant quotes that didn't make the primary clip
- Includes exact timestamps for each snippet
- Provides alternative or supplementary points
- Can be used to extend or customize the clip if needed
- Is organized by topic or relevance to the main clip
- Is optional material that could strengthen the clip but isn't essential

## Example Format

```
CLIP TITLE: "[Descriptive Title]"

HOOK:
"[Exact quote]" (xx:xx-xx:xx)

SUPPORTING CONTENT:
- "[Exact quote]" (xx:xx-xx:xx)
- "[Exact quote]" (xx:xx-xx:xx)
- "[Exact quote]" (xx:xx-xx:xx)

ADDITIONAL SNIPPETS BANK:
1. "[Exact quote]" (xx:xx-xx:xx)
2. "[Exact quote]" (xx:xx-xx:xx)
3. "[Exact quote]" (xx:xx-xx:xx)
```

The editor must work only with what was actually said in the video. No paraphrasing, summarizing, or creating new content is permitted. The final clip should feel natural and cohesive despite being composed of different segments from the original video.
