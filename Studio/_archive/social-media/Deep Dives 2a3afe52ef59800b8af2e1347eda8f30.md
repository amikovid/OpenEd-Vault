# Deep Dives

Text: The content format revolves around "Deep Dives" related to Open Education. It includes a cadence of two weekly posts across platforms like a website, LinkedIn, and Facebook. There are guidelines for the project, emphasizing a mix-and-match approach to education, suitable for alternative and traditional schooling. The document outlines the concept of unbundling subjects, allowing for personalized educational experiences. Secondary spokes focus on subjects like Science and English, while tertiary spokes address local microschool opportunities. The launch of a physical catalog is also planned for March or April of the following year.
