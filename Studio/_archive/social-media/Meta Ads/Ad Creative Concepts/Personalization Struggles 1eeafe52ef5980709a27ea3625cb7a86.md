```
My kid's teacher says he's "behind" but at home he's coding his own games?? This system makes no sense 🤦‍♀️

```

**Voiceover Script (Conversational):**
"This is exactly why we left traditional school! With OpenEd, my son focuses on what he's actually good at instead of being labeled as 'behind.' He's building these amazing projects based on his interests, and honestly learning way more math and reading through them than he ever did with worksheets. The best part? They actually count his coding projects toward his educational goals. And we don't pay for any of it—their public school partnerships cover everything. Just sayin'."
