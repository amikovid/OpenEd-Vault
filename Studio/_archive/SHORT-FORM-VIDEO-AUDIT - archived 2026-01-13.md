# Short-Form Video Content Audit

**OpenEd Vault - Studio/Social Media Transformation/Content Formats/**

**Date:** January 12, 2026
**Status:** Comprehensive inventory complete

---

## Executive Summary

The OpenEd vault contains a **robust but disorganized collection of 17+ video formats** spread across the `Content Formats/` folder. These range from highly developed formats (Reel, Horse Mask Ideas, Podcast Clips) to skeletal placeholders (Basic Format, New Template, Reddit, Carousel, GreenScreen Memes).

**Key Finding:** Short-form video production infrastructure exists but lacks a unified project structure, clear asset tracking, and production workflow documentation.

---

## Format Tiers

### Tier 1: Ready to Scale (High Value)

| Format | State | Scripts Ready | Key Strength |
|--------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Reel** | Well-documented | Multiple | Full strategy + Andrew's notes (361KB!) |
| **Horse Mask Ideas** | Excellent | 20+ ready | 12 content patterns, curated scripts |
| **YouTube Remix** | Good process | Need extraction | 13+ source thinkers documented |
| **Text on B-Roll** | Clear concept | Few | Reference examples linked |

### Tier 2: Needs Work (Developing)

| Format | State | Gap |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Podcast Clips | Basic framework | No editing workflow |
| Memes | Light | No template bank |
| Text Heavy | Good templates | Need content bank |
| Screenshot | Clear process | Content sourcing |
| Trend | Good framework | Not populated |
| Deep Dives | Context-heavy | Execution undefined |

### Tier 3: Skeleton (Backlog)

- Carousel
- GreenScreen Memes
- Reddit

## Critical Resource: Andrew's Notes

**Location:** `Content Formats/Reel/Notes from Andrew 203afe52ef5980d2bb36ebef56c524a0.md`
**Size:** 361KB, 6,174 lines

This is a **comprehensive masterclass** covering:
- Algorithm optimization (2-second hook rule, engagement hierarchy)
- Content types (emotional, science-based, how-to, clips, polarizing)
- Publishing strategy (daily posting, viral theory)
- Production methodology (podcasts feed short-form content)
- "Junk food for information" philosophy - consumable over perfect

---

## Existing Skills (Already Built)

**Direct Video Skills:**
- `youtube-clip-extractor` - Download, identify clips, cut with ffmpeg
- `video-caption-creation` - Optimized captions
- `podcast-production` - Complete workflow
- `cold-open-creator` - 25-35 second hooks
- `youtube-downloader` - Transcripts and captions

**Support Skills:**
- `hook-and-headline-writing` - Proven hook formulas
- `dude-with-sign-writer` - Punchy one-liners
- `social-content-creation` - Platform-optimized posts
- `opened-identity` - Brand voice

---

## The Skit Concept (Found It)

**Location:** Inside the Reel file - "Homeschool Showdown: Classical vs. Unschooling"

Full script exists with:
- Clara (Classical) vs Uma (Unschooling) characters
- Setting: Sunny park, picnic blanket, coffee cups
- Escalating debate format that ends in mutual respect
- Kid interruption punchline

This is one instance of a broader format: **Parent Philosophy Debates**

---

## What's Ready to Produce Today

1. **Horse Mask** - 20 curated scripts, exact filming guidelines
2. **Reel: AI Future** - Full script drafted, needs B-roll
3. **Clara vs Uma skit** - Full script, needs actors/location
4. **Text Heavy: 1905 vs 2025** - Script exists, needs design

---

## Notion Access

**MCP check returned empty** - no Notion resources currently available. The YouTube Remix database and other Notion content would need to be exported or accessed differently.

---

## Key Gaps

1. **No unified project** - Formats scattered, no parent structure
2. **No production workflow** - Andrew's theory exists, no execution playbook
3. **No metrics tracking** - No feedback loop from performance to production
4. **Skills not integrated** - Exist but not linked from format docs
5. **Placeholder formats** - 4+ have no substance

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Consolidation
- Create `Studio/Short-Form Video/` project folder
- Move formats into tiered hierarchy
- Write PROJECT.md with charter

### Phase 2: Planning
- Condense Andrew's notes into actionable principles
- Map skills to formats
- Create editorial workflow

### Phase 3: Foundation
- Build content idea bank from scattered scripts
- Set up script inventory CSV
- Create performance tracking

### Phase 4: Launch
- Daily production starting with Tier 1
- 4-week sprint with metrics review
- Iterate based on performance

## Nature Documentary Format (Not Yet Created)

**Concept:** David Attenborough-style narration over homeschool B-roll

> "Here we observe the homeschool mother in her natural habitat... the dining room table, covered in manipulatives and yesterday's lunch..."

**Species profiles:**
- The Charlotte Mason Purist (migratory, found near nature trails)
- The Classical Homeschooler (territorial, guards Latin materials)
- The Curriculum Collector (nesting behavior, hoards unused workbooks)
- The Unschooler (nomadic, follows child's interests)

**Format:** Short-form video (30-60 seconds)
**Production:** Voiceover + stock/original B-roll
**Tie-in:** Could drive traffic to Curriculove quiz

**Status:** Concept documented, needs full format brief
