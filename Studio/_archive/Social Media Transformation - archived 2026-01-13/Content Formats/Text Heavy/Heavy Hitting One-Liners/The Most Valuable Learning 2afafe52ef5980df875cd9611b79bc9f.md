The most valuable learning rarely shows up in a lesson plan.

It shows up in the questions that won't go away.

In the topics that keep pulling your child back.

In the moments when curiosity becomes obsession.

This is what open education protects and nurtures.

Variation: 

WARNING: Your child's most powerful learning moments won't fit neatly into lesson plans.

They'll come from:

- Random questions
- Unexpected connections
- Sudden obsessions

Don't let a rigid schedule kill these moments.
