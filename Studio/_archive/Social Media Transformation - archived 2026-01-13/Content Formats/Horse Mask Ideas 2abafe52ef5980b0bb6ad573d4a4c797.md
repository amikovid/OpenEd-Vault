### Initial Horse Mask Ideas

1. **The Basic Introduction** - Charlie's original 6-second video: spinning in a chair saying "Welcome to the world of horse"
2. **Static/Non-Spinning Variations**:
    - Just standing there holding something (to avoid getting sick from spinning)
    - Jumping into the screen
    - Flipping a board around after writing on it
3. **Outdoor/Movement Ideas**:
    - Running towards the camera (inspired by a skateboarder who runs at the camera, stops, and drives off)
    - Running with cows in the background
    - Doing things next to the neighbor's actual horse
    - Bringing a bucket of food out to the pigs

### Trend Adaptations with Horse Mask

1. **"Late for Work/Traffic" Trend** - Showing up late saying "I got stuck in traffic" then cutting to absurd "traffic" like:
    - Horse shampoo ASMR videos
    - Struggling to get the horse mask on as the "traffic"
2. **"Dude with Sign" Format**:
    - Holding signs with educational messages while wearing the horse mask
    - Specific messages mentioned:
    - Location variations:
        - At a farmer's market with people walking by
        - Hitchhiking on a country road
        - Following cars as they pass to reveal the sign

### Location-Specific Ideas

1. **DMV/Horse Trailer Content**:
    - Going to register a horse trailer at the DMV while wearing the mask
    - Being "the horse" in the horse trailer - sticking head out of the trailer
    - Having someone pull the horse trailer while Charlie's in it as the horse

### Meta/Series Ideas

---

# Guidelines

1. **Taking Normal Memes and Doing Them with the Horse Face** - essentially horsifying existing trending formats
2. **Incorporating Horse Branding**:
    - Wearing an OpenEd horse t-shirt in videos
    - Becoming "the OpenEd horse guy" as a recurring character

The overall strategy was to "play this for all it's worth" and create multiple variations, with Andrew noting it could work across demographics ("kids to teens") and encouraging Charlie to "go bananas with this" since it's "goofy weird" rather than "dark weird."
