## Guest Info / Relevant Context

**Janna:** 

Chavilah,

I was chatting with a colleague and friend, Gretchen Roe, from Demme Learning. She hosts their podcast “The Demme Learning Show”. She would love a copy of Matt’s book and a chat about potentially having him on her podcast. Is that something you might be interested in doing?

**Chavilah:** 

Hi Janna,

We'd love to send her a book! Unfortunately, Matt is taking a break from doing podcasts, but if Gretchen is interested, we'd love to have her on an episode of the OpenEd Podcast.

Let me know, and I can coordinate sending a book and a time for the podcast!

**Janna:** 

Chavilah,

I’m looping Gretchen into the mix! I will let you gals handle it from here. I am so grateful for the opportunity to host Matt. Thank you for making that happen!

**Gretchen:** 

Hi Chavilah! (What a beautiful name.  I would love to know the story.)

I absolutely would love to receive a copy of the book and would be honored to participate in OpenEd's podcast. I appreciate that Matt is taking a break from podcasts.  Perhaps we can talk about him doing an episode in the future, as I typically book guests six months in advance and am looking at my June 2026 calendar now.

My address is 2307 Old Kanuga Road, Hendersonville, NC 28739

I will look forward to collaborating with you.

Cordially,

**Chavilah:** 

Hi Gretchen,

Just sent a copy of "Open Education" to your address! You can book a time on the OpenEd podcast through this link: [https://calendly.com/erichmond-opened/opened-podcast-interview](https://calendly.com/erichmond-opened/opened-podcast-interview)

I'll make a note to revisit your show when Matt continues podcasts.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Chavilah
