Hey there,

Just so you know, we recently did an interview with Peter Gray, and we mentioned you guys.

I know he's not affiliated directly anymore, but thought you might want to accept the collaboration and share this on your account.

Cheers,
Chavilah

HI Chavilah,

Thanks for the heads up! We have accepted the collaboration on Instagram. Peter definitely still supports our work and we support his. If you would like someone from our team to come on your podcast to talk more about what we do and any other questions you have about our work, we would love to do that.

Best,
Bria
