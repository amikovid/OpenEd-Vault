## **Long Form 1: “The Epidemic of Dependent Learners”**

### Title:

1. “The Epidemic of Dependent Learners”
2. “What 12 Years of Rule-Following Does to a Child’s Spirit”
3. “How Schools Accidentally Train Kids to Wait for Instructions”
4. “Why We’re Raising a Generation That Can’t Self-Start”
5. “What It Really Means to Learn for Yourself”

### Description:

In this piercing reflection, **Tyler Thigpen** explains how the industrial model of schooling conditions children to obey rules they didn’t make and answer questions they never asked — eroding their curiosity and self-direction. Drawing from decades in education, Thigpen reveals how this system produces *dependent learners* and what it takes to rekindle true agency and purpose.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Isaac:** You have a phrase I wanted to ask you about — you say you’re trying to combat the *epidemic of dependent learners.* What do you mean by that?

**Tyler:** Yeah, I think, first of all, the way we come at it harkens back to what I was saying earlier. Because the industrialized model and design of schools — which still exists for the vast majority of the country — you’ve got a learner in a classroom for twelve years plus, and they’re having to follow rules they didn’t make.

They’re having to listen to answers to questions they didn’t ask.

And just from a human standpoint — if you do that long enough, what does it do to you? What does it do to your spirit, your heart, your mind, your soul? Is that really in alignment with how we’re meant to experience life?

If you look at our society, I think we’re seeing the results — adults who are dependent in unhealthy ways. Not healthy *interdependence,* but *codependence* — financially, emotionally, intellectually. People waiting around for someone else to tell them what to do.

At the Institute for Self-Directed Learning and at The Forest School, we believe the industrialized model is *graduating generations of dependent learners.* By that we mean: people who don’t know how to seek purpose, who haven’t learned how to learn.

They can’t find a problem, ask questions about it, and pursue answers on their own.

That skill — the will and the skill to learn — is essential if we’re going to restore broken places, build culture, and enjoy meaningful lives.

And you could see it so clearly during COVID. In March 2020, suddenly the world paused — and parents saw whether their kids were self-directed or dependent.

If their child sat around waiting for an adult to tell them what to do, that’s a dependent learner. But if they said, “Alright, I’ve got work to do, it just looks different now,” — that’s a self-directed learner.

I’d really commend Zaretta Hammond’s *Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain.* Her framework influenced me deeply. She makes this distinction between dependent and independent learners — and the truth is, our system trains dependence.

We’ve got to re-train curiosity and ownership.

---

**Isaac:** Oh, absolutely. As a parent, you see that tendency even in small things — the temptation to step in, solve problems, make difficulty go away. It’s faster, it’s cleaner. But if you do that all the time, they learn that *the way to solve a problem is to ask someone else to do it for you.*

And when you stop doing that — when you let them stumble — it’s hard. But that struggle is the birthplace of independence.

**Tyler:** Exactly. And it’s uncomfortable, right? But that discomfort is the training ground for agency.

## **Long Form 2: “Teaching Character in a World That’s Lost Its Compass”**

### Title:

1. “Teaching Character in a World That’s Lost Its Compass”
2. “Why Education Without Morality Doesn’t Work”
3. “The Death of Character — and How to Bring It Back”
4. “What Schools Forgot About Being Good”
5. “Raising Humans, Not Just Students”

### Description:

In this rich and heartfelt exchange, **Tyler Thigpen** and **Isaac Morehouse** unpack one of education’s deepest blind spots — its loss of moral grounding. From Socrates to modern classrooms, Thigpen argues that schools once aimed to shape *character* and *virtue,* but now avoid those conversations altogether. The result? A generation unmoored from meaning.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Isaac:** You mentioned faith earlier. Even if you take religion out of it, human societies can’t function without a moral framework — some shared sense of what’s good and what’s not.

But we’ve created this false belief that education can exist without any moral component. Historically, education *was* about shaping moral character.

Now we treat it like a neutral factory — just facts and skills, no sense of purpose or goodness attached. That feels… strange, right?

**Tyler:** It totally resonates. I love that you’re naming what’s gone before us.

It reminds me of my colleague Dr. Caleb Collier, who wrote *The History and Theoretical Roots of Self-Directed Learning.* He says the same thing — that this isn’t new.

As far back as Socrates, learning was question-based, filled with agency and moral dialogue. Young people were hungry for wisdom, not just knowledge.

We’ve forgotten that.

There’s a book called *The Death of Character,* about a project convened by the University of Virginia. They brought together schools — public and private — to ask: “How do we talk about morals and character in a divided culture?”

Because we’ve reached a point where you can’t even say “this is strong character” without someone asking, “Who’s to say?”

But that relativism has a shelf life.

Eventually, you realize that societies need moral fiber. Not dogma — but shared values that help us care for each other.

And what they discovered in that UVA study is profound: character begins when you see yourself as responsible *not only for yourself, but for others.*

That’s the starting point.

If we don’t teach that — if we only teach self-focus and achievement — we end up with a society that’s smart, skilled, and utterly self-centered.

**Isaac:** Yeah, that’s exactly it. I’m less concerned about test scores than the lack of basic integrity or kindness you see in everyday interactions.

**Tyler:** Right. The goal isn’t just knowledge. It’s wisdom.

## **Long Form 3: “They Designed Their Own School**

### **Title Options**

1. “They Designed Their Own School”
2. “How Kids Became the Architects of Their Learning”
3. “The Most Beautiful School in the World Was Built by Students”
4. “What Happens When You Trust Kids to Design Their Environment”
5. “From Prison Walls to Windows of Light”

### **Description**

In this cinematic story, **Tyler Thigpen** recounts how his students literally designed the building they now learn in — from courtyard layouts to window placements. What began as a simple “architecture quest” became a real-world lesson in imagination, collaboration, and faith. The result: a school filled with light, joy, and meaning — the opposite of the factory-model schools so many kids endure.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Isaac:** I heard your students actually helped design their school building. Is that true?

**Tyler:** It is. It was incredible. About six years ago, we gave our elementary learners a challenge: *If you could design any school, what would it look like?*

They worked in groups during what we called the Architecture Quest. They studied design, construction, interiors, exteriors — then built prototypes from cardboard, popsicle sticks, pipe cleaners — everything.

At a public exhibition, they presented to a panel: our town’s mayor, architects, and construction experts. The judges picked the best ideas, and we took *all* the best ones and handed them to a real architect in Atlanta.

That architect turned those ideas into the building we’re in now.

The next year, our middle schoolers studied biomimicry — nature-inspired design — and added their own ideas. And when you walk through the space, you can feel it.

The kids wanted a courtyard — not one big box, but separate studios surrounding a shared outdoor space. It’s the best thing about the campus: three-year-olds and eighteen-year-olds hanging out together in the courtyard.

They wanted natural light and high ceilings — expensive, but worth it. Because light expands possibilities.

And when we finally moved in, we thanked the heroes — that’s what we call our students — who dreamed it up.

What’s wild is that when we started this quest, we didn’t have land, or money. Just belief. And then our town donated the land.

It’s a reminder that if you trust kids with real challenges, they’ll rise higher than you can imagine.

**Isaac:** That’s beautiful.

**Tyler:** The irony? The temporary building we were in before this was built by the same company that builds prisons.

**Isaac:** No way.

**Tyler:** True story. And we used that to rally even more support — “Help us get out of here.”

So yeah — from prisons to light. That’s what happens when you give kids ownership.
