You don’t want to frame a task as a “the bad thing that I need to get paid to do”

Using rewards as motivation is best done short-term, for getting over temporary humps and initial habit formation.

Rewards are ideal when the activity you’re encouraging becomes either (1) more fun or (2) easier with practice

Eg bribe kids to go to ski lessons and then they get hooked on skiing

Eg use gamified software to learn reading fundamentals and then it gets way easier",01/08/2025,Newsletter,,
