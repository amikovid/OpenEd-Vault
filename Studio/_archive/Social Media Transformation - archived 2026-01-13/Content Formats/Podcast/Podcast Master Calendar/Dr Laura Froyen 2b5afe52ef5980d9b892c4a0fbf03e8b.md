## Guest Info / Relevant Context

**Chavilah:** 

Hi Eugene,

Thanks again for having Matt on the podcast. Unfortunately, he is no longer able to do the interview on Nov. 18th and has to cancel.

If Laura is interested, we would love to still have a conversation with her on the OpenEd podcast.

**Eugene:** 

Oh that's too bad, but thank you for letting me know! Would you like to reschedule? Laura is happy to come on the OpenEd podcast, please feel free to share details!

**Chavilah:** 

Matt is not able to reschedule at the moment, but I'll make a note to revisit in the future!

Laura can schedule a time on the podcast through this link:

Let me know if you can't find a time that works or if you have any questions!

**Eugene:** 

Hi Chavilah,

Thanks so much! I’ll take a look at the link and schedule a time for Laura soon.
