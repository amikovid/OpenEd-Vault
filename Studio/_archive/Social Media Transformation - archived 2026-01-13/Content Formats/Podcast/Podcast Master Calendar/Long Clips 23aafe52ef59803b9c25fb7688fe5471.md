## Transcript (Podcast)

## **Long Form 1 — “The Moment Parents Woke Up”**

### Title:

- “How COVID Sparked the Parent Revolution”
- “When Teachers’ Unions Went Too Far”
- “Why Parents Are the New Special Interest Group”
- “The School Closures That Changed Everything”
- “From Compliance to Courage: How Parents Took Back Education”

### Description:

In this gripping segment, Corey DeAngelis recounts how the pandemic and school closures became the catalyst for the modern parent revolution. What started as frustration turned into a nationwide awakening — exposing hidden agendas, revealing misplaced priorities, and redefining who holds power in education. A story of backlash, courage, and realignment.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Isaac Morehouse:** I love the title of your book. It's not the *Education Revolution* or the *System Revolution*. It’s about *parents.* What’s different about what’s happening now?

**Corey DeAngelis:** Yeah, it is different — and we’re winning so much, Isaac, I’m almost getting tired of winning. Almost.

We’re not done yet, but we’ve made more progress in the last few years than in the past four decades. And it really started because the teachers’ unions stepped on a rake. They fought to keep schools closed during COVID — they *held children’s education hostage* so they could extort more money from taxpayers.

They ended up getting about $190 billion in so-called “COVID relief,” and it had nothing to do with safety. The science was clear — schools should’ve been the first to open and the last to close. Grocery stores were open, bars were open, private schools were open — but government schools stayed shut because they had no incentive to do the right thing and listen to parents.

So families got the short end of the stick in the short run. But in the long term, the unions overplayed their hand. They showed parents that the system doesn’t really care about them — and maybe worse, they *showed them what was really happening inside classrooms.*

Parents saw far-left indoctrination happening over Zoom. They saw critical race theory, gender ideology — all the things they’d been told weren’t happening. Suddenly, they could *see* it.

So they showed up at school board meetings. And what happened? They were labeled *domestic terrorists.* The FBI even created a threat tag for parents protesting.

But here’s the good news: parents have woken up, and they’re never going back to sleep.

The only special interest group that ever had power in education used to represent the *employees* of the system. But now there’s a new one — and it represents *families.* There’s a new sheriff in town. They’re called parents.

## **Long Form 2 — “Education Is Not One Size Fits All”**

### Title:

- “Why One-Size-Fits-All Education Fails Everyone”
- “The Myth of the ‘Public’ School”
- “What Parents Really Want Isn’t Uniformity — It’s Freedom”
- “It’s Not a Culture War — It’s About Who Decides”
- “How Competition Makes Schools Better for Everyone”

### Description:

Corey DeAngelis breaks down why America’s “public school” model is fundamentally broken — and why the real debate isn’t about public vs. private education, but about *who decides* what’s best for each child. A concise, high-energy explanation of freedom, diversity, and why education reform is about parents, not politics.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Isaac Morehouse:** It seems like what we really need is more variety — more room for different ideas and approaches, not one uniform system that almost nobody’s happy with.

**Corey DeAngelis:** Exactly. It’s not one-size-fits-all — it’s *one-size-fits-none.*

We should let a thousand flowers bloom instead. Because by definition, this system is set up to fail. Families are always going to disagree about what kind of education aligns with their values, and that’s okay.

What’s *not* okay is forcing millions of families — especially low-income ones — to send their kids to schools that are fundamentally misaligned with what they believe.

And it’s not even a tyranny of the majority. It’s a tyranny of the *minority.* It’s not parents deciding for other parents — it’s a small group of special interests, the teachers’ unions, and bureaucrats like Randy Weingarten, deciding how to mold the minds of other people’s children.

The only way out of this is freedom — not force. Let families choose the schools that align with their values. That way, nobody’s controlling anyone else’s kids.

That’s how it ought to be. Parents should be in the driver’s seat.

And that’s not a left or right issue — it’s a human issue. Because every family, no matter their politics, deserves the same thing: the freedom to raise their children their own way.

## **Long Form 3 — “You Are the Best Educator Your Child Will Ever Have”**

### Title:

- “You Don’t Need Permission to Educate Your Own Child”
- “Why Parents Are the Real Experts”
- “The Confidence Every Parent Needs to Hear”
- “You Are Your Child’s First and Greatest Teacher”
- “Stop Letting the Elites Tell You You’re Not Qualified”

### Description:

Corey DeAngelis ends the conversation with an empowering message for every parent: *you are enough.* You don’t need credentials or permission to raise and educate your own child. A powerful call to action that blends policy, philosophy, and personal conviction — and leaves parents with renewed courage.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Corey DeAngelis:** The positive note I want to leave parents with is this: **you are more powerful than you believe.**

You’re a better educator than you believe.

Just look at what’s happening in the public school system — there are schools in Chicago where *0%* of students are proficient in math. Zero. You can do better than that.

So try. Just try things out.

Don’t let the elitists tell you that you don’t have what it takes to raise your own kid — because you do.

How did you figure out everything *before* kindergarten? You didn’t need a government credential for that. You are your child’s first and foremost educator — and, I would argue, the best educator your child will ever have.

So take confidence in that — not just in your ability to teach, but in your ability to *change policy,* to stand up, to speak out.

This revolution doesn’t start in the legislature. It starts at your kitchen table.
