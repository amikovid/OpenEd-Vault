# Sunny Simkin

**Sunny:** [00:00:00] there's really just no downside to getting to know who your kids are instead of trying to make them into something else.

**Ela:** all it is, is a choose your own adventure. Now that you know of something that's working for somebody else, it doesn't mean that it's going to work for your kid, but you go.

**Ela:** It's another option.

**Sunny:** Do I want to fill that role of their primary educator? What are what is my obligation or responsibility?

**Sunny:** If that's something that I choose to take on

**Ela:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella Richmond. And today I have on Sunny Simkin. She's a mom of two. She is a single parent. She works inside of the learning division with so many amazing, amazing individuals. And today she's going to share her story about how she is helping her kids to create their own personalized learning experience.

**Ela:** While they're still in public school. So we've talked often about how open [00:01:00] education is broader than just, you know, homeschool, it's broader than just Montessori. It's broader than just public school or private school. It is customizing your child's education. And I think your story perfectly encapsulates what this all means.

**Ela:** So welcome to the podcast.

**Sunny:** Thanks. I'm excited to be here.

**Ela:** Yeah. So we were talking a little bit. Before we started recording and, you were telling me about your experience and how really getting started as a parent and getting started in this open education movement in space. it all started with your learning experience. Can you kind of give a background onto that?

**Sunny:** Yeah. My, my education experience growing up took a few twists and turns. I grew up in a suburb of Kansas city, Kansas, where there were some of the best, in the country. The class sizes were limited to 15. I don't think I ever had more than 10 to 13 kids in any of my classes. And the education structure was so based on critical thinking [00:02:00] and really comprehensive learning, uh, learning the skill of learning. It was a great, great place to grow up. Great place to go to all of my, basically all of my elementary school years. I moved to Utah right before I started junior high and found that it was a completely different learning model where, there were a lot bigger class sizes, so a lot less, personalized, attention and the learning structure was really more of a. Memorize facts to regurgitate for tests and then move on. So it was really difficult for me to adapt to that kind of learning style. But I think the perspective that I have from having both experiences has really informed the way that I, take my kids education and the way that I want them to be able to, yeah, like you said, customize their educational paths to be more tailored [00:03:00] and to kind of identify and fill in the gaps that are left by their public school education.

**Ela:** Yeah, that's incredible. And then you were also explaining that you had a really hard time with math and like, that was the thing that started to eliminate to you that, okay, one size fits all does not work, right? Like, you grew up believing that you just couldn't get this, that this, this was a failure on your part.

**Ela:** And then, you know, over time as an adult, right? So you grew up as a child believing that this is a failure on your part, right? You just can't get it. Something's wrong with you. And then as an adult, you come back to understand. That it's not you. Maybe it's the way you're learning. Maybe it's the way that these concepts are being explained to you.

**Ela:** and that starts to broaden your perspective on your children's lives, right?

**Sunny:** Absolutely. So math was the big one for me that I just couldn't get. And at that point, you know, there just weren't as many options available, [00:04:00] and there also was kind of this belief system that you go to school, and school does the teaching, and if you're not learning, then it's your fault and you need to try harder. And so there wasn't any kind of intervention because it was put back on my shoulders. Well, it's your job to do better and then you'll get it. If you just try harder than you'll get it. Well, because of years of year and years of just really struggling to hang on, I didn't build the necessary math foundations that I needed to carry me through college. And when I went to college, I completed every single course for my major, but failed math so many times that I am actually not even allowed to take math again at my university. I have to take it at a different college and transfer the credits over, which means I would also, at this point, have to start over and take [00:05:00] the lowest level math.

**Sunny:** So we're looking at like, probably four semesters worth of math. to transfer over to my college to get the degree that I've done all of the rest of the work for. It's so frustrating. So, early on, though, it's given me the ability to identify that my daughter, who is in fourth grade, has the exact same struggles with math that I have. And, um, Knowing that there's no amount of try harder that will get her to be able to understand and learn math in just the classroom setting. It's given me such great perspective to reach outward and say, what are, what are options available to me to fill in these gaps in math? She, on her standardized testing has tested significantly below standard in every single math and she is [00:06:00] not stupid.

**Sunny:** She's not, she's such a smart girl. She consistently tests way over average in every other thing. It's not her fault. It is however math is taught in school is not meeting her specific needs. and I remember there was one parent teacher conference that I had where the teacher was like, she's super behind in math, you've gotta work with her harder on it, and I kind of was a little bit like, I, you have her for seven hours of the day, and I only get her for the few after school that she's not in her extracurricular activities, what am I supposed to do?

**Sunny:** Like how, you know, why isn't the need being met here in the classroom? But once you kind of can expand that sort of, okay, this is the way that they're teaching it is not the way that she needs to learn it. She needs to develop skills to overcome the anxiety, first [00:07:00] and foremost, that accompanies math so that she can clear a path toward learning it. So, It kind of got to the point where we needed to take emergency intervention. and I've got her in mathnasium now. Mathnasium's whole model is remove the anxiety, build the confidence and build the foundational skills wherever they're at so that they can actually learn. One of the things that they told me is, I'm so glad you're bringing them in now, bringing her in now in fourth grade, because Once she gets to junior high, once there's algebra, she won't, if she doesn't have the basic foundational math that she needs from these grades, then she's never going to catch up.

**Sunny:** And that was such a validating conversation for me to have because it really, like, gave me this insight, like, Oh, if I, I did do as well as I could, but I those foundational skills that I should have been building in my, in my [00:08:00] elementary school years. So yeah, how am I supposed to catch up when I never? My solid footing in the first place. So she's now enrolled in classes in mathnasium. And then the other aspect that we've added is adding some of our open ed homeroom resources. We've got amazing math programs that gamify math, that make it accessible, that are something that she'd rather do than worksheets. So that's another way that we reinforce, just. Integrating math into our life and our systems and making it more accessible and making it more enjoyable and less scary. So that she can build what she needs to take her through the whole rest of her educational journey.

**Sunny:** Yeah, I

**Ela:** story and just like this specific, It's it's a challenge and a struggle initially, right? You don't start with the with the thought. Okay, this is it. It's too [00:09:00] late. I don't I like this. We're writing her off. She's just not good at math. And maybe we can find other things that she's good at, but recognizing that it honestly could be a learning style.

**Ela:** it could be like you were saying, we have home resources with open ed, which are awesome for a lot of our open ed families, but like, The games, the, the worksheets, the, you know, the different ways of memorizing things, the different ways of learning things. there are so many approaches to education.

**Ela:** There are so many approaches to math. I was just reading something the other day where it was talking about you, how, when kids use their fingers actually for math, it's actually really, really good. and why it was something along the lines of like, It's like the mind body connection kind of a thing.

**Ela:** there's so many different paths. There's so many different options for your child. what has that experience been like though? You know, starting with the, I guess everything that you get inside of public school. So like the traditional schooling model, right? And then saying, okay, now for [00:10:00] every single thing, I'm going to start first with my kid, understanding my kid, um, understanding what their passions are, understanding what they might be interested in, understanding what they might be challenged by.

**Ela:** And then I'm going to help fill the gaps in because I don't expect my school to fill the gaps in better than I can myself.

**Sunny:** first step. Identifying that, Yeah, there might be places that school just can't keep up with. public school is a great option for my kids. It serves them so far in a way that I'm happy with. It provides them the social outlets that they need. It gives them well rounded education. There are aspects of that. their curriculums that are really, really working well for them in ways that I feel really grateful that they have access to, particularly, you know, my experience as a single working mom. I do. It also fills the need [00:11:00] of me being able to work in the daytime. That's one thing that is always something I'm trying to solve for. in my kids education. I want to customize it exactly how I want, but I have to do that within the structure of what I'm actually like, what kind of support I'm actually able to give them during the daytime. Fortunately, I have been able to identify my kids particular learning styles and their social needs and the, you know, the things that bring them, You know, joy and motivation and try to just really feed into all of those curiosities and make sure that they have some sort of outlet for him, not just kind of assumed that school will handle it all. So I've got my, both of my kids in a really, really cool, comprehensive music education program that they take after school in a group setting, that teaches them every aspect of musicianship up to and including. Like how to play piano. So my daughter's [00:12:00] learning piano. My son is just kind of starting on it. my daughter is. Nuts for theater. So she takes theater classes. She's also in, like a company competitive dance team because her social needs and her achievement needs are high. She wants to be a part of everything. She wants to learn everything she can. She's so curious about science and nature and everything.

**Sunny:** So she does Kiwi co creates too. We've got the Kiwi boxes that come. So just any way that she can be. just on the scene with people doing stuff. That's where she wants to be. My son is less inclined to be a part of every single team, but he's been able to find a couple of things that are meaningful for him that are outside of school that give him an outlet for the things that he needs, you know, his outlet for he, we discovered, after, you know, trying soccer and basketball, And t ball and all of the [00:13:00] standard things.

**Sunny:** We found a ninja warrior class that teaches him like parkour and tumbling around and just getting this crazy energy out. That's been a great fit for him, but it is, it's just fun kind of looking out to all of the, you know, I didn't even know that ninja warrior classes existed, but there are so many cool options to just kind of like feed their curiosity and their needs for that. for that expansion of knowledge that comes beyond the classroom.

**Ela:** I love this. You were saying that, I mean, you talked about it in terms of discovery, right? Like you're discovering these things, that are inside of your kids or these, these curiosities, these things that bring them joy. Um, and then you also mentioned like their needs. So like social needs as opposed to, you know, other types of needs.

**Ela:** how do you find these things out and how are you also finding different opportunities for them to try out?

**Sunny:** Hmm. Oh, [00:14:00] that's, that's an interesting question. I just really keep my eyes and ears open. I really pay attention to what my kids like. I talk to a lot of other parents, uh, and see What are you up to? What have you got your kids into? What, what are things that are working for you? That's how I found out about the Ninja Warrior class, for example, and I was kind of lamenting to one of my daughter's dance friends moms. We've both got our kids, our daughters in dance. We're doing all of these performances. And I was lamenting to her. I'm like, gosh, Clue has so many things and we haven't found Keats's thing yet. How do we find his thing? And he, she told me, well, we've got our, I've got my boys in this Ninja Warrior. And I was like, what? So there's a lot of listening. There's a lot of conversations that happen, for sure. I also try. Uh, on my own, like social medias, every now and again, I'll [00:15:00] just post, Hey, this is a place that we have really gotten a lot out of. and I've, I know I've discovered, I discovered Let's Play Music, the music program that my kids are in, from a social media post that somebody else put up.

**Sunny:** Hey, I've got my kids in this and they had their recital today. I just type them right away, what does this program tell me about it? Look into it myself and it tells me. I feel so like I'm just like, Oh, if I would have had this music education as a kid, it's so incredible. I've got so many gaps in my, in my music education, that they're having filled that I'm, that I'm learning along with them.

**Sunny:** And it's so exciting as I, you know, go through them with the program. So, yeah, I think just kind of knowing how to. Put out there what you're doing and invite others to tell you what they're doing is a huge thing, but very much You know the root of it all has to be really paying attention to your kid [00:16:00] Being involved with their teachers checking in with them.

**Sunny:** What are his needs? Where are their struggles? What did she excel at how it can you how can I you know like being really open and You And, like just communicating with their teachers, it's, you know, reveals to me where they want more, where they're struggling. And then I can take that information and go back to all of these many resources and say, how can I, how can I meet that need?

**Sunny:** Yeah.

**Ela:** balance between knowing that something is good for your kid and then also listening to them. And sometimes your kids just don't want to, let's say, they're, they're, they're tired. They don't want to go back to dance class, you know, they're tired.

**Ela:** They don't want to continue doing piano lessons. When, when do you push them to do that versus pulling back and saying, okay, this is something that you don't actually like,

**Sunny:** Yeah,

**Sunny:** no, that's, that's really important. [00:17:00] We discuss everything that we're going to sign up for prior, and we discuss the amount of time. So we're signed up for something, then we complete the season. That's what we are committed to. We're going to take it, if it doesn't, if it's not a great fit for us, we're going to complete our commit, the commitment that we've made.

**Sunny:** We're going to learn from the challenges that we had, and then we're going to reevaluate whether it's something we want to do for the next one. So I am I am pretty, because the thing is, you're absolutely right. Kids may love dance, but they don't want to go after they've been at school for seven hours. And, um, the other thing that we do is just regular check ins. Dance is probably the one, because it's a huge time commitment for Clue.

**Ela:** Mm hmm.

**Sunny:** just like, Oh! Every time she doesn't want to go, we go. And then when I pick her up, I say, Are you glad you went? And it's like, Oh! The answer is always yes, and when it starts becoming no, [00:18:00] then I know it's time to re evaluate whether this is actually a good fit for her life.

**Ela:** I love that. Recently, especially on the podcast, but also just in broader conversations, something that stuck out to me a lot is. In this open education journey and every single family's open education journey, what's really, really, really important is parents paying attention to their kid. And that's the only way that you're going to notice things.

**Ela:** It's the small things that matter. It's, you know, her starting to say, no, I'm actually not enjoying this or yes, this is continuously fun. Even though, you know, she might be tired or even though there might be things that frustrate her about it or, maybe she starts saying no, and then you start digging a little and you start learning that maybe there are classmates that she doesn't enjoy or like, there's always another story.

**Ela:** But being a parent that sees your role as in a way, like a detective, like I'm a detective trying to figure out what my kids passions are, how to help them to become, [00:19:00] you know, the humans that they could potentially be like. That's exciting to me.

**Sunny:** Absolutely. I agree. Completely. And it's It just deepens the relationship that you have with them at the same time because they feel seen and heard and valued and validated. And so, yeah, I mean, there's really just no downside to getting to know who your kids are instead of trying to make them into something else.

**Ela:** Yeah. What's interesting to me is with your kids inside of a public school, how are you present inside of that, you know, that, that educational experience? Are you, you know, keeping tabs on how they're learning or like, how do you make sure that, I guess also there are tests and things that show you that maybe your daughter's not doing the best in math and maybe there's something wrong there.

**Ela:** But how do you make sure that you keep a pulse on something that you don't have complete control over? because I feel like a lot of parents are in that boat where it's like, you don't have complete control over it. But then [00:20:00] it's like, okay, well, I do want to be partially involved and I do want to make sure that I fill in the gaps.

**Sunny:** Yeah. Oh, you know. I don't know that I'm doing as well as I wish, or at least, I don't know that You have to kind of pick what battles you want to face and what, and also kind of identify where challenges can be learning experiences and end up being valuable. And weigh that out in, is this too disruptive, uh, do I want to, do I want

**Ela:** Mm hmm.

**Sunny:** tackle that?

**Sunny:** This is, it's hard to explain my point, but I work all day, I don't have the chance to volunteer in my kids classrooms. If I wasn't working all day, I would absolutely be volun like, that parent that volunteers in the classroom and that goes on all of the field trips and all of those things. It would be awesome to be able to take a, like, a more hands on, involvement.

**Sunny:** That Like I said, I do [00:21:00] check in with the teachers more often than just Parent Teacher Conference. I try to give them their balance. They're spread thin and I get that too, but I do check in. I have my kids involved in, some small group, extra kind of programs within the school too. But there are things that I check in with that I'm like, My daughter, for example, she is a rule follower.

**Sunny:** She wants to be a great student. And when she has kids, particularly in her last year's class, there were kids, there was just, it was kind of an out of control class. It was kind of well known throughout the school that this particular class was extra rowdy and that was really, really difficult for her.

**Sunny:** It really ramped up her anxiety. She wants everyone to listen to the teacher. She wants everyone to be. On their best behavior and it is so distracting to her learning process when There's a chaotic environment that one was a struggle for me I wished that I had more [00:22:00] power to intervene because I knew that that was actually disrupting It wasn't a challenge that she was gonna gain great, you know like benefit from Necessarily, so I think there's always a give and take and a cost benefit analysis when it comes to public school.

**Sunny:** I think it's always wise to be open to, Like, scrutinize, like, what is the cost benefit.

**Ela:** No, I think, I think this is absolutely, completely such a good point that you're making. because what, what it is in this like open education, it's almost like a dance, right? It's like the, the dance between, okay, I would love and I want to personalize my kids education to the maximum degree. I want to uncover all of the things that they could potentially be incredible at.

**Ela:** I want to help them and facilitate them as best as I can. And then the, the The other side, which is okay. As a parent, what are my [00:23:00] constraints

**Ela:** and what do I need help with and what, you know, what other things are other people better experts at? And I think that's something that.

**Ela:** A lot of parents feel we're like, there's a lot of, pressure, especially inside of the open education movement for everybody to be perfect.

**Ela:** And for, you know, every parent to just like, personalize their kids education to the best, you know, possible way and, and for, for everybody to get it right. Um, and I think it's, it's refreshing to remember that there is no right, like, you as a parent, you're going to know your kid best and.

**Ela:** When you have constraints, it's okay.

**Ela:** They will figure it out. And they're very resilient. And, it's about doing your best with what you have. but I think that's why it's so important to highlight and feature stories like yours where it's like, okay. You are a working mom, you're a single parent, you have two kids that are quite, quite involved, you have them in a public school, but you're also trying to [00:24:00] create these new educational experiences for them so that they can experience so much more of the world, so that they can experience so much more of themselves.

**Ela:** it's a hard thing to do, but it's such a valuable commitment for you.

**Sunny:** Right. Yeah, yeah, I think that's exactly right because the scrutiny that you give, you know, that you give your public school, I think it's wise to not be you know, in this mindset that they're going to handle everything. And it's, if, and like we said, to call back to the earlier conversation, if you can't figure it out, then it's, then you need to work harder model to be able to be open to making those adjustments.

**Sunny:** But then in the, in the open ed world, also being not only knowing your kids to your point, but knowing yourself, what do I have the capacity to do? To do and what do I have the capacity to contribute to my kids education? Do I want to fill that role of their primary educator? What are what is my [00:25:00] obligation or responsibility?

**Sunny:** If that's something that I choose to take on and just constantly weighing the costs and benefits to Make sure that you're landing on something. That's the right fit for your whole family

**Ela:** I love that. this has been incredible. Thank you so much for sharing your whole story. The, the note that I wanted to end on was, do you have any resources that you would recommend to other families, other people that have just worked incredibly well for you?

**Sunny:** Of just like programs and stuff that my kids are involved in or

**Sunny:** In general.

**Ela:** uh,

**Sunny:** I absolutely could not recommend more highly the Let's Play Music program. It starts, they have a sound beginnings program that is like toddler age up to age 5, I want to say. And then 3 years of, like, comprehensive music education from 5 to about 8.

**Sunny:** And then there's a continuing program. That keeps like the comprehensive [00:26:00] music education, but with more of a focus on piano playing, it has been unbelievable way for my kids to learn music and, and not hate taking piano lessons. The piano players dilemma is that everyone in adulthood is glad that they know how to play piano and they all hated practicing and going to lessons when they were, when they were a kid.

**Sunny:** They're glad they know now. Let's solve that dilemma by making the education part of it more fun as well. And kids learn really well in group settings in that age group. So I highly recommend the Let's Play Music program. a program that we got a lot of great use out of, uh, in the years that we were still exploring soccer is a program called Soccer Shots. Rather than just the, like, Hunger Games style of melee soccer games that we were getting from our rec center experiences, The Soccer Shots program teaches them actual drills and skills [00:27:00] and makes it all, like, incorporates a lot of play. the soccer instruction. That was an awesome program for us. and then, yeah, there are so many, especially in my area that I live in, so many incredible arts programs.

**Sunny:** This is my area here in Utah is Richly populated with so many arts, dance, music, theater, so many cool programs like that. I will shout out Mathnasium, uh, CLU for the very first time ever. Got one step higher. So she's not significantly below standards. She's just below standards now in math. And we are taking that as a win. So mathnasium, it's expensive. I wish it was a little more accessible. I feel like those kinds of educational foundations shouldn't just be for, you know, shouldn't cause financial burden, but it really has filled the need that we, that we were [00:28:00] desperate for in the time that we needed it. So. Yeah,

**Sunny:** I mean, I could go on. You want to wrap up with that question. I'll talk for another hour.

**Ela:** No, I think that's so important, for parents specifically to share all of the things that are working for them and their kids, because it, all it is, is a choose your own adventure. It's okay. Now that you know of something new that now that you know of something that's working for somebody else, it doesn't mean that it's going to work for your kid, but there you go.

**Ela:** It's another option.

**Sunny:** Exactly. And so many times you don't know them until you,

**Sunny:** until someone tells you, so you don't even know what to ask. So

**Ela:** exactly. Well thank you so, so, so much for coming on the podcast. This has been incredible.

**Sunny:** Thanks Elle, I appreciate it.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Long Clip Verbatim Transcript (00:13:00–00:16:00)**

> Ela: You were saying that, I mean, you talked about it in terms of discovery, right? Like you're discovering these things that are inside of your kids—these curiosities, these things that bring them joy.
> 
> 
> How do you find these things out and how are you also finding different opportunities for them to try out?
> 
> **Sunny:** That’s an interesting question. I just really keep my eyes and ears open. I really pay attention to what my kids like. I talk to a lot of other parents and see—what are you up to? What have you got your kids into? What are things that are working for you?
> 
> **Sunny:** That’s how I found out about the Ninja Warrior class, for example. I was lamenting to one of my daughter’s dance friends’ moms, “Clue has so many things and we haven’t found Keats’s thing yet. How do we find his thing?” And she told me, “We’ve got our boys in this Ninja Warrior class.” I was like—what?!
> 
> **Sunny:** So there’s a lot of listening. There’s a lot of conversation. I also share things myself—like, I’ll post, “Hey, this is a place we’ve gotten a lot out of.” That’s actually how I found the *Let’s Play Music* program. Someone posted their kids’ recital, and I DM’d her immediately: “What is this program? Tell me everything.”
> 
> **Sunny:** And when I looked into it, I thought—*if I had this as a kid, my entire music education would have been different.* I have so many gaps that my kids are now filling, and I’m learning along with them.
> 
> **Sunny:** So yeah, it’s about being open. Sharing what works, asking others what’s working for them, and being really present with your kids. Check in with their teachers. Notice where they’re struggling or thriving. And then take that info and go find the resources that meet those needs.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela:** What it is in this open education journey—it's almost like a dance, right? Between wanting to personalize your kids’ education completely and knowing your own constraints as a parent.

**Sunny:** Right. Yeah, yeah. I think that's exactly right because the scrutiny that you give your public school—I think it’s wise to not be in this mindset that they're going to handle everything.

**Sunny:** And like we said earlier, if you can't figure it out, then you need to work harder—that’s not the model anymore. Being open to adjustment is everything. But then in the open-ed world, it’s also about knowing yourself. *What do I have the capacity to do?*

**Sunny:** What do I have the capacity to contribute to my kids’ education? Do I want to fill that role of their primary educator? What are my obligations or responsibilities if I choose to take that on?

**Sunny:** It’s about constantly weighing the costs and benefits—to make sure that you’re landing on something that’s the right fit for your whole family.
