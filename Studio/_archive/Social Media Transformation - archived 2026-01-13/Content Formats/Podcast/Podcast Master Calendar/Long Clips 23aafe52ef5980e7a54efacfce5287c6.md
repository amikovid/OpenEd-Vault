### Description:

In this raw and heartfelt story, *Laura Feller* opens up about the fear and doubt she faced when she first pulled her son out of public school. What began as a desperate decision turned into a powerful realization about capability, community, and love. This clip captures the emotional core of every parent’s homeschooling journey — the moment they stop asking “Can I?” and start saying “We can.”

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** What is that like being a problem solver as a mother, like seeing all these things and then saying, okay, it's very tough in the moment, especially when you're in the thick of it, to decide, I'm not going to take the easy way out, I'm actually going to try and make sure we are fixing this — that we are actually solving the problem?

**Ela Richmond:** And then to uncover more issues along the way is also quite difficult. How do you walk with your kid in that, and how do you, as a parent, maintain the resolve to continue trying to figure it out — to make learning something fun for this kid?

**Laura Feller:** It has been such a challenge. In the beginning it was overwhelming and scary — *Can I help him? Do I have the ability? Do I have the resources? Am I enough to help him?*

**Ela Richmond:** Mm.

**Laura Feller:** And the answer was yes. Yes, I am enough to help him. My husband is enough. As a family, we are enough — because we don’t have to do it on our own.

We have a community. We have resources in the community that can help us manage and find the pathway that's best for him. And that's been the case for all of our children.

My youngest wasn’t talking at all until he was three — and now he’s going to be in a production of *Matilda* on stage.

The things our boys have been able to accomplish, with the freedom to explore and find those passions as outlets, have helped us push forward through the hard times — through the moments when we felt overwhelmed and wanted to give up.

There is no “give up.” Life continues. Kids grow. And they need us to keep learning and growing with them.

## **Long Form 2 — “Don’t Recreate School at Home”**

### Title:

- “Why You Shouldn’t Recreate School at Home”
- “The Truth About De-Schooling (and Why It Saved Our Family)”
- “How We Found Freedom by Doing Less”
- “Learning Doesn’t Start at a Desk”

### Description:

Laura recalls her first homeschooling conference and the advice that changed everything: *Don’t try to recreate public school at home.* What follows is a transformative story about de-schooling — rediscovering curiosity, rebuilding family connection, and finding joy in learning again.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** I would love if you could give me an overview of your homeschool journey. How did you start — did you try to recreate public school at home?

**Laura Feller:** I went to a homeschool conference that summer, and I’ll never forget — I attended a seminar called *Homeschooling 101* with Terri Ann Perkey. She saved our homeschool journey.

She said, *“Do not recreate public school at home. That is not the way.”*

And because I loved public school — it worked for me — I was 100 percent ready to do that at home. I was going to have a chalkboard, a schedule, the whole nine yards.

But she introduced me to the concept of **de-schooling** — pulling out of school completely, observing your children, finding out how they learn, what sparks them, what time of day they’re most alert.

We rebuilt family connection. We explored museums, parks, playdates, field trips.

And slowly, we began adding learning back in — audiobooks in the car, hopscotch math on the driveway, reading under blankets. Learning became second nature in everything we did.

During COVID, we even started an outdoor science club — experiments in our front yard, neighbors joining in. It was messy, beautiful, real education.

And that’s when I realized: homeschooling isn’t about controlling learning — it’s about releasing it.

## **Long Form 3 — “Learning How to Learn”**

### Title:

- “The Real Goal of Education: Learning How to Learn”
- “Why We Wrote a Family Mission Statement”
- “Our Homeschool North Star”
- “How to Stay Grounded Amid Endless Choices”
- “Raising Kids Who Love to Learn for Life”

### Description:

After eight years of open education, Laura reflects on how her family stays grounded through endless opportunities — by keeping a clear mission: to raise kids who know *how* to learn. This reflective segment captures the wisdom of experience and the peace that comes from alignment and purpose.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** What would you say are your goals with open education — both when you started and now?

**Laura Feller:** That’s really interesting. Something Terri Ann said early on was: *Write a mission statement.* Because there are so many opportunities and advantages to homeschooling that you can get lost — distracted by every shiny thing.

She said, *Write it down. Memorize it. Stay focused on it.*

For us, the goal was simple: that our boys would learn **how to learn** — in the way that works best for them.

My husband loves history. He teaches it because he’s passionate about it. He explains it in ways that make our boys love it too.

And that’s the lesson — learning doesn’t stop at graduation. If there’s something you love, you can explore it. We provide the tools, not the limits.

I don’t know how to play the banjo or harmonica, but my son does — because he found the resources and taught himself.

That’s what we wanted. That’s what open education gave us — kids who *want* to learn, who *know how* to learn, and who enjoy the process.
