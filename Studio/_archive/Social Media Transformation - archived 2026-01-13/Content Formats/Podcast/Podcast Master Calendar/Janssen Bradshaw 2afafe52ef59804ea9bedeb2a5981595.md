## Guest Info / Relevant Context

Notes from Ela: 

0:00: So here's a quick background.
0:01: We talked about a lot of different things.
0:03: so she's a homeschool family.
0:04: She actually is an open ed family, but I didn't ask her about that in the episode.
0:08: I, I wasn't sure.
0:10: I assumed it, but I didn't ask her ahead of time.
0:12: Anyways, so she is a homeschool family that's done tons of different education approaches.
0:17: She grew up with tons of books in her home, and she actually started this Instagram account every day reading.
0:23: , 20 years ago, which is crazy, and then I think 10 years ago or something like that, it started to blow up, and now she's at like almost 600K followers.
0:31: But she talks a lot about how your environment shapes you and your family, and how you can kind of create a culture of reading in your home, especially as a homeschooler.
0:40: And then we kind of went into her story with Savvy.
0:43: So she ended up having one daughter that was just like a phenomenal reader, and then her second daughter was really struggling with reading, like very behind.
0:52: And she was really surprised about it all because she'd put books in front of her kids for a young age.
0:57: her first daughter was like way advanced, and now her second daughter was way behind.
1:02: And then they started actually having a tutor do one on one stuff with her.
1:06: And then they saw how much it helped their daughter improve.
1:10: And So they actually started doing that on a larger scale.
1:13: That's basically what savvy is, it is available in the open ed marketplace.
1:18: and we just talked a lot about like, how reading has made our kids more curious, kind of the the benefits of reading, how she approaches her homeschool, as a founder and mom.
1:30: And we talk about like different reading habits, we talk about her favorite series, we talk about recommendations for reading as a busy mom.
1:39: It's a really good episode on reading.
1:42: , and I think it's pretty relatable, but just because it comes from a homeschool mom herself, and she's also just kind of like, really interesting.
1:50: And I think like, her family is idealistic for a lot of people, like the way that they love reading, the way that they read, the way that they've integrated it into their family, and it seems like it's such a backbone of who they are.
2:02: So, hope that gives you enough.
2:04: Just let me know.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Bass (00:00.7)
Welcome back to the open ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella and today we are joined by someone who has quite literally helped hundreds of thousands of families fall back in love with reading Janssen Bradshaw You probably know her from everyday reading the beloved blog. She started a while ago, which we're gonna get into that's become a go-to place for book recommendations reading guides Practical inspiration all kinds of things. She's also a mom and the co-founder of savvy learning which is

an amazing resource that is live in the open ed marketplace. So we'll get to talking a little bit about that. I'm so excited for you to hear from her today, but I wanted to begin with a question. So Janssen, I'm really curious. In today's world, there are screens, there are all these things competing for children's attention, and it seems like in your family, you've helped your kids fall in love with reading. How did you do that?

Janssen Bradshaw (00:54.382)
Well, I love this question. It's such a fun place to start. I feel like I grew up with such a strong love of reading. We had such an environment of reading in my family and that was really important to me when I had my own kids. And so I think this is the answer nobody likes to hear. But if you have a lot of screens competing, it's hard for books and reading to compete with just the

Ela Bass (01:23.328)
Mm.

Janssen Bradshaw (01:23.38)
dope rush of a screen. And I mean, I say that not just about kids, but for me personally, know, as phones and, you know, television and all those become more and more part of our lives, I have to work harder and harder to make time for reading in my life. So from the time my first child was born, I thought, you know, I really want to be very thoughtful about how we use screens in our family. And I wanted to be books and reading first.

and have that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens. And that's kind of way that we've continued to go as our kids get older. My oldest is now 15 and my youngest is almost nine. And I love screens. I think they have a fantastic place in our world. My whole living is made online, basically on my phone. And so I...

see lots of value in that personally and professionally, educationally, and I just feel like I want to make sure that I have a strong balance and foundation of, you know, page slash book first before it's competing with all of those.

Ela Bass (02:37.62)
For sure. What was your environment like as a kid and then now with your family, what is your environment like? Do you have a TV in the center of the living room or do you just have books everywhere? What does it look like to actually shape your environment?

Janssen Bradshaw (02:54.872)
So we do have actually a stupidly large television in our basement hangout room, but we don't have one in our family room. And I grew up with the TV not ever on just as background noise. And I actually just personally don't like, I know some people love having that sound on. So it doesn't feel as lonely at home. And I totally get that. For me, it's very overstimulating for me. So.

You know, we turn the TV on when we're actually going to watch something and almost always when we're going to watch as a family, not a lot of solo watching in our family. We do have a ton of books in our house. You know, our kids have books in their rooms. We have a big library bookshelf, you know, for library books in our living room. We have built-in bookshelves in our living room. We have a huge, you know, floor to ceiling bookshelf in our playroom with all the picture books. And, you know, we go to the library a lot.

We are a huge audio book family. we have a lot of, you know, we have yodo players, have Echo Dot so they can listen to audible books. So books and reading are just a very natural part of our lives. I read aloud to my kids pretty much every night. Part of our homeschool day is kind of the last part of our homeschool day is that we do family reading just before lunch. And so everybody brings their books into the living room and we all read for 30 minutes our own books, which is my favorite part of the day.

Ela Bass (03:52.736)
Mmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (04:19.598)
because I'm always getting good reading time in then, which has been harder and harder for me to do as my job has gotten busier, to have that dedicated reading time. So I love that. And then for my growing up, so I was homeschooled growing up from kindergarten. I didn't go to public school until I was in high school. And even then I went part time through high school.

My mom was an English major. She's a huge reader. My dad's a big reader. And so she read tons out loud. She always read out loud to us. But also she read individually with all of us as part of our homeschool day. Even when I was in high school, you know, we should get two copies of whatever book and she'd read a page. I'd read a page. She'd read a page. I'd read a page. You know, we did that Pride and Prejudice and Picture of Dorian Gray and Tale of Two Cities and Huckleberry Finn, you know, like all these classics that, you know,

For a lot of time, if you hand over to a 14 year old, they're kind of like, have no idea what's going on here and I hate this. But if you have an adult there, you know, to make sure you're going at a reasonable pace, you're not skimming over things and to say, okay, did you notice this? Or like, pay attention to this character, he's gonna be important. Or, you know, like, did you notice what she said here? This is gonna get echoed a lot of times. That's super helpful. And I try to do that for my kids. Books that maybe would be overwhelming for them to just be handed on their own, but with a little hand holding.

Ela Bass (05:15.028)
Mm-hmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (05:39.298)
they can really have a positive experience with.

Ela Bass (05:42.238)
That's amazing. Did I hear you say that you have a library bookshelf?

Janssen Bradshaw (05:45.62)
Yes, we do. just, my husband does not like to lose library. I mean, I don't like to lose library books, but he really doesn't like to lose library books. So to have one place where they kind of all live that, you know, when they come home from the library, then you know where they're going to go. And when you need to take them back, you know where they're all going to be.

Ela Bass (05:52.178)
Eheh

Ela Bass (06:02.324)
That is so smart. That's an amazing hack. I would never have thought of that. Out of curiosity, how many books do you all think you have in your home?

Janssen Bradshaw (06:10.518)
it's a lot. mean, I would say easily two to 5,000. You also have to remember that I'm a book blogger. I'm a book Instagrammer. I get a lot of books from publishers. I've been doing this for a long, long time. was an elementary school librarian before I had kids. I went to all these conferences where I'm on all the mailing lists. So my book experience is not...

Ela Bass (06:17.428)
Holy moly, my gosh.

Ela Bass (06:23.082)
Fair.

Ela Bass (06:36.34)
Mm-hmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (06:39.266)
typical because it's also so much of my job.

Ela Bass (06:42.954)
That's fair. That's so fair. I was reading a post by Claire Honeycutt, who's a PhD and she's really cool, but she was saying that she's actually creating a library in her home, basically. And I think that's such a cool idea to surround your kids with just tons of ideas, right? And like that be the world that they go into. It's pretty close to my heart, because like growing up, my parents had a couple of massive bookshelves and like they were floor to ceiling. And so as a child, like even

really young. I remember going to the bookshelf and being able to grab the books on the lowest, the lowest area. And like, I would literally just sit there for hours before I could read and just flip through them. Or like, when I could read, I'd grab a whole stack, I'd take them to my room. And like, them being accessible was how I filled some of my time. Like when I'd get really bored, it was just like, all right, like, let me go do something. What age did you start introducing, like, books and literature to your kids? And

I think something that's difficult for lot of parents, especially homeschool parents, is as you have more children and you're trying to teach them and read with them, the distraction of other kids gets in the way, right? How do you deal with that? Because you mentioned that you like sitting down and reading with your kids individually. Is it like a group type of thing or is it just kind of like a part of y'all's homeschool that you do it that way now?

Janssen Bradshaw (08:04.782)
Well, when I read aloud to my kids at night, that's everybody together. And I usually choose a book that kind of targets my two middle kids. So it might be a little bit of a step down for my 15 year old. Sometimes it might be a little bit of a stretch for my youngest. But you know, that's kind of the sweet spot that I'm targeting. And I've completely lost the train of what you asked. Oh, when you're.

So when you're working with a bunch of kids, know, they're, think, just kind of embracing a little bit of the chaos, like recognizing it's not going to be, you know, Norman Rockwell type of painting by the fireplace, you know, everyone's all quiet. One of my best tricks is that my kids are almost always doing something while I read to them. Legos or coloring or, you know, making something with Play-Doh.

Ela Bass (08:38.944)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (08:49.152)
Mmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (08:55.886)
you know, to keep your hands busy. And I mean, I'm the same way as an adult. If I don't want to just sit on the couch and listen to an audio book, I'm doing dishes or folding laundry or working on a jigsaw puzzle or going for a walk or, you know, whatever those things are that keep my hands busy that then let my brain engage with that book rather than feeling really fidgety, you know, that it's really hard, especially for kids, but frankly, for lots of adults too, is like to just sit there and listen is pretty tricky.

Ela Bass (09:02.868)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (09:16.51)
Mmm.

Ela Bass (09:24.608)
So do you pair it with something that you know that they already like? So like Legos, if your kids are already interested in Legos, it's like, okay, well, I'm gonna let you do Legos. This is your opportunity and it's really fun. And I'm gonna read to you at the same time.

Janssen Bradshaw (09:37.294)
Yeah, so often, you know, like last night when I was reading to my kids, said, okay, you know, does anybody want to color? Go grab your coloring stuff. Okay, you guys are going to do the Legos. Why don't you get out the Legos and then we'll clean those up at the end when we're done reading. You know, so I usually give them a few minutes to kind of figure out what are you going to do while I read to you?

Ela Bass (09:56.372)
That's really cool. And then, like through the culture of your family, have you seen reading impact that?

Janssen Bradshaw (10:03.566)
absolutely. one of my favorite things is seeing how much my kids have shared identity around specific books and series. For instance, if you're familiar with the Penderwicks, which is a five book series, really sweet, really cute. I'm pretty sure my kids have listened to those. 15 or 20 times the whole series through maybe more than that. And of course that I have four girls. This is a series with four sisters. And so.

Ela Bass (10:19.295)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (10:26.761)
Wow.

Janssen Bradshaw (10:33.068)
you know, sometimes they'll call each other by the names in there, or, you know, they have these shorthand that they use referencing characters in the books or phrases that the characters say. Another series that my kids love is Nanny Piggins, which is kind of just this, it's Australian, outrageously weird series. You know, if you have kids that like Wayside School or Mrs. Piggle Wiggle, or those kind of just like a little bit far-fetched.

wacky books. This series is so funny. My husband and I have listened to a lot of it with them too. And the kids in our neighborhood, when they come over and play taboo, you know, and you're trying to get people to guess clues, they're like, you cannot use any nanny Piggins references because you guys can literally make any connection. the thing that happened in book seven where, you know, whatever they're like, you can't do it. And so I love seeing that for my kids is that these are really strong connections. And I saw just kind of a similar thing when

I was growing up, there were a couple of comic strips that my family was very into and we had the book versions of them. And so about four or five years ago, my siblings and I all went to visit my parents. There were no spouses, no grandkids. was just the original six of us. And over breakfast, my mom brought all these comic books that she still had down to the breakfast table and we were all sitting around reading, do you remember this one? And it was such a fun.

shared experience from our childhood that had carried into adulthood. And so I love seeing that for my kids. And, you know, I love rereading and I think kids really love rereading. so especially audio books is such a good way for them to revisit those favorite stories that really become part of who they are. And then especially if they're shared with siblings, part of their sibling relationship and culture.

Ela Bass (12:23.198)
That is so, so cool. And then I want to touch into your homeschool journey. So you were homeschooled yourself. Why did you decide to homeschool your children? know that sometimes people will go through homeschool themselves and then decide to do it opposite. Sometimes whenever you've gone through it yourself, you decide to do it differently. What does your homeschool look like and why did you decide to do it?

Janssen Bradshaw (12:47.384)
So we've kind of done all variations over the last 10 years since my oldest went into kindergarten. So at the beginning, she went part-time to kindergarten. So she would go, we'd homeschool in the morning, and then she'd go in the afternoon to kindergarten at our neighborhood school, which is a full-day kindergarten. So all the kids were there all day, and she would only come for the after lunch part. And then at about Christmas, she was just like, I don't want to go anymore.

So was like, well, we're already homeschooling. Like it's not going to make a big difference if she just then doesn't go to school in the afternoon. So we finished out the year homeschooling entirely. We did first grade homeschooling entirely. And then in second grade, I just had my fourth baby. My business was kind of picking up. I was feeling pretty underwater and we had a really good STEM school in our district and it was an open enrollment district. So you could go to any school in the district.

And so we went and checked it out. seemed like it was going to be a really good fit. And so she went there in second grade and third grade. really, or second grade, really great experience. We probably would have stayed there long-term, but we ended up moving out of state. And when we moved, then all my kids went to public school until my oldest. So she did third, fourth, third, fourth, and fifth in this. This is such a long more than you want here. it. So that.

Ela Bass (14:08.84)
No, this is amazing. It's real. It's so real.

Janssen Bradshaw (14:11.342)
Yeah, so she, you everybody was in school full time and then in sixth grade, my oldest daughter, she was quite a bit ahead in math. And so her teacher suggested, Hey, you know, there's this really good online math class that she might, might challenge her a little more. She can do that while we, you know, on the laptop, kind of at the back of the classroom while we do our on grade level math.

And so she was, you that was great. We were doing that for a couple of weeks. And after a little while of that, my daughter was like, can I just do this math at home? And, you know, because like my timing's not syncing up very well, you know, they'll be in the middle of this, you know, they're done and I'm not quite ready to be done or I'm done and I don't want to start a new lesson and then five minutes in, et cetera. So we got permission from the school district for her to just go half the, you know, the part of the day.

Ela Bass (14:56.564)
Mm-hmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (15:05.394)
and she would do her math and a few other things at home. that was kind of, you know, I had felt like, okay, we're going to be a full public school family. And then this sort of opened the door to like, maybe we have some other options. And so she ended up going part-time in sixth, seventh and eighth. And now she's in 10th grade, she still goes part-time. But then two years ago, we actually just happened to live in a neighborhood with a lot of homeschool families. And

So two years ago over lunch during the summer, my kids were like, could we homeschool next year? None of the rest my oldest had homeschooled and, you know, except for like preschool and, my husband and I were like, you know, I think I kind of felt like now I didn't have these tiny babies. you know, things were a little bit more under control with my business. I was like, I feel like for the first time in a long time, I have the bandwidth to consider this.

Ela Bass (15:41.342)
Wow!

Janssen Bradshaw (16:03.296)
And so now we're two years in, I mean, we're in the second year and it's been really a great fit. And one of the things that I love about homeschool, and I think my mom was very good about this, is that, you know, what you choose now doesn't have to be what you choose forever. You know, right now homeschool might just seem like something you want to do, but you have no capacity for. And you can make a different decision a year down the road, two years down the road, five years down the road. Or if you choose to homeschool,

That doesn't mean you have to homeschool forever. There might be a better, different situation and what's right for one child might not be right for your other children. For instance, I did not graduate from high school. I just went part-time so I didn't get a diploma. I took the ACT, I went to college, I went to grad school. It was not a problem that I didn't graduate from high school, but all my siblings went full-time to high school. They all graduated from high school. And we just had...

It was just a different, better fit for each of us. And I think my mom was very open to that. You I felt like my mom did not have an agenda. Like this is the way things are going to be and you better do it the way I want it to do. was always, I felt like what's the best fit for you right now. And I'm open to that changing as you change and grow and develop. you know, what are the opportunities available to us at this moment?

And so I try really hard to have that for our kids too, is that, you know, what's the right fit for you? so we've just done a lot of different things. We've had, you know, kids go to our neighborhood school. We've done immersion, you know, language immersion schools. We've done STEM schools. We've done homeschool. We've done full-time homeschool. We've done part-time homeschool. And, you know, so I really try to stay open to like, what's the best fit right now and not feeling like whatever decision I make has to be the decision now for all of my kids through all of their...

you know, K through 12 experience.

Ela Bass (17:57.438)
Yeah, that's really interesting. A lot of people, like there's almost a stigma around like changing your mind or trying different things or saying, hey, we're going to do this for one year and then we do this for another year. It's like, OK, we'll pick. What have your kids gotten from all of these different experiences? The language immersion, the public school, the part time, the full time home school. Like what has this kind of like conglomeration of different types of education done for them nowadays?

Janssen Bradshaw (18:04.077)
Yeah.

Janssen Bradshaw (18:26.71)
feel like the biggest thing that it has given them is ownership of their education. You know, I think I'm 40. In my day, when I was being homeschooled, it was very fringe. There were very few homeschoolers and everybody I knew went to the local public school, you know, that you went in kindergarten and you graduated at 12th grade. Like there is not a lot of variation. And now I feel like there's so many options and

that my kids can look around and say like, what do I want out of my school experience? What's valuable to me? And you know, and I think the thing that I want them to know is like, it's gonna be a lot of work and effort and you know, effort, whatever you choose to do, but we can find an option that's really good for you and that pushes you where you are. And so,

Ela Bass (19:12.33)
Mm-hmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (19:23.158)
I love that. want them to feel like they have a say in their education. And you know, my husband and I talk about this all the time. You see like so many people get to college and kind of struggle because it's been very lockstep for them the whole way.

Ela Bass (19:40.81)
Mm-hmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (19:41.646)
Now they suddenly have to make decisions like OK, I have to pick a major. They're not just telling me here's the classes you need to do to graduate. I have to decide what am I going to study? What do I care about? What do I want to do after school? So I love for my kids to be having practice on a lower level making those decisions. Now like what do I want to learn about this year in 5th or 6th grade? How hard am I going to go on this language? What AP tests do I want to take? What careers would I like to explore a little bit right now as I'm a sophomore in high school so that it's not such a?

jarring experience when they get to college and suddenly, you you have more of the reins on that decision making.

Ela Bass (20:18.976)
That's amazing. Can you walk me through that a little bit more? Because I think it's very interesting that your children have this understanding of what do I want and also that they have ownership of their education, that they feel like they have a say, as you said. How did they become like that? What kind of questions did you ask early on? How did you approach their education? Or is it just kind of like the way that you approach life in your family that

over time they grew into these unique individuals that actually were aware of who they were. Do you think that reading played a part in that? Yeah. What do you think about all that?

Janssen Bradshaw (21:01.87)
Well, I think a lot of it is just kind of our general family culture. My husband and I both have non-traditional jobs, you know, and we've done a lot of different things. We've moved a lot of places. I mean, I think we were just counting up the other day. I think this is the 15th house that my husband and I have lived in, and we've been married about 20 years. You know, so especially my husband is not afraid of change. I'm learning to be more okay with change. And of course, my job on social media.

Ela Bass (21:16.117)
my gosh!

Janssen Bradshaw (21:29.974)
It's such a quick changing landscape has given me a lot of practice on that. So I think they see that a lot. And, you know, as we move, okay, how are going to make new friends? Let's go explore a new library or learn, you know, learn what's cool about this place. And, you know, how are we going to make this feel like home for us? And so I think that that is just part of our family culture. And I think also, you know, so it's not like when we talk about homeschool that I'm like,

The world is your oyster. You can pick anything you want to do this year. I'm like, okay, we're going to be doing science. What kind of things would you like to learn about in science? But it's not like, let's just not do science, you know, or whatever. Or like, we're going to do history and these are the things we're going to do in history. This is what we did last year. What would you like to change this year? You know, you know, so I feel like I have framework, but they have a lot of say within that framework, if that makes sense, but it's not like, hey, you're six.

Ela Bass (22:13.994)
Mmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (22:24.438)
tell me what you want your ideal curriculum to look like. That's too overwhelming for a kid, you know, but they can have say in like, this is a thing I'm really interested in. It was actually just this week or yesterday, you know, two of my girls were really interested in American Sign Language and they, you one of our neighbors had mentioned that they have a niece who's deaf and so they were learning some sign language. So they came home and they watched some YouTube videos and then they got on the live

website and they requested some books and they're like, after dinner, can you take us to the library to pick up these books? Cause we want to like practice some more. And that's like exactly what I want for my kids is to feel like they have the resources and the understanding of if there's something they're interested in, how do I learn more about this? How do I change down this interest? And I think, you know, because they were like, let's look at the library books and see what the library has, you know, just that understanding that books are such a great way to get the kind of knowledge.

Ela Bass (23:08.234)
That's cool.

Janssen Bradshaw (23:21.384)
that can answer the questions that you have is kind of part of their fundamental understanding of the world.

Ela Bass (23:27.75)
I love that. And it also sounds like you'll read together. you, it's not like you're reading alone in your bedroom, although you could, but but, but like a large part of your family culture is that you read openly. And so your kids have grown up watching and, know, being the benefactors of the fact that like you love it too. And I think that's obviously so important.

Janssen Bradshaw (23:31.777)
Yeah.

Janssen Bradshaw (23:49.826)
Yeah.

Ela Bass (23:54.752)
Something else that I'm really curious about, is the day, like what does a day in the life look like for your family now? Because you mentioned that you all have tried basically everything and then now you have structure. But it's so fascinating because literally everybody's approach to homeschooling is so different. It's like, you know, a mix of online, it could be a mix of like in-person community classes. It could be, I talked to somebody recently, Bretney Shannon, who actually does this thing called the unit studies. So instead of like subjects, she'll just focus on a specific

Janssen Bradshaw (24:09.23)
100%.

Ela Bass (24:24.65)
topic and like touch a lot of subjects inside of it. What is y'all's approach?

Janssen Bradshaw (24:30.36)
So, you know, because my kids are older, you know, this would look different if I was homeschooling, you know, a five, three, five, seven, nine year olds, but because my kids are all a little older, they have a lot of autonomy. So, you know, they, kind of have these charts of like all the things that they do every day. And the morning, you know, early in the morning, they kind of have their scheduled classes. So they do Mandarin tutoring because we were in a Mandarin immersion school. When we started homeschooling, I wanted my kids to keep up, you know, their immersion.

language studies, so they have a tutor that they work with in the morning. So, you know, they meet with her over Zoom. And then, you know, my daughter has her savvy reading and math classes. So kind of have these scheduled things early. And then they kind of have a block of time where they can just figure out what they want to do, you know, what order they want to do, what am I going to do my poetry stuff? What am I going to do my typing practice? And, know, so, you know, it's kind of an open ended

this is the time to do this, but you can do it in any order you want and you're kind of the driver on this. And then we finish with, they either do geography every other day, they either do geography with my husband or history with me. And then we finish with family reading. So it's kind of these like scheduled online things in the morning, free homeschool stuff that they do. And then family wants to end the day is kind of what that looks like.

Ela Bass (25:55.04)
That's awesome. Yeah, I love that. And was that something that you figured out over time works for your family and like, I don't know, the rhythm that you'll naturally have or was any of that something that your mom did that you took into your own homeschool journey as well?

Janssen Bradshaw (26:12.064)
Yeah, I mean, we did kind of similar things when I was growing up, you know, where we had like, here are the things you need to get done today, but you can drive the bus on how, how and when you get these done. And then, you know, here are kind of the times that I'll be doing things with you to work around those. And then that's also just worked well, you know, that that like when they're doing their own things, that gives me some time to go work. Because I work from home. And then, you know, I work a lot in the afternoon when they're done with school.

Ela Bass (26:37.034)
That's awesome.

Yeah, that's awesome. So you mentioned Savvy and I want to get into this really quickly, but Savvy is an awesome resource. It's available in the open ed marketplace and so families can get it very quickly, very easily. But why did you start Savvy initially?

Janssen Bradshaw (26:56.014)
So my oldest daughter was such an E like she really learned to read early and so well, like when she went into kindergarten, she was testing it like a 12th grade read error level reading level. She was just picked up reading really easily and early. I mean, I worked with her, but it wasn't like crazy, you know. Anyway, so I just kind of assumed that's how it would be for all of my kids. And then my second daughter, she struggled a lot. mean,

Ela Bass (27:07.829)
Wow.

Janssen Bradshaw (27:25.49)
I started working with her when she was like three, know, her letters, you know, two or three with her letters and sounds and kind of all the same things I'd done with my oldest child. And she was, it was just not clicking for, you know, and I thought, do I need to be worried about this? Is this too early? You know, like, is this just within normal? You know, it's hard to tell with your other kids, like with my other child, just so far ahead that I have, you know, an unclear vision of this. Anyway, in first grade, about halfway through first grade, her teacher,

when we went in for a parent teacher conference was like, she is barely at grade level, like the very lowest that we can call at grade level. And she's drifting farther down every time we, you know, she's like, you know, she's not even like staying level. She's getting closer and closer to that. And she's like, by the end of the year at this trajectory, she is going to be quite a bit behind. And, you know, if you know a lot about reading,

Ela Bass (28:07.114)
Wow.

Janssen Bradshaw (28:21.996)
Those are crucial years. Like if you get to third grade, by the end of third grade and you are not a competent reader, most kids never catch up after that because now you're not teaching reading, you're teaching everything else assuming, now we're doing history and I just assume you can read the assignments. What they call it is like the first couple of years are learn to read and then after that it's read to learn. So I was like, yikes.

Ela Bass (28:41.632)
Janssen Bradshaw (28:51.808)
Okay, now I have someone who is looking at a lot of kids who knows like what kind of benchmarks we're looking at who is saying there is a problem here, you know, and that was kind of a slap in the face to realize like, okay, if we don't change something here, this is really going to become a bigger problem. And I was already starting to see that with her. My second daughter is extremely bright. Like it was not like she was not smart, but it was learning to read is just really hard for some kids. And for her, was really difficult. And

That was making her feel like she was dumb, which was not true. It made her feel like she didn't like school. She was starting to disengage with school because it was hard for her. so, you know, this was, we were like, this is not something we're going to sit back and let just happen. So the teacher recommended that she

Ela Bass (29:28.608)
Wow!

Janssen Bradshaw (29:39.218)
start working with a tutor that the school, it was actually just an intern, a college student who was doing an internship there, but she would come in and work with her one-on-one for a little bit every day. And within a few weeks, we were starting to see major progress with that individualized help. And then it was COVID, everything shut down. But like the second week of COVID, when it kind of became clear, like these schools are not opening anytime soon. the teacher emailed me and she was like, Hey, this intern,

still would like to get her hours in so she could do the same thing she was doing but just online you know and so my daughter was very resistant to working with me or my husband you know she'd get frustrated easily you know she just did not want to do it but she would get on with this you know probably 22 year old intern 19 year old intern maybe i don't know young woman and

This was let me tell you, this was not an engaging, exciting thing. This was like a white screen with black words on it, you know, and let's just practice words. And she would get on with no complaint. I remember that summer we went down to visit my parents and she was swimming and I said, come on in, it's time for you to this. And she just like got out of the pool and got on with her and like, she just put up no resistance and she was making so much progress so quickly. Anyway, so I mentioned this online, you know, on my Instagram account that we had.

that we were doing this and she was making a lot of progress. And all these people were like, can you put me in contact with her? Would she had taken on other students? I'm like, this is like, this is so low level. I can't even tell you how not like exciting this kind of thing is. But, know, as my husband and I were seeing what great progress she was making with someone that was not us. And it wasn't long. It was like 15 to 20 minutes a day, but it was so consistent. And she was suddenly like,

making these huge strides. were like, there is something here and there are people who are interested in this. So there's a guy that my husband had worked with at Intel. They both worked at Intel and his wife was a reading instructor. And so during COVID she had been helping kids in the neighborhood with their reading practice. And so Jeremy, the husband was like, I think we could maybe scale this anyway. So he's having this experience and we're having this experience.

Janssen Bradshaw (31:58.358)
So are these two husbands, they would usually get on a phone call every couple of months now that they had both left Intel and were working on different startups and just kind of talk like, what kind of businesses are you thinking about or what seems interesting? Anyway, so, you know, Jeremy says, hey, I think Amy's onto something here. that she, no, I mean, she has a master's. She's like, so in this world of teaching reading, if we could make this available to more kids. And my husband's like, actually,

I have a vision of what this could look like because we're seeing this, these like 20 to 25 minute classes and, you know, personalized instruction right at your level. I think we could make something of this. so we started working on that. This was in like June of 2020 and we launched in the fall of 2020. So, you know, within months and, you know, so I, I got on my blog and Instagram and I said, like, we're going to launch this program. We're opening up.

Ela Bass (32:47.678)
Wow!

Janssen Bradshaw (32:56.558)
pre-sales for it. And we thought if we can get 10 people to sign up, this is probably worth doing. If we can get 20 people, then we're really in business. But 10 people, we would still be able to make this work. Anyway, we had more than 100 people sign up. mean, Susan and I have done a lot of businesses. Like most things do not take off like that. So we were like, whoa, there really is a lot of interest. And then within just a few weeks of launching, I mean, we were just getting these rave reviews like,

Ela Bass (33:10.932)
Wow. my gosh.

Janssen Bradshaw (33:25.994)
you know, my kid has been, you know, cried and screamed and been so unhappy about any reading practice and they get on and they do savvy and they love it and they're making progress and they're picking up books on their own for the first time ever and they're saying that this is fun. I mean, it was just, I mean, it was kind of a magical experience where we were just like, there is really something here. You know, now we've been running savvy for five years and we now have savvy math. Also, we've expanded grades and I'm, I'm

I get a lot of feedback on my Instagram account and blog about all kinds of things. And no messages are like messages I get about savvy where people are like, this changed my child's life. Like if you cannot read all of school, you feel like you are stupid. You feel like you are behind. You feel like school is not for you. You just disengage. And when you start to feel like, I can do this. I can figure this out. I can learn this.

That is a life changing experience for a child. to get to be a part of that has been so special. you know, we saw that with our own daughter. she, you know, I've mentioned this many times over the years and a couple of, you know, years ago, somebody said to me, does this embarrass your daughter for you to talk about what a hard time she had reading? And so I said to her, like, is this embarrassing for you that I, for me to share this? Are you okay with me sharing this? And she said,

She was, I think in fourth grade at the time, like eight or nine. And she was like, why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it. And I was like, that is what you want. Like to not see that something is hard for you and that you give up or that it just crushes you, but that you run into something hard. Like I feel like for that daughter of mine, she now knows like if something was hard.

It's one thing for your parent or your teacher to be like, you're smart, you can do hard things. It is another thing for a child to know this was really hard for me and I fully conquered it. And I am now like in fifth grade, she was, she did some school testing in fifth grade and she was reading in 11th grade level. Like this is not me telling her how smart she is or how hard she can work. She knows 100 % with certainty and proof that she can do hard things. And if that things are hard for her, that doesn't mean that she gives up.

Ela Bass (35:33.631)
Wow.

Janssen Bradshaw (35:45.678)
That doesn't mean that she can never get good at it. Like she has more confidence in herself than she ever would have had without that challenge. So it's just, and so to see that not just for her, for thousands and thousands of other kids has been so, I mean, it's just been so cool to be part of it. I feel so lucky.

Ela Bass (36:04.362)
I honestly, so rewarding I bet.

Janssen Bradshaw (36:06.454)
Yeah, it really is. I mean, you just feel like what could I be doing that is making more of a difference than this that affects the trajectory of your whole life.

Ela Bass (36:14.836)
And that's so interesting and just like so beautiful that you started with books, like you loved books. And then all of a sudden you have this daughter that has a hard time reading and now you build this company. And it's just like this very really cool full circle moment where, you you help her to do the thing that you love. It is so aligned with who you are. And it obviously screams through. I'm curious, what is it about Savvy that makes it so good for students?

What is it about it that makes it different? Because you mentioned the individualized help, right? And that, you know, sometimes kids don't really want to learn from their parents at times. And that's probably definitely helpful. But like, what else about it makes it actually work for kids? Because usually, this is one of those challenges. It's usually math and it's usually reading that are the two challenges that are like, I just cannot get through this. What is it about savvy that breaks through?

Janssen Bradshaw (37:14.744)
So I think the number one thing about savvy is that it meets you where you are. You know, that is hard to do in a class. Doesn't matter how good the teacher is. If you have 25 or 30 kids in there, it is going to be almost impossible for you to meet every kid where they are. And every kid is at a different level. you know, for savvy, you are having reading or math instruction right where you are. And you're, you know, our goal is to always hit that perfect mark of if it's too easy, it's boring. Right. And you're just.

Ela Bass (37:22.048)
Mm-hmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (37:44.716)
You know, checked out what's going on out the window. And if it's too hard, you're also checked out. Like it's too frustrating and you just give up. And so you want to have it just at that spot where it's giving you just enough challenge. You know, you think of it like skiing. If you're like a medium skier, you don't want to ski the bunny hill, like boring, you know, but you also don't put me on a double black diamond because I'm just going to like, there's no chance I'm probably going to die. You know, I want to be on just the hill that gives me just enough challenge to feel like this is fun. I'm pushing myself a little, but.

Ela Bass (38:00.33)
Mm-hmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (38:14.624)
It's also easy enough that I can do it and not get really hurt or be so frustrated. And so savvy does that really well of meeting you exactly where you are, where you're always in that, you know, flow is the term that we use for that, where you're just in that, where it's really engaging and you're like, yes, I want to keep doing this without, you know, tapping out on either side because you're either bored or frustrated. So I think that's number one. Two, it's so interactive.

I mean, kids love attention. And so to have a teacher that is there like in real time talking to you and engaging with you like that, I mean, humans are just so wired for connection. So to have that time where it's not like, now you go do this whole thing on your own for the next 30 minutes and then we'll check in, know, and you're like, I'm done. And then I would say the, so that teacher connection is so big and we're so lucky with Savvy because...

I mean, we get so many applicants. We probably hire one in 10. So we get to be so picky and just get the best of the best teachers. mean, these are teachers who are so skilled and love kids and love teaching and they live for that like connection moment where a kid's like, I get it. I can do this. Like I've suddenly figured this out that I've never been able to do before, you know, and that is, so we just have amazing teachers. And then I would say the third thing is that consistency.

you know, I mean, we're all like this, right? I want to go to the gym and I'm going to work out for two hours every six months, you know, like you're just not going to get anywhere. And so to have this like four days a week, but it's not 25 minute classes. So it's long enough that you're really getting great instruction, but not so long that you kind of start to check out. So you're just getting that. mean, it's like going to the gym five days a week and you know, you don't have to be there for three hours, but if you're at, you know, 45 minutes at the gym,

four or five days a week, you're gonna really make some good progress. So I think those are kind of the three secret sauces of, and you know, as a parent, especially if you're homeschooling and you have other kids, like that consistency can be really challenging. You're like, you know, and we hear this from people all the time who are like, okay, I've watched you talk about Savvy for four years and I know I've been meaning to sign up, but I just keep thinking I can do it myself and I keep not, and I keep falling farther and farther ahead. It is hard.

Janssen Bradshaw (40:35.16)
to manage that consistency on your own. so savvy really provides that in great way. And I think, you know, we have so many public school or charter school kids doing savvy too, but I think especially with homeschool, that also gives you a chance for your child to have that consistency, but also gives you a chance like, I can work with another child on this while my other child does savvy. And, know, so you can kind of break up and...

you know, kind of get that help that a lot of homeschool parents need if you're trying to balance a lot of kids and a lot of needs.

Ela Bass (41:06.034)
Yeah, and I love the point that you made earlier because I think like there's one school of thought that's like, okay, if a kid doesn't read, they'll read eventually. And like, you know, there's lots of people that promote that. But I do think that pointing out the fact that like, if you can help a kid, you know, if you can help them to make that a hot, if it's not just like the kid is absolutely, you know, bucking his head against every single possible potential thing that you're doing,

to help him read, it is helpful in teaching all of your other subjects, right? Like as a homeschooler, you do have a lot more flexibility than most students, you know, in a public school, like they're gonna give you a textbook and they're gonna be writing things on a board. But like as a homeschooler, you can lean into more auditory things and video and like, yeah, 100 % you have a lot more opportunities, but I love the emphasis on reading is a tool, especially at a certain point and

Like the longer that a kid does not read, you just like prolong them having that tool in their tool toolkit. like, is it detrimental to who they could become? I mean, you could argue no, like maybe eventually they'll learn and then they'll speed up really quickly. But like as many tools as we can give our kids as early on, like I think that's the sentiment that I've gotten from a lot of parents inside of OpenEd. It's just like, I just want to open as many doors for my kids as I possibly can.

Janssen Bradshaw (42:32.642)
Bye.

Ela Bass (42:33.278)
And I love the fact that that y'all are helping kids to do that because it's so true. Like kids love people that love them. And like that's something that I've seen, especially in the micro school movement, like kids that did not love school are starting to love school because their teachers actually care about them personally. And so what it sounds like is that y'all have people that make the kid feel special and that like actually want to be there and are actually really amazing teachers that are really excited when a kid learns something and

From the receiving end, that is so different than anything else. And yeah, I just find this so, so, so cool. From your perspective, what has been the most rewarding thing for you just like in this whole journey of reading all these book recommendations that you're doing? You've been very consistent for the past 20 years, which is actually incredible. And now building Savvy, what has been the most rewarding aspect of the journey for you?

Janssen Bradshaw (43:30.124)
I think reading is just so magical and just gives you experiences and views into the world. And sometimes that's like great literature and you're just like, whoa, now I'm like part of the club that's Pride and Prejudice or Animal Farm or whatever. And sometimes it's just like, I just read this fluffy romance and remembered again, just like the sheer joy of getting lost in someone else's life. It can be that whole spectrum.

And I think, you know, on the side of savvy, it's like opening that world for kids where they get to experience that. And then I would say for everyday reading, the thing for me like that I love most is when I get messages from people who are like, I was a huge bookworm growing up or I never read growing up and now I'm 37 and I've just like now read 10 books this year and I haven't read a book.

for fun in 25 years, you know, that like either they rediscover that part of them or for the first time they got like the door opened into the world. And so if I get a chance to like open that door for them, whether they've been there before or not is really magical, you know, like it's like you've just given someone a whole new like world to live in and that I feel really lucky to get to do that.

Ela Bass (44:49.522)
That's beautiful. A lot of parents inside of the open end marketplace have lots of options and that's something that I've heard a lot of them say is kind of stifling at times. It's like, okay, you know, for reading help, I could go to all these different 10 providers. What makes savvy learning so good and who do you think it's most for?

Janssen Bradshaw (45:09.912)
So I think Savvy works really well for three kinds of students. One is a struggling student who is just like, I hate it, I hate reading, I hate books, I hate math, know, all those things. For them to start to have positive experiences with that is really life changing, you know? And in a way that doesn't make them feel like I'm...

not smart, I'm behind, like it's like, you are where you are, you know, like I took up skiing, you know, we moved to Utah with and so I had not grown up skiing at all. And I was like, okay, if we're gonna live in Utah, I better learn to ski. And you know,

No, none of the instructors were like, I can't believe you're 35 and you don't know how to ski. You know, they're like, great. You are now at the ready to learn, you know, and we're going to meet you right where you are. And so I think savvy is so great for that. If you if you just on a really poor trajectory where you're like, I, you know, I hate reading, I hate books, I hate math, all the things that that can change that trajectory. So that's, you know, child number one, I think that it works really well for.

I think child number two, that especially savvy reading works well for is kids that are competent, but they don't love reading. they can do it. They're fine. They're a grade level. You know, the teacher's like, yes, fine. You know, they're not a struggling reader necessarily, but to really help them discover a love of reading it. Like savvy is really good at making it fun and engaging. And so

I love to see parents who are like, hey, it was hard for me to decide if I wanted to do savvy because they weren't so obviously, you know, if your child is nine and can barely read three letter words, you know there's a problem. It's a little less easy to see that there's a problem if your child's like basically on grade level, but just kind of like, meh, you know, so.

Ela Bass (46:55.636)
Mm-hmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (47:04.309)
you know, just to circle back to what we were saying earlier about homeschool, like one of my biggest goals is for kids to have a love of learning and to want to learn. I mean, humans are wired to learn. and so I think savvy really can help kids suddenly discover this like, this is interesting. This is fun. This is engaging. Even if I kind of knew the basic fundamentals, but now I can do it. And then I would say the third one is for kids who are way ahead. And this is especially maybe if you're in public school.

And so you're kind of checked out a little bit at school in either reading or math that you're like, I'm just way ahead of this. And so I'm kind of bored by all of this at school because I'm ahead of this savvy can meet those kids where they are. So, you know, my second daughter was struggling a lot. so savvy was kind of helping her pull up from the bottom. My third daughter was a very advanced reader and very advanced in math. And so savvy.

you know, she was doing it while she was in public school. And so it gave her a challenge that she wasn't really having in public school, where she could be at the level she was and move at a much faster, higher pace. And so I think for a child like that, who is like anxious to learn and loves to learn to have, you know, that really fun engaging experience at their level instead of kind of waiting all the time or like, yeah, I know that I get that.

That's a really great experience, too. So those are kind of the three things and I would say just as kind of a fourth one We hear a lot kids who are a competent reader, you know You show them words on the page and they can read it, but they struggle with comprehension Like what was that about? I actually have no idea. I can't answer these questions about it savvy especially, you know, about third fourth fifth sixth grade levels is very focused on Comprehension because what good is it if you can read the words on the page, but you don't know what?

Ela Bass (48:42.88)
Mmm.

Janssen Bradshaw (48:56.854)
You can't make any meaning out of them. I could read words in Italian because it uses the same alphabet. I could say those words, but they would mean nothing to me. so Savvy is really great for helping kids who need that comprehension help too.

Ela Bass (49:14.218)
That's amazing. Yeah, I've literally loved every single thing that you've said. I'm hit you with a couple of rapid fire questions. And then maybe we can do a part two of this, because you have so many things to say. So rapid fire number one, what is one reading habit that you would recommend for all open ed families to adopt?

Janssen Bradshaw (49:18.114)
Right.

Okay.

Janssen Bradshaw (49:31.702)
I would say audio books. feel like they are magical. This, you said rapid fire, and I'm gonna give you a long answer, but I feel like the best thing we did for my second daughter when she was struggling so much with reading is that it was very compartmentalized too, that reading was hard for her, but she still loved books and stories. She had very high comprehension. She listened to a ton of audio books. even though she couldn't read the words on the page very well,

she could listen and follow along to these much more complicated stories. And then when she did start getting the reading help that she needed first with this individual intern and then through Savvy, she could put those parts together pretty quickly once she had good instruction because she understood the fundamentals of how stories and words and vocabulary all work. I mean, my kids listen to, we listen to audio books in the car as a family on road trips or just one word, know.

go to the grocery store and they listen to audiobooks at night and they listen to audiobooks during the day, you know, while they do any other other projects. So I feel like audiobooks are such an underutilized tool that teach so many good reading skills that help with the actual mechanics of reading with your eyes on a page.

Ela Bass (50:45.908)
That's amazing. I love that recommendation. And I think that that goes into the thing that you were saying before about giving them this like introducing them to this new world of ideas and getting them curious about all these different things. If especially your kid has a some sort of an issue with reading, it is amazing to be able to get them really invested in the world of reading. So then, you know, they actively want to learn to read as well. Second question. What is your current favorite series?

I'm thinking about this in terms of what are good gifts to give this season.

Janssen Bradshaw (51:21.358)
If you ask me about 2025 reading, for me it's the unselected journals of Emma M. Lyon. Have you heard of these? Okay, so they kind of have a...

Ela Bass (51:28.288)
I have not.

Janssen Bradshaw (51:33.258)
Like Pride and Prejudice meets Anne of Green Gables meets Little Women kind of like old-fashioned feel but they're new. I mean this is an adult series but my 12 and 15 year olds are super into them and my 10 year olds actually listed quite a few of them too. My husband's listened to them. They're just, it's about this young woman who lives in London. She's an orphan and you know just kind of the ridiculous things going on in her life. It's an 1880s London. It's witty, it's fun, it's got some romance. It's just

Ela Bass (51:37.376)
Cute!

Fully delightful. It is a slow start, especially on paper. think the audio books are a little easier to get into. It took me a couple of books to get into, but so many people have been like, this is the best series I've ever read. I was like, okay, I gotta keep going. And then I finished it and I went back and read the whole series again. And now I'm listening to the whole series again. It's so fun. It's really, really a fun series.

That's good to know. I know everybody's asking like what are the best recommendations for gifts right now? And actually your Instagram is full of them. So if any families need more recommendations, go check that out. Last rapid fire question. What is your recommendation? I know that you mentioned this earlier, but keeping up with reading as a busy mom is very, very, very difficult. What is your best recommendation for them?

Janssen Bradshaw (52:43.496)
One, same as the first question, audiobooks. I love audiobooks and I think they're just such a great way to engage with books when you don't have time to sit down. I also am a huge Kindle lover. Like to be able to take a book on the go and pick it up anytime, get library books delivered there in three seconds, really has helped my reading life. And then I also, this is my third suggestion is to.

put your phone to bed in a different room if you can. So I put my phone to bed in my office and then like once I go into my bedroom at night, like I'm not distracted by it. I can pick up my book and you know, instead of like, you if my phone was sitting there every and asked me how I know because I did this for 10 years, like I read one page and I'm like, I wonder if anything interesting has happened on Instagram. I should text that, I should check on that thing on Google, you know? So like having my phone in a different room in the evening is very helpful for me.

Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (53:34.214)
Mm-hmm. That's a great recommendation. Something that I've been doing too is I got myself one of those bricks, like the... And that has been helpful because I'll go to my phone and everything's locked and I'm like, my gosh, okay, I might as well read. Well, this has been amazing. Where can people find you if they want to learn more or go follow your Instagram and blog and all your recommendations?

Janssen Bradshaw (53:46.254)
Totally.

My Instagram is Everyday Reading and then my blog is [Everyday-Reading.com](http://everyday-reading.com/). so those are the two main places and I just love talking about books. I feel like it's just the dream job to be able to connect with people all the time who want to ask the same question. What series should I try out or how can I fit in more reading? Like those are the things I want to talk about all the time.

That's amazing. And then if you're an open ed family or if you're not, definitely go check out Savvy Learning and we'll link it in the description as well. But it is an amazing tool. We have loved it and we've loved offering it to families. And I know that tons of families have given us great, great feedback on it. So thank you so much for coming on the podcast and hopefully we can do it again sometime.
