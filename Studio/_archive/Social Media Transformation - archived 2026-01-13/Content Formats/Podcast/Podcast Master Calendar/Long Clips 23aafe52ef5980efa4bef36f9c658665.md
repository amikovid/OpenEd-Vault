## **Long Form 1 — “The Bell That Broke the Spell”**

### Title:

- “The Moment I Realized School Was Hurting My Son”
- “Why My Child Came Home Crying Every Night”
- “When the School Bell Became Too Loud to Ignore”
- “How One Sound Made Me Pull My Son Out of School”
- “What Happened When I Finally Listened to My Child’s Fear”

### Description:

In this heart-wrenching and eye-opening story, former public-school teacher **Keri Mae** shares the moment she realized her autistic son’s school environment was doing more harm than good. What begins as a parent’s attempt to advocate for accommodations becomes an awakening about how the system often fails the very kids who need compassion most.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** You were kind of sharing your story a little bit. You have three kids, you do open education, but you do it as a single parent. You wanted to talk about how there’s still opportunity to personalize your kids’ education even when you have constraints. Can you tell me a little bit about your children’s educational story?

**Keri Mae:** Yeah. I have three boys — they’re six, ten, and twelve. I was a public-school educator for quite a while; I taught kindergarten and have a degree in early childhood development. That was really important to me. I wanted an education congruent with what kids *actually need* to thrive.

So I shopped around for the best public school I could find. My oldest did fine — he’s the typical high-achieving, checks-the-boxes kid. But my middle child is autistic, and that changed everything.

He started in public school, and we quickly realized there were challenges. He has auditory-processing issues. The bell — that loud, jarring bell — terrified him. He began having night terrors, wetting the bed, waking up crying, covering his ears, saying, “It’s too loud! It’s too loud!”

We talked with the principal and teachers, tried noise-canceling headphones — but then he couldn’t hear when recess ended, so he’d be left outside with the older kids. Nothing worked. Eventually the administration said, *“Maybe public school just isn’t right for him.”*

As a parent — and as a teacher — that broke me. I had this vision of what school would be: class parties, field trips, all the magic I loved about teaching. But that was the beginning of the end of traditional schooling for our family.

## **Long Form 2 — “The Whiteboard Moment”**

### Title:

- “The Kindergarten Zoom That Changed Everything”
- “When My Son Wrote: ‘You Are All Stupid’”
- “Why I Stopped Trying to Make School Work”
- “How Remote Learning Broke the Illusion for Me”
- “The Day I Realized My Child Wasn’t the Problem”

### Description:

During remote learning, Keri Mae’s kindergartener had had enough — and what he wrote on his whiteboard nearly exposed the truth she’d been ignoring. This story captures the absurdity of trying to fit exceptional kids into standardized boxes, and the moment a mother decided to trust her instincts instead of the system.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Keri Mae:** …So when the pandemic hit, I was forced into figuring it out. My autistic son thrives on consistency — and suddenly there was none. Some days there was school, some days there wasn’t. We’d find out the morning of.

One day they were on Zoom doing phonics — “B says what?” All the kids are saying *ba-ba-bear* and writing it on whiteboards. My son was in kindergarten, but he was academically advanced. He’s writing *full sentences* already.

And this was kind of an embarrassing moment for me as a mom — he writes in perfect punctuation and capitalization: **“You are all stupid.”** Period.

He was so frustrated. He’s thinking, *Why am I sitting here talking about letters? I can already read and write.* I caught him just before he held it up to the camera — “No!” — and set it down.

But that was my turning point. I realized, *We’re not doing this anymore.* I pulled him out and said, “I’ll teach him myself.”

It was hard — I was working from home and trying to homeschool — but it planted a seed. It showed me there were resources and communities out there. And more than that, it showed me my child wasn’t broken — the system was.

## **Long Form 3 — “Why We Do This: Love as the Curriculum”**

### Title:

- “Why I Chose Open Education: It All Comes Down to Love”
- “What I Never Want My Kids to Feel About Learning”
- “How Love Became Our Curriculum”
- “The Real Reason I Left the System”
- “What Every Teacher Forgets About Kids”

### Description:

In a moving close to the episode, Keri Mae reveals the real motivation behind her choices — not ideology, but love. She describes the heartbreak of watching children lose their spark, and her mission to protect curiosity and confidence through open education.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

**Ela Richmond:** Why open education? Though your kids aren’t all doing the same thing, you’ve made this a value in your home. Why?

**Keri Mae:** The biggest why is love. That’s it. At the end of the day, I love my children. I love children in general — that’s what got me into education in the first place.

I see these little people, so ripe and ready to absorb the world. They come in with this vibrancy — and it’s heartbreaking to see it squashed. To hear a five-year-old say, *“I hate school,”* or *“I can’t read.”*

You came in with such joy — what happened?

I wanted to offer something better. Not just for my own kids, but for every child who enters a classroom. I wanted them to leave excited, confident, hungry to learn more.

And really, that’s what love does. Whatever you love, you want to share. I love learning. I’m a lifelong learner — always asking, *What can I explore next?* That curiosity, that joy — I want my kids to feel that, too.

I didn’t want them to internalize that *they* were the problem when it’s the system that’s broken. I wanted them to know they were never the problem — they were always the possibility.
