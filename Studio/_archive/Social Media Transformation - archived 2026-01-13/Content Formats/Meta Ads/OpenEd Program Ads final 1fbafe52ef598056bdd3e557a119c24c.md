**Headline:** "Your OpenEd Spot Is Waiting"

**Description:** "Complete enrollment in minutes"

## Copy for the Attached "Apply Today" Image

### Option 1: Direct & Clear

**Header:** "Complete Your OpenEd Journey"
**Subheader:** "You started your application. Now let's finish together."

### Option 2: Urgency-Focused

**Header:** "Finish What You Started"
**Subheader:** "Your OpenEd enrollment expires in 40 days."

### Option 3: Supportive

**Header:** "Ready to Complete Your Enrollment?"
**Subheader:** "We saved your progress. Jump back in anytime."

### Option 4: Benefit-Focused

**Subheader:** "Complete enrollment to unlock your benefits."

### Option 5: Simple CTA (Recommended)

**Header:** "Complete Your Application"
**Subheader:** "Secure your spot for the 2025-26 school year."

**Note:** The current subheader "Start your online business journey" should definitely be changed since OpenEd is about education, not business. Option 5 would be my recommendation for clarity and alignment with the campaign goals.
