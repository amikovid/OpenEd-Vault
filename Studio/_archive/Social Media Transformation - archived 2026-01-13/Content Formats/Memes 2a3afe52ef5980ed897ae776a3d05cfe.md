# Memes

Text: The content format focuses on meme creation for multiple platforms (Facebook, X, Instagram, LinkedIn) with a cadence of three posts per week. It includes a "Meme of the Week" crossover in newsletters and utilizes various sources like X, Pinterest, and original content. The guidelines for creating memes emphasize taking a concept, fitting it into a popular meme format, experimenting with ten variations, and selecting the best one. There is potential for repurposing with short, slightly variable captions.
