# Notes from Andrew

Kickoff Call - Social Media Content Strategy: A Comprehensive Guide (1)

## Chapter 1: The Fundamentals of Social Media Marketing

### Traditional Marketing Pillars Reimagined

Historically, marketing has been built on two core pillars:

- **Storytelling**: The narrative and message you communicate
- **Reach**: How many people will hear your message

### The Social Media Revolution

Traditional marketing was characterized by:

- Expensive content creation
- Astronomical media buying costs
- Limited ability to reach target audiences

**Social Media Transformation:**

- Democratized content creation
- Algorithmic content distribution
- Ability to "earn awareness" without massive budgets

### The Interest Graph Paradigm

**Key Insight:** Modern social media platforms prioritize interest-based content distribution over follower-based models.

### Platform Evolution

- **Old Model:** Content shown primarily to followers
- **New Model (TikTok's Innovation):** Content distributed to like-minded individuals based on:
    - Topic relevance
    - User interests
    - Content characteristics

## Chapter 2: Understanding Platform Algorithms

### Content Identification Strategies

Platforms use multiple methods to understand and categorize content:

### 1. On-Screen Text

- Deliberately use relevant keywords
- Think of it like SEO for social media
- Be specific and intentional about language

### 2. Description Copy

- Stuff descriptions with relevant topic keywords
- Create copy that helps algorithms understand content
- Don't rely solely on natural language

### 3. Hashtags

- Use strategically (around 12 hashtags)
- Help guide algorithmic understanding
- Choose hashtags that accurately represent content

### 4. Audio/Spoken Content

- Platforms transcribe and analyze audio
- Speak keywords and topics explicitly
- Use audio as another layer of content identification

### Watch Time and Retention Mechanics

### Critical Metrics

- **Watch Time:** How long users watch your content
- **Retention Rate:** Percentage of content watched

### Capturing Audience Attention

**The 2-Second Rule:**

- First 1-2 seconds are crucial
- Create immediate, compelling hooks
- Prevent viewers from scrolling away

**Strategies for High Retention:**

- Start with drama or intrigue
- Ask compelling questions
- Use unexpected openings
- Maintain high energy
- Deliver value quickly

## Chapter 3: Creative Content Approaches

**Golden Rule:** Create content that keeps viewers watching and wanting more.

## Chapter 4: Content Production and Publishing Strategy

The Publishing Philosophy
**Core Principle:** Post as often as possible - ideally daily content, Monday through Sunday.

Why Frequent Publishing Works

1. **Social Media as Focus Group**
    - Each post tests audience preferences
    - Immediate feedback on messaging and strategy
    - Rapid iteration and learning cycles
2. **The Home Run Strategy**
    - Most growth comes from viral hits, not consistent base hits
    - More at-bats = more opportunities for breakthrough content
    - Compound effect when viral content drives archive exploration
3. **Archive Building Benefits**
    - New followers explore past content
    - Compounding views across entire catalog
    - Creates sustainable content ecosystem

Optimal Posting Strategy
**Timing Considerations:**

- Identify peak audience activity times through platform analytics
- Post 1-2 hours before peak times to allow algorithmic processing
- Allow platforms time to understand and categorize content

**Content Testing Approach:**

- Publish quickly when content is ready
- Don't over-schedule - stay engaged with real-time response
- Monitor engagement velocity in first 15 minutes
- Be present in comments immediately after posting

Platform Focus Strategy
**Primary Platforms (Same Content, Multiple Channels):**

- Instagram Reels
- TikTok
- YouTube Shorts
- Facebook Reels

**Why These Platforms:**

- Strong algorithmic promotion for video content
- Similar content requirements across platforms
- Maximum reach with minimal additional effort

## Chapter 5: Production Methodology and Asset Management

Production Asset Audit
**Key Questions to Answer:**

- What human resources are available?
- What technical capabilities exist?
- What content archives can be leveraged?
- What are the friction points in current processes?

Available Asset Categories

1. **Human Resources**
    - Organizational thought leaders
    - Happy customers and testimonials
    - Employee families
    - Subject matter experts
2. **Content Archives**
    - Podcast episodes (aim for 20-30 clips per episode)
    - Previous media appearances
    - Speaking engagements
    - Customer success stories
3. **Technical Resources**
    - AI voice tools
    - Stock footage libraries
    - Editing capabilities
    - Recording equipment

Friction Elimination Strategy
**Core Philosophy:** Speed and consistency trump technical perfection.

**Friction Reduction Tactics:**

- Identify and eliminate production bottlenecks
- Optimize for daily publishing capability
- Choose tools and processes that minimize resistance
- Prioritize content volume over production value

The Podcast-to-Clips Pipeline
**Strategic Approach:** Podcasts exist primarily to feed short-form content.

**Process Framework:**

1. **Pre-Recording Preparation**
    - Develop talking points focused on clip-worthy moments
    - Brief speakers on creating quotable, energetic segments
    - Plan for multiple topic areas per session
2. **Recording Optimization**
    - Capture both audio and video when possible
    - Use portable recording equipment for flexibility
    - Encourage passionate, quotable delivery
3. **Content Extraction**
    - Target 15-30 second clips for maximum impact
    - Look for emotional peaks and key insights
    - Create multiple clips per podcast episode

## Chapter 6: Brand Integration and Multi-Property Strategy

Subliminal Branding Techniques
**Verbal Branding:**

- Consistently mention brand names in content
- Create natural integration opportunities
- Build brand recognition through repetition

**Visual Branding:**

- Subtle logo placement in backgrounds
- Consistent color schemes and aesthetics
- Branded clothing in video appearances

Multi-Property Content Strategy
**Unified Brand Approach:**

- Focus on building primary brand recognition
- Integrate sub-brands and offerings naturally
- Maintain consistent messaging across all properties

**Content Distribution for Multiple Offerings:**

- Use algorithmic targeting to reach different audience segments
- Create content that serves multiple business lines
- Let platform algorithms determine optimal audience matching

Avoiding Over-Segmentation
**Key Principle:** Don't create separate social media accounts unless absolutely necessary.

**Benefits of Unified Approach:**

- Consolidated audience building
- Simplified content production
- Cross-pollination between different offerings
- Stronger overall brand presence

Technical and Creative Balance
**Technical Requirements:**

- Prioritize watch time and retention
- Maximize engagement signals (shares, saves, comments)
- Ensure content is easily identifiable by algorithms
- Post at optimal times for audience

**Creative Requirements:**

- Think like an influencer, not a big brand
- Create platform-native content
- Always prioritize audience entertainment and value
- Make content production as easy as possible

The key to success lies in balancing these technical and creative elements while maintaining consistency and frequency in publishing.

## Chapter 7: Advanced Content Optimization Techniques

The "Junk Food for Information" Philosophy
**Core Principle:** Content must be perfectly consumable, not pixel perfect.

**The Twinkie Analogy:**

- Focus on designed consumption over perfect ingredients
- Prioritize message clarity over cinematic aesthetics
- Choose tools and techniques that "get out of their own way"

Rapid-Fire Editing Strategies
**The Ruthless Cut Approach:**

- Remove every awkward start, breath, and pause
- Cut out redundant sentences and filler words
- Eliminate anything that doesn't drive the narrative forward
- Be willing to make 75+ cuts in a single video

**Exercise for Mastery:**

1. Take any piece of content
2. Cut it down as aggressively as possible (don't plan to publish)
3. Remove every blink, stumble, and "um"
4. Push beyond your comfort zone
5. Dial back slightly for the final version

**Advanced Cutting Techniques:**

- Cut between different zoom levels on the same shot
- Add subtle background music to maintain energy
- Use jump cuts to create urgency and momentum
- Make content move too fast to fully comprehend on first viewing (encouraging rewatches)

Text-Based Hook Strategies
**Hook Categories:**

1. **Teaser Hooks**
    - "Her boyfriend freaked out..."
    - "What happened next will shock you..."
    - "The third tip will blow your mind..."
2. **Promise Hooks**
    - "5 tips for perfect homeschooling"
    - "Three things every homeschool mom needs"
    - "The secret schools don't want you to know"
3. **Context Hooks**
    - Set up the topic immediately
    - Help viewers understand what they're watching
    - Bridge any gaps in opening content

**Text Hook Development Process:**

- Write 15 different potential titles/hooks
- Choose the most compelling options
- Test different approaches systematically
- Apply YouTube thumbnail/title psychology to short-form content

Chapter 8: Platform-Specific Technical Implementation

Instagram Collaboration Features
**Collaboration vs. Tagging:**

- **Tagging:** Simple mention, no approval needed
- **Collaboration:** Shared post requiring acceptance

**Collaboration Best Practices:**

- Coordinate acceptance within 60 seconds of posting
- Have collaborator ready to accept immediately
- If timing fails, default to simple tagging
- Late acceptance can hurt algorithmic performance

Trending Audio Discovery
**Effective Audio Research Method:**

1. Scroll through your platform's feed (Instagram Reels, TikTok, etc.)
2. Look for trending indicators (up arrows, trend markers)
3. Save audio that appears in your demographic's content
4. Avoid generic trending audio lists (often not audience-appropriate)

**Community-Specific Trending:**

- Different communities see different trending content
- Use accounts that match your target demographic
- Wedding industry trends differ from photography trends
- Stay within your content ecosystem for relevant audio

Advanced Production Techniques
**Single-Camera Enhancement:**

- Cut out all unnecessary content first
- Use zoom variations to create visual interest
- Add supporting background music tracks
- Match music mood to content tone (solemn, heartfelt, energetic)

**Music Selection Strategy:**

- Browse content similar to yours for audio inspiration
- Choose tracks that enhance rather than distract
- Consider emotional undertones of your message
- Test different audio styles for performance differences

## Chapter 9: Quality vs. Speed Balance

The Production Hierarchy
**Priority Order:**

1. Speed of publication
2. Message clarity
3. Audience engagement
4. Technical quality

**"Good Enough" Standards:**

- Readable fonts over designer fonts
- Clear message over perfect aesthetics
- Fast production over Hollywood quality
- Consistent publishing over sporadic perfection

Content Enhancement Without Bottlenecks
**Low-Friction Improvements:**

- Quick background music addition
- Simple zoom changes during cuts
- Text overlays for context/hooks
- Fast-paced editing to maintain energy

**High-Friction Activities to Avoid:**

- Sourcing extensive B-roll footage
- Complex motion graphics
- Time-intensive color correction
- Elaborate visual effects

The Frankenbite Philosophy
**Advanced Editing Permissions:**

- Cut and rearrange sentences for clarity
- Remove redundant information
- Construct improved narratives from raw footage
- Use AI tools (like Descript's overdub) for seamless transitions

**Ethical Boundaries:**

- Maintain original message intent
- Don't create misleading statements
- Enhance clarity without changing meaning
- Focus on better communication, not deception

Testing and Iteration Framework
**A/B Testing Approach:**

- Create multiple versions of successful content
- Test different editing styles on same audio
- Compare stock footage vs. original content performance
- Measure fast-cut vs. standard-paced editing results

**Performance Indicators:**

- Engagement velocity in first 15 minutes
- Watch time retention rates
- Share and save ratios
- Comment quality and quantity

Key Takeaway: Master the art of ruthless editing while maintaining authentic messaging. Speed and consistenc

# Social Media Caption Optimization Prompt

## The Challenge

Transform weak, generic on-screen captions into compelling hooks that make viewers stop scrolling and watch your content.

## Core Principles

### The McDonald's Test

**Rule**: Someone who works at McDonald's should be able to read and understand your headline instantly.

- Avoid fancy vocabulary ("quadratic formula" vs "stop raising entitled kids")
- Choose accessible language over impressive terminology
- Wider net = better performance, not worse quality

### Hook Psychology

Your on-screen text serves three critical functions:

1. **Immediate Context** - Tell viewers what they're watching from frame one
2. **Drama Injection** - Add tension when the opening lacks punch
3. **Search Optimization** - Help algorithms understand your content

## The Transformation Framework

### Before: Generic/Weak Captions

- "Adulting 101"
- "Fastest way to get kids interested in learning"
- "When schools don't trust parents to know their kids"
- "Important parenting advice"

### After: Compelling Hooks

- "My son's first job sucked. Perfect."
- "Your kid's Minecraft addiction is actually genius"
- "Stop raising kids who wait for permission"
- "Never give up on the weird kid"

## Hook Categories That Work

### 1. Polarizing Statements

- "Your kid's [negative thing] is actually genius"
- "Stop raising [undesirable trait] kids"
- "[Institution] operates like prisons"

### 2. Counter-Intuitive Reveals

- "My son's first job sucked. Perfect."
- "The worst experiences are the best teachers"
- "Every kid has genius hiding somewhere"

### 3. Direct Challenges

- "Never give up on the weird kid"
- "Don't judge the trench coat kid"
- "Make your kids love learning again"

### 4. Curiosity Gaps

- "Her boyfriend freaked out..." (for dramatic content)
- "The third tip will blow your mind"
- "Why can't kids go to the bathroom?" (use carefully - can create confusion)

## Optimization Process

### Step 1: Identify the Core Message

- What's the most compelling idea in this content?
- What would make someone stop scrolling?
- What's the "quiet part" we can say out loud?

### Step 2: Apply the Transformation

**From**: Technical/Educational → **To**: Emotional/Dramatic
**From**: Long Explanation → **To**: Punchy Statement
**From**: Inside Baseball → **To**: Universal Truth

### Step 3: Test for Accessibility

- Would this hook work for wealthy people AND working-class people?
- Can someone understand it in 2 seconds?
- Does it create immediate curiosity or emotion?

## Real Examples from Practice

### Minecraft Education Content

- **Weak**: "Fastest way to get kids interested in Minecraft"
- **Strong**: "Your kid's Minecraft addiction is actually genius"
- **Why it works**: Takes something parents worry about and reframes it positively

### Underdog Story Content

- **Weak**: "Student success story"
- **Strong**: "Never give up on the weird kid"
- **Why it works**: Every parent fears their kid might be the "weird one"

### Job Failure Story

- **Weak**: "Learning from bad experiences"
- **Strong**: "My son's first job sucked. Perfect."
- **Why it works**: Completely unexpected positive reaction to negative outcome

## Warning Signs of Weak Captions

- Uses industry jargon or fancy vocabulary
- Explains rather than intrigues
- Generic phrases everyone uses
- Too long to read quickly
- Doesn't create immediate emotional response

## The Ultimate Test

Before publishing, ask yourself:

1. Would this make ME stop scrolling if I saw it in my feed?
2. Does this create curiosity or emotion in the first 2 seconds?
3. Can my grandmother understand what this is about instantly?
4. Does this hint at the payoff without giving it away?

# June 3 (1)

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:47
If you have low view numbers, it's almost always because you couldn't get the click, not because the content was wrong. So I think about this with myself, like, anything under my follower count.

[Charlie Deist] 10:12:54
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:59
I just assume is poor packaging, not poor video. But we can dig into that video. If you click into the analytics on that video, um, do you mind… we can take a look. I pulled up the one you just published here, too.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:06
Yeah, let me see. Yeah, sure. Um…

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:12
We could help with that in a sec. Uh…

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:13
It does… it's higher retention than the average video. I did see that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:18
Um, and I can go… I'll go to the analytics on this one.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:19
Yeah, the analytics, yeah, right there, there we go. Um… So let's go to Reach.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:28
So click-through rate's 2.8%. So that's a pretty low click-through rate.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:33
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:33
Ideally, it's in between, like, 4 and 6. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:38
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:41
At above 6 is like, whoa, okay, great. So, like, my videos that have done better in the, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:49
10,000 view and up. Those have, like, a 7% to 8% click-through rate, but videos that are, like, just my talking vlogs, and, like, I didn't try super hard, sometimes those are in the 2-4% range.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:54
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:02
So, I would always try to get Um, because, like, so you… it got served to 10,000 people.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:03
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:09
Right? And only 2.8% of those people decided to click. And that's what you… that's your opportunity. That if you could get that number higher, so… Click-through rate is always a part of the title, thumbnail combination.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:10
Right. Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:17
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:26
And that's where I would go first, that…

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:26
Right, right. I mean, this thumbnail, looking at this thumbnail, this stinks on multiple levels. It's very vague, you have no idea what this video is about just from looking at the thumbnail, like…

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:35
Yeah, and this is an incredible art of, like, how do you make a thumbnail fantastic? You could… you could spend an entire career just doing this, as opposed to saying, hey, I'm a filmmaker. It's like, no, no, I'm just gonna concentrate on video editing.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:42
Yeah. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:48
And it's like, okay, so you're not a filmmaker, you're just a video editor. It's like, yeah, that's all I think about is video editing. Thumbnail design is the same thing, where creators are expected to, like, do it all.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:53
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:58
And the reality is, thumbnail is, like, a real serious thing. Let's go into engagement, too, real quick.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:03
Okay, this… well, now I just switched over to a different video.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:06
Oh, got it, got it, got it, okay. I mean, it's probably too early for this, but go back to reach real quick, then.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:08
Um, this… this is the most recent podcast where

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:16
So it's probably too early. Um, this was published when? Yesterday?

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:21
Yesterday at, like, 10 a.m. 9 a.m.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:22
Yeah… Yeah, I mean, it is… you still would expect to be higher, um… Let me just look at mine real quick.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:34
I obsess over the click-through numbers often, um, because… because I really feel like that's how I can win.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:38
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:43
Um, alright, so analytics… So I'm at 4% on my recent long-form video that I uploaded.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:52
Okay. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:52
And… and that's not… that's okay-ish. That's like, alright. I'm really on the far edge there.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:00
And then another video that did recently… I published it last week, it's a gear review video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:09
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:09
And the click-through rate is 6.9%. It's like, okay, rock and roll. That guy, that guy's on rails. That's gonna… I'm gonna get some serious views on that over a long enough timeline.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:16
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:20
And it's already at 7,000 views. Um, so I would really concentrate on that click-through rate.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:23
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:28
And that is entirely around… title and thumbnail.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:33
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:33
Um, I was just watching some videos about thumbnail design. I should send these videos to you. I think you'd really enjoy them. They're… yeah, they are really about… kind of like the… the psychology of what you're trying to do with a thumbnail, and then it's con… it's, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:49
It's working in combination to the title. So, like, you read the title, and then the thumbnail is offering you a little extra. Like, I'm working on a video right now, it's like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:53
Hmm. Okay. Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:58
6 months with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. And then my thumbnail is gonna be, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:05
It has one problem. And it's like, okay, shit, so what's the problem after 6 months? Like, those two things work together.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:07
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:13
So you kind of assume that people are seeing both, that they process them both.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:13
Hopefully… Yes. Yes.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:17
Kind of in real time, like, the way that we scan it, it's not like you're just seeing the title or just seeing the thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:18
Absolutely. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:23
Yep. And so, that's… that's one type of problem. Another type of problem is.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:29
I got 10,000 views, but when I look at my analytics, it drops off halfway through.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:36
And it's like, oh shit, what's going on there? What is the… why is the retention rate so low on that?

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:41
The retention rate's low because something happened there. You started talking about subscribers, like, hey, make sure to like and subscribe, and blah blah blah, hit the notification bell. Or some… maybe something, maybe you drifted and started talking about your family, who even knows?

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:51
But, like, there's a reason why someone left, and it's like, okay, I'm gonna avoid that problem next time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:56
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:57
And a classic thing is where people ask for subscribers and likes and everything at the end of the video, and that goes on for, let's say, 20 to 30 seconds.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:05
And you could see your retention rate go off a cliff.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:09
And it's like, shit, you should do that somewhere else, make it smaller so the video kind of ends.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:15
So then… then there's never an opportunity for people to leave. They slide right into the next video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:18:15
I see, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:21
Um, and so that's what… those are the two classic problems, that either no one clicked.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:27
And your views are not where they should be. Or people did click, but the retention rate is really, really low.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:33
And it's like, okay, so I could… and you can see, usually on a graph, they have a graph in there, where you can see, like, where people left.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:40
At what minute. So, thumbnail and title is what I would consider for any video that you think is doing poorly. And really.

[Charlie Deist] 10:18:41
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:50
You know, we wouldn't expect either of our accounts to get a million views, but we should all be capable of getting multi-thousand.

[Charlie Deist] 10:18:59
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:59
And so anything under a multi-thousand view. Um, I would say start evaluating. Look at that click-through rate, and if that click-through rate is below 4%, Um, or if it's below… or if it's at 4%, and you're like, I have a better idea for that one.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:13
Switch them, and, like, just upload… change the title, change a new thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:19
And see if you can get it back in the game.

[Charlie Deist] 10:19:21
Yeah, okay. Um, shifting gears a little bit, I wanted to talk about, kind of, my… A little bit of my overall content workflow with the daily, but also come to something in my notes from our first conversation where Um, you talked about, kind of, different, different frameworks or buckets of content, and I think subconsciously or otherwise, I already sort of think about

[Charlie Deist] 10:19:45
Actually, I don't know that I necessarily had this this bucket so much top of mind. I had in mind, like, when we do the newsletter, it's always Thought Trend Tool, so that's kind of like… you know, tools sort of like how-to guides. Sometimes it's a how-to, sometimes it's more of just like a, hey, here's a new AI math tutor you can try out.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:05
Um, the psychology stuff, a lot of times, these fit the trends, where it's like, okay, why did everybody… why did… kids suddenly get depressed in 2012. And actually, I'm thinking about this right now. This would be a great short-form video. If I could execute on it with the visuals and a good script.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:22
There's this book, uh, like, a huge bestseller, came out last year, called The Anxious Generation by a social psychologist, Jonathan Haidt, and he's talking about, um, you know, this huge explosion in depression and anxiety among teens.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:36
Kind of tracing it to social media and smartphones. And 2012 is when the line really starts to spike for depression and anxiety. And that was the same year that the smartphone companies introduced the front-facing camera.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:49
So that's why we get kind of, like, selfie culture and the, uh, all that. I feel like we could… I could… He makes that connection. Um, but I feel like I could probably, you know, do a shout-out, like, do a, you know, call that out from the book.

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:52
Yeah, that's… that's smart. Does he make that connection?

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:57
Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:03
Um, and just, like, spin that off in some interesting direction with some visuals.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:10
Um… the emotional content, I kind of think of that, like, we do a lot of just sort of validating parents, um, but I think that it is broader than this, and, like, that hair braiding video talking about why I homeschool, you know, so my 9-year-old doesn't have to see porn, so blah blah blah blah blah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:27
Um, that… like, that stuff, I think… is… but all of these could be well-suited to… that style of video where it's mostly about the text on the screen.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:39
Sort of supported by the… caption, um… And then just the video is playing a little bit of a backup role, at least this is how I'm thinking of it.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:49
The video's just creating a little bit of, like, backup intrigue, something, you know, either eye candy, something relatable, um, the kind of cottagecore Pinterest.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:58
Uh, visuals, but then, like. The actual text content is doing the heavy lifting to keep people there.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:07
Yeah, no, that's exactly how I would go after it, too. And, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:13
There… you can think of these in both like, content buckets, but also stylistic buckets. So, like, theoretically, your podcast clips could satisfy almost any of these, right?

[Charlie Deist] 10:22:25
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:26
But that's a style. And then the text with B-roll That's another style that doesn't need to be just emotional content.

[Charlie Deist] 10:22:36
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:36
It could also be the science-psychology stuff, right? Like… You could cut, let's say.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:42
A voiceover about the science of… and I think I showed… one of those was an example, right? That someone was talking about like, adolescent boys needing a certain thing, but he was cut against cottagecore video. And… I think that's a way of looking at it, that

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:00
While a podcast clip could probably cover any of these content types.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:04
You can think of podcasts as a style. And then your cottagecore text with B-roll, that's a style.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:12
That could theoretically handle any of these. And then UGC… UGC is a style.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:15
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:18
But that style could be applied to emotional content, science and psychology, how to guides, whatever.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:23
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:24
That it's not so black and white, that, like, if it's UGC, it's how-to all day, because what else, right?

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:30
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:30
And if it's podcast, it's gotta be science and psychology. No, it's like, I think there's a style, and then there's the kind of the bucket.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:36
Yeah, one of our best performing meta ads… we had it first as a video format, where it was, like, it was a… kind of Instagram comment of somebody saying, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:48
Just learned that, you know, in Finland, they go to school for fewer hours, but they have higher test scores, something like that. And then there's a voiceover that comes in and says, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:55
Uh-huh.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:58
You know, oh, girl, I was just reading about that same thing, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:02
Blah blah blah, and then it was an ad for the OpenNet Daily, like, heard this in the Openet Daily, I don't know. Uh, and then we… we kind of repurposed that same message in the form of a mock Reddit post. Same idea, same core message.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:16
That in both of those formats, did really well. I thought that was interesting, and it makes me kind of… I'm on the lookout for more of these kind of trends, you know, science and psychology.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:20
That is interesting. Well, I'm wondering if you could… Can you deploy that to organic social in any style you want? Like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:32
If that message has been confirmed to work, I would just quadruple down. The way that, like, on Velvet Alfredo.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:35
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:39
It's the same gag, right? Like, I don't go searching for new gags often. And when I do, I'm still finding them, right?

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:43
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:46
My gag is, hey, can I take your photo? And it's… that's it. Every time, every day in the entire account's built off that. So, it's not like you need to have 17 really great ideas. If you have one really good one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:49
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:58
Then it's like, alright, so how can I… how far can I twist this idea?

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:02
Can I turn that into a video? Can I have… podcast hosts say that to each other.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:09
Cool. Can I do animated text? Can I make a version? But, like, if you've got a message that resonates, it'd be interesting to push the boundaries as to why it resonates.

[Charlie Deist] 10:25:19
Yeah, for sure. For sure. Um… And something that I'm a little bit embarrassed to even show for feedback, but I think that means that I should probably do it, rather than just sit on it. This was something… this was kind of a format slash aesthetic and workflow that I was playing with, with the new Google VO

[Charlie Deist] 10:25:40
Video generator, and I couldn't… actually, I couldn't find my login for it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:42
Oh, yeah. God, you're so deep on this stuff, dude. You're so… I haven't even touched this yet.

[Charlie Deist] 10:25:48
It… it's free. That's one thing. It's kind of crazy. Actually, maybe I did have to create, like, a trial account for the pro thing to get it, but then… Um, I haven't hit any kind of caps on it, and this video I actually didn't love, because this video doesn't look at all

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:01
Like user-generated. And if you really zoom in on it, you start to see the, like, very strong AI tells, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:09
You know, with the teacher's drawing on the chalkboard is… Yeah, like, I don't think that is a real, uh, meaningful equation, but I just put this.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:10
Oh, yeah, oh, that's funny. The math is not right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:19
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:19
I mean, this is kind of, like. Previously, I would have had… I would have done this as a… as an image post.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:26
You know, just put this text on, like, a textured piece of paper and post it on Instagram.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:26
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:31
But I do notice that, you know, our reels get more engagement than our static images, so something like this.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:37
Just like a kind of cute little aphorism or something like this.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:41
Um, and, you know, maybe set it to some trending music.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:44
Uh, it's 8 seconds long, um… This one, I was kind of going for, like, a little bit of that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:51
Aesthetic of the, um… you know those fridge magnets? They're kind of, like, snarky, irreverent, you know, like… I haven't had my coffee yet, so I'm gonna bite your head off with the smiling housewife.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:55
Sure, yep. Yes. Yes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:00
Yeah. Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:02
Um, kind of, kind of that vibe, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:06
I would say, um, that's a great idea. I think trending audio is exactly where you should try this.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:14
Um, something that I have in my head that I'm going to experiment with this weekend is making more of my videos not in Adobe Premiere, but doing it in Instagram edits.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:21
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:22
Because, um, I think classically, these platforms super serve their newest features, and so there is connective tissue between edits and Instagram, so it knows when you've used one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:28
Right. I see, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:33
And so, if you build this in edits and deploy it to Instagram via the edits.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:39
App, I'm wondering if that throws extra signal weight to Instagram, and it's like, oh, we're gonna… because we wanna… it's… every time you do that, it's an advertisement for edits.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:49
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:49
And it's like, okay. So, um, edits… edits would also be a great place. You're already kind of familiar with these next-gen tools, so, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:57
Mm-hmm. Is that a desktop or a phone app?

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:57
You're gonna be fine in edits, um, but it also… it's a phone app. Um, it's… it's a… if you have a Mac, you can… you can use it on, I'm pretty sure, you can use… because… Because I can… yeah, exactly.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:03
Okay, gotta do them fun.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:09
Oh, yeah. Well, now there's this, like, screen mirroring thing, so maybe I can do… oh, cool, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:13
Yep, exactly. I… so I… yeah, I use that, so try that out. But that's where you can get the trending audio, is my point.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:18
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:18
So, like, I would try that out and see. And, um… that would probably be a… good expo… regardless what you're discussing, there's a good experiment, whether it's 8 seconds, whether you can make it longer, or if that's the right AI video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:34
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:34
But I think you're in the right direction of, like, yeah, that fridge magnet stuff, I think would be… would work really well. I would bet it would play, like, Gangbusters on Facebook, too.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:42
Oh, yeah, yeah. Video or image, do you think, there?

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:45
Well, I think… I think Facebook's definitely more, um… it accepts photos in a better way than Instagram.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:52
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:52
But I think both. I mean, I think… you know, people are… they're much more frivolous with their viewing patterns on Facebook, and it is a bit more polarizing.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:01
Yeah. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:02
Um, it's… it's less community-focused and more crazy So I think, like, fridge magnet stuff is exactly where you'd expect to see it, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:10
Okay, nice. Um, well, I might… I'll play around and try to get a few more of those designed and get your feedback next week.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:18
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:19
Um, do you… would it be easier for you in any way to set, like, a recurring time earlier in the week, or… I'm happy to… I can go either way. My pretty static, so I can… I can slot it in at last minute, or…

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:33
If you'd like to, I'm totally down. I'm also happy to be flexible. It's up to you. It's whatever works for you, really. My… Especially the times… I use the morning to do a lot of my editing So, the fact that you're on Pacific time has worked out really well, because by the time you're ready to have a chat.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:45
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:51
It's like, well, mom, done. Like, my afternoons… I generally don't edit in anyway, so… Um, it has worked out really well for me, so I'm really flexible in between noon Eastern time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:54
Nice. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:03
And, uh, about 4.30 Eastern Time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:06
Okay. Okay, maybe I'll… maybe I'll toss out, uh, time that we could do… have our kind of set recurring meeting, that would be awesome.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:13
Okay, yeah, yeah. And we could do a recurring Friday one, too. It's however you want to rock and roll, man.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:16
Um, and then…

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:21
Alright, good deal. Yeah, that, I think, could work well for me. I like having a little bit of… That routine.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:27
Sure. Yeah, absolutely. I'm looking at your… the episode you just uploaded here on YouTube, the long-form podcast one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:35
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:36
Um, and… I think my instinct would be to address that thumbnail, and just see what you… see what you can do.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:41
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:43
Um, because I would have thought it would have worked. Um, because the thumbnail it's the version I would have made.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:46
I did… I did 3 variations. There's another one that says, you'll never do that after school, and then another one that says your kid's C-plus is fine.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:52
Um…

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:01
But if we want to think even a little bit further outside the box.

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:04
Um, it could be… it doesn't have to be a direct quote from him. I'm kind of now thinking about, again, that, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:10
Um, uh, that, that complementarity that you engineered into the one with the, like, what could we do? How top 1% parents prep their kids.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:15
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:20
Did you… when you said you made… a few, are you ABC testing them in YouTube, or did you only publish one?

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:25
That's what I'm doing in YouTube, yeah. And it hasn't given any results yet. It says not enough information. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:27
You're… okay. So… Yeah, it takes… it takes weeks.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:32
Usually takes weeks. Um… the… Yeah, they're all quotes.

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:40
They're all quotes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:41
Top 1% parents prompt their kids I… the thing about the kids C plus is fine is almost too negative to my ears. Like, it's… it's almost Well, that's not what I'm shooting for. What I'm shooting for is something even higher, like, um…

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:52
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:09
I'm trying to remember what that first… I'm gonna click… one sec here.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:26
Oh, I'm so sick of hearing this. That's… that was the line. Um Something that… that…

[Charlie Deist] 10:32:29
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:40
Something that, like, piques your curiosity. I'm so sick of hearing this And… it's like, oh, I want to hear what the 1%ers do.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:54
Like, there's something… there's something there of, like. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:05
Yeah…

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:13
Um…

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:17
The world pays for edges. Your kid will hate you.

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:24
No. The career killer, uh, let them fail.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:25
Um…

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:33
I would almost… play to the psychology in the other direction of there's something that you're doing that you always just assume you have to do.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:44
Like, and not that you'd make fun of public school, but, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:49
Public schools ruining them. That's not the right one, but, like, something…

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:52
No, I… well, and there's one that is a direct quote. Nobody cares about your degree, or nobody cares where you went to school, something like that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:03
Well, no, it's good, it's good. I just, I wonder, I'm not sure… that's a good quote, it's whether or not it… um, fits with how the top 1% parents prep their kids.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:04
No. Um…

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:15
Because the prep implies… I'm about to get some, like, legitimate tips and tricks.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:22
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:24
And I guess I'm already operating around the assumption of, like, mo… like, normal schooling.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:30
Right? So, what am I about to hear? Right? There… there is a tutor… is it tutoring? Is it, you know, what's going on?

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:33
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:38
So you kind of want to play into that psychology, or against it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:44
Um… is where my instinct is at that time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:48
Yeah. Um…

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:51
Like, okay, so, like, for instance, if it was… this one trick worked.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:57
You know, like, um… something… something I was like, oh shit, I want… like, what is the answer to how top 1% parents prep their kids? And then tease that answer.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:01
Right.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:08
Right, right, right. Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:15
Works every time. Right like that? Like, that would be… that would be the kind of thing, like, oh shit, if the promise of this video is it will work every time if I follow the advice that the 1%.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:16
Right, right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:30
Do to prep their children, right? Like, that's the promise of the video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:33
Yeah, yeah. Even if it's… even if it's not, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:34
Um. Like, with…

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:38
Really borne out in the content itself, as long as it's sort of close enough.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:43
It has… yeah, I mean, you have to be in the universe, right? Like, my… so my video… I spent 6 months with Ray-Ban MetaSmart glasses.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:50
Um, they're… they… they've got one serious problem. And in that video, I discussed the fact that they only… they'd only shoot portrait. They don't shoot 16x9.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:01
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:01
And the next version has to shoot 16x9 so that you can wear them for social media videos and for long-form YouTube videos.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:08
But I express my absolute love for these things. So it's… so it's like, yeah, alright, it wasn't like a deal-breaker, but it was very much, like, that's the one feature that needs to be addressed.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:11
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:19
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:19
And I assume over, you know, your 38 minutes, you're going to talk about, you know, what these guys should do. And when you come out the other end, you're like, yeah, I heard a bunch of device.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:28
Right, I mean… Yeah, could it be something like, rich kids learn this, or, uh, you know, try…

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:36
That's great, that's… yeah, that's great. Um, it's kind of the same thing.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:41
But that might not be bad, that might not be bad.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:41
Right, right. Or the one thing that works, that do this instead? I don't know.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:49
Yeah. I think the more specific, the better. Do this instead. I've tried those, and I see those.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:52
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:56
But it tends not to work for me. The more specific I can be.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:59
Okay. Well, let's toss, uh… Rich kids learn this into the mix and see… see if that… if we get data in two weeks.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:07
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:15
The other thing that you might want to consider I… text might be better on the left-hand side of the image.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:23
Because if you… if you mouse over, you see some of the UI pops up on the right-hand side of the image.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:23
Okay.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:28
Oh, interesting.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:29
And so you can block some of the text.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:34
And so I would consider putting the text on the left-hand side. Similar to your STEM one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:34
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:40
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:40
Have we been teaching STEM completely? That, like, there's no UI there that is really overlapping

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:49
And does it matter, like, top or bottom?

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:53
Um… I don't think… yeah, I don't think… I don't think top or bottom matters. It's really just the… the UI on the right-hand side. There's something in the far bottom corner that's the time the amount… the duration. And then there is disappearing UI for the watch later and the playlist queue nonsense.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:55
In this case, toward the top, top left, like, there's more space above his shoulder.

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:03
Okay. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:15
So…

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:15
Yeah, no, just looking at it, it looks… it looks much… and just also with the way his head is slightly tilted to one side, there's a little more space there for the… the words.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:23
Yeah. Um… Yeah, I would try that, but I think overall.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:33
It isn't about obsessing over one video, it's trying to build up the muscle of what am I trying… what am I… what am I… like, working towards, and that is click-through rate. Click-through rate is the thing that's where you'll win. That…

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:44
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:47
That the advice that I wish I could take for myself, but I just get so excited making the videos, but if… You need the title and the thumbnail before you even start. Like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:58
Best case, like, just build a series of titles and thumbnails, and you're a YouTuber.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:03
The video is almost inconsequential. Like, it's the thumbnail and the title that, like, get the click.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:09
And then make a video, and we see varying qualities of video, despite the fact that so much of it is Hollywood grade, you still see like, not awesome videos in there. So… it's like, you know, make an incredible thumbnail and title, and you could win.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:18
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:25
Okay, yeah. No, I got that, and it's very helpful to go over it in this specific Okay, okay. My, uh, my kids informed me that there's a yucky bug in the… in the other room

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:27
On YouTube, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:40
Alright, um… But yeah, doing it in the specific gives me that muscle memory, and then… and I'll… carry that over into the long game.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:51
Yeah, and it's… click-through rate's the one thing I would obsess over first.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:55
Okay, nice. I've never heard that before, but it makes total sense now, in hindsight.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:01
Rock and roll. And, you know, I could… I could talk to Europe about this, because I think about this every minute of every day these days.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:07
That there's… there's two philosophies to win on YouTube. Long form. There is the, I'm gonna get suggested to people, like, here are videos on your homepage.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:19
You… you like sci-fi TV shows, you like cooking, and here's the stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:19
Uh…

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:24
And it has all the SEO stuff you'd expect. Like, um… like, words in the title, words in the description, that whole game.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:28
Not bad, hold on.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:33
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:33
But then there's… then there is the sidebar stuff. And the sidebar game is slightly different, of, like, um… It's more of this psychology, of, like, title.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:48
Thumbnail. Oh, shit, what's that? Like, that's a slightly different game. Maybe this is, like, level 2 stuff, but this is… it's a slightly different game than, let me just get served to an audience on their homepage that really wants

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:03
Really wants it. As opposed to, how many times do you fall into rabbit holes based on your suggested stuff on the side?

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:09
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:09
Where it's like, oh, I didn't… I wouldn't even have guessed Right? But, like, but I'm in the universe of this, and so, like, this is something that I'm interested in.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:17
Um, that… that dual strategy, I think, is something that we can get into a little bit more, too.

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:22
Yeah. No, it is funny how you can get pigeonholed by the algorithm after a certain point, like, Facebook used to know that I really liked watching epic boat crashes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:28
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:33
Now it knows that I really like chainsaw reviews and, like, lumberjack videos Which perfectly parallels my move from the Bay Area, where I was doing sailing and boating stuff, to now where I'm out here chopping down trees.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:38
Yes, yes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:47
Very cool. Very cool. Yeah, yeah. I think that…

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:48
How does it know? Facebook, honestly, the only reason I go to Facebook these days is, well, Marketplace. I like the ads that Facebook serves me up. It knows me so well that it, like, it knows the products that I actually want.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:57
Oh, interesting.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:02
Um, and then sometimes those reels are just a… entertaining way to pass 5 minutes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:42:09
Yeah, Instagram is that way for me. Like, Instagram has me on lock. Like, it's sending me every preset for photo coloring, every lens, every little… piece of nonsense. Um, it's really… it's wild.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:18
Yeah. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:42:23
What else you got?

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:25
Um, that… that was… Pretty much, I mean, I could… I could also… go on… like, there's… I had one idea, uh, for something that I think could be somewhat lower activation energy, because it doesn't require me to be on screen for the duration of the video, but there's sort of the style where, like, maybe you've got someone, like, pointing to the title in the first frame, where it's…

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:46
You know, we do a lot of, like… yeah, in the newsletter, the tool and curriculum reviews are, like, new tools and things like that are pretty popular. Those get a lot of link clicks.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:56
Um, and I can imagine doing Um, kind of like, you know, here are the top 10, you know, top 10 AI math tools, or top 5 AI math tools, or something like that, and then for the footage, I mean, one thought that's kind of boring would just be, like, screen share footage, but I think

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:13
Where I've seen people take, like, cell phone footage of, you know, the… their actual computer screen. That just makes it a little bit more real and tactile.

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:23
Um, and that's… I can imagine, you know, just as an experiment, as kind of a one-off experiment.

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:27
Yeah, I mean, absolutely. With your voiceover, with your voiceover, it could even be AI voiceover, yeah. Um… That sounds great. I mean, I think that's where, like, practical tips and tricks are really helpful if you're in the market for that stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:28
See if that for… that… Yeah, yeah, right. My voice over AI voiceover…

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:43
So, if you are able to provide those tips and tricks, you can… that's… That's a killer, all on its own.

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:44
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:51
Um, like, there are endless… like, I don't know, self-taught chefs just have like, they share all their tips and tricks, and their content is not elaborate in any way, whether it's short form or long form, and they win forever.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:05
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:05
And it's like, exactly. Because if you want it, you got it. It's how recipe videos work.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:11
Recipe videos are essentially how-tos. And, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:15
Do that and you win. And if you… I'm sure there are… aesthetic ways of doing that. Like, there's something about recipe videos that, like, now, after, you know, 30-odd years.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:27
After Emeril Lagasse on the Food Network. Even home chefs can make their stuff look really nice in a standard kitchen.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:33
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:33
You could probably deploy those aesthetic techniques to anything. Right? Like, how do you make on-screen imagery look fantastic and be very, very watchable. That's probably solvable.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:47
Yeah, yeah, this is a little bit off… off the… reservation, but, um, I discovered a… Twitter account yesterday that I was a little bit hooked by.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:57
Kiel James Patrick, who's like this… he has a store, a classic New England clothing.

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:03
He's got 1.3 million followers on Instagram. I found him through Twitter, but he's just, like, this kind of… smug, unapologetically Anglo-Saxon wasp.

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:13
New England, and he's got, you know, two photogenic golden retrievers, and this beautiful storefront, and he just takes these picture-perfect videos around New England, kind of being, like, a little bit like, like, like shoving it in your face.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:22
Uh-huh.

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:25
But there's something very likable about it. And, uh, it was getting me a little bit of inspiration for, uh, sort of… my own, you know, if I could do this with the sort of homesteading lifestyle, obviously there's a zillion accounts like that, but mostly women kind of doing their aesthetic

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:41
Uh, you know, trad wife thing, but…

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:41
Yeah, I… I… I wouldn't… I mean, I always think there's room for another person, because it's like, if you enjoy watching it as a viewer, to find somebody else, like, that's just another one to throw in the fire for you.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:53
Right? Like, oh, great! I like this person. There's another one? I love him too.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:57
And, um, I would… I would go deep in that if I were you. The… there was this guy, I think his name's Sad Pappy, but he was a… he's a chef, but he's, like, all tatted up.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:10
Very alternative, but knows as shit. And his style is so, like, slow and slack and cool, that I was like, man, I wonder if you can do camera stuff in his style.

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:13
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:24
Like, because

June 10 (1)

meeting_saved_closed_caption

[Andrew Muto] 12:12:48
Got a summary from the actual guy who understands this. And the deeper you dig into the AI universe, a lot of them will tell you, like, this is really… We’re flying by the seat of their pants, and we don’t really understand a lot of this, or how it scales, because if we did.

[Charlie Deist] 12:12:50
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:13:01
We’d be able to build it better, faster. And so, I don’t know how much of this… I’m starting to get some more doubt that, like, AI… what it’s doing right now, it’s very good at, but the idea that it could even get to the level of being a sophisticated agent for you, of understanding the context of, like, I want to go to… I want a vacation to Venice, and it, to not fuck up that you want to go to Venice, California, not Venice, Italy, like, I’m…

[Charlie Deist] 12:13:03
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 12:13:12
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:13:27
I’m… I’m increasingly… Uh… skeptical, I guess, that AI is going… is going in that direction. I might be wrong, but just feels like… I haven’t seen anything that blows my mind that I can’t attribute to, like, statistical… like, it is…

[Charlie Deist] 12:13:33
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:13:45
It is, um, you know, statistics in action is fundamentally what it’s doing, right? If you index every written word in human history, you could put together an incredible chapter of a book.

[Andrew Muto] 12:13:58
But that’s… that’s like a statistics thing, as opposed to a reasoning and logic, and like, what am I doing? And… Um, it seems like it won’t be able to do some of the things we want it to do, like rewrite itself.

[Andrew Muto] 12:14:10
In, um… that isn’t… like, the whole thousand monkeys typing a thousand hours, and eventually you get a script, it’s almost like that, where it’s like, yeah, no, the compute is so good.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:15
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:14:20
That, like, you can throw a thousand monkeys at it, and in 10 seconds, you’ll get back the version that makes sense.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:26
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:14:27
Um, as opposed to… training a… a… process that can learn and iterate.

[Andrew Muto] 12:14:34
I don’t know. Um… It’s interesting times, though, that’s for sure.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:39
Yeah, I mean, this is top of mind for me, and partly because today I… maybe I’m a little bit behind the eight ball, or… day late and a dollar short on some of the things that I said I wanted to talk about today.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:53
I have one concept for an alternative. Short that relies more on, you know.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:59
Material that I can find from places, and that wouldn’t be a very heavy lift.

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:02
That, I don’t know how much time it will actually take to look at that. Um, I had some thoughts that maybe we could… spend a little bit more time thinking about a sort of a… the formula behind YouTube titles and thumbnails with the thinking… at one point, I had planned to go through

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:19
Sort of all the previous podcasts, um, just because it feels like if I batch process now, and I do take the 30 episodes that we’ve put out, or 50, I don’t know how many we’ve done.

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:30
Um, like, I could potentially… Given that you’re saying, you know, YouTube has this kind of long tail, um… Maybe… maybe start to get more clicks on those old videos.

[Andrew Muto] 12:15:36
Yeah, I think they’re both valuable in context of, like, building awareness immediately.

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:40
Um, as lower-hanging fruit than And simultaneously optimizing going forward.

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:48
Um, but I don’t know, again, I don’t know what the relative ROI is going to be on that versus continuing to try to find the real formats that are replicable and that can drive growth across all the short-form video platforms.

[Charlie Deist] 12:16:02
So, sort of, long-form YouTube titles versus continuing to find the formats on short form.

[Charlie Deist] 12:16:08
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 12:16:14
Right? Like, um… I think… I mean, I see in my metrics that, like, and I just had a call with another creator, um, late last week, where Um, he does something very similar to what I do. His name’s Justin Vinema, and he’s like, he does what I do on the street, but he does it with

[Andrew Muto] 12:16:30
Dogs. And he’s 3 times bigger than me. And, um, I got on a call with him, and I was just chatting him up, like, you the transition into YouTube is very, very… long form is very tough for us, because, like, how the fuck do you extend what we do into YouTube long form?

[Charlie Deist] 12:16:31
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:16:45
And, um, he had tried a couple things with varying levels of success, and where he netted out was, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:16:52
He doesn’t want to do long and… it seems like a time suck to do long form and short form, and that he had success in short form, so why not just quadrupled out on short form? And everything that you want to get out of it.

[Charlie Deist] 12:17:00
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:04
Brand awareness, brand deals, money, blah blah blah. You can get all that out of short form.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:10
Um, because if you’re gonna have to be creative to solve long-form problems, you might as well get creative on short-form to solve short-form problems.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:17
And it’s like, man, that’s a compelling fucking case, because in my head, I’m thinking long form.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:23
Because I can get brand deals easier. But I have to solve for what works well on long form. If short form, if you just get more at-bats at short form.

[Charlie Deist] 12:17:32
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:33
You know, there’s… there’s an argument to be made that I’m kind of contemplating in my head of, like, maybe this long-form thing is a red herring, and then I… for me.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:41
And that if you… If all things being equal, short form can get you where you need to be. That if you just were publishing a ridiculous amount of stuff on short form constantly.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:52
One of those things would hit to the scale at which you get a lot of attention, and then you’re… it’s a snowball rolling downhill.

[Charlie Deist] 12:17:59
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:59
And long form is just exponentially more difficult. And the longer your long form is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:06
It’s even more difficult, because you gotta keep people watching, right? So, like, how do you make an incredible piece of long-form content, even if it is a podcast. You know, like, the barrier to entry there is… you know, pretty high, given that some of these podcasts these days are, like, really highly produced. It’s like, wow, okay.

[Charlie Deist] 12:18:23
Sure. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:25
Um, is somebody going to spend time on my video versus somebody else’s video?

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:29
So, um, I think about this a lot, and I think that, like, if one had to make a choice.

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:37
I guess, short form makes the most sense. That if one was like, listen, I gotta just concentrate on one of them.

[Charlie Deist] 12:18:40
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:44
Then short form is where I would triple down, because you just get… it takes less effort to publish, and you can publish more often.

[Charlie Deist] 12:18:54
Right, right. No, that makes a lot of sense, and kind of last week, we talked a little bit about some of these concepts that I had. I just haven’t been a document called High Octane YouTube Concepts.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:04
A lot of this was based on… And I think I mentioned this video that has one of the highest ratios of total views to average views on the channel, and it’s this video, how Archimedes almost broke math with circles.

[Andrew Muto] 12:19:18
That’s one of your videos? That’s one of your… Oh.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:18
Um, and… no, no, no, it’s, uh, let me see if I can… Pull it up, um, because there’s a lot in this that I feel like I would love to sort of master this style of video, if I could do it in a low-friction way. And this is an 8-minute video.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:34
But, um, I feel like you could probably do a lot of this stuff as short-form video.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:40
Uh, and I feel like it’s just… it’s… it’s sort of spot on the OpenEd open education brand in terms of… this… you can kind of tell already, like, you don’t even really have to watch the video. I’ll just play a couple of seconds.

[Andrew Muto] 12:19:47
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:54
I don’t even really remember, you know, and there’s some animation here that would be… above my pay grade, I would need to get a, uh… freelancer is somebody that could do these quickly, or find some other way Um, but the…

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:09
These sort of concepts like, um… just, you know, historical tidbits, curiosities, little things that That, uh… I don’t know, the… let’s see, what was this one? The lost language that children can learn, but adults can’t. Like, why is it that kids…

[Andrew Muto] 12:20:17
Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:26
Are so good at learning language, and adults aren’t. Just like, sort of meta… content about learning, like, an education.

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:35
Um, sort of thinking outside the box, but I haven’t actually… the fact that I haven’t actually, like, attempted to really execute on any of these, the closest that I came was that one, uh, it was like a 5-minute video of

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:49
Um, you know, your kid says, I hate school, what does that actually mean?

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:53
But, like, if I had done that one. Or if I redid that one as a… one minute short, um… maybe that’s, like, a better way to approach that.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:03
Well, it’s funny, so this is… this reminds me of something, um, I know we talked about Colin and Samira last week, but, um, I remember one of the most impactful videos I ever saw from them was this one with Cleo Abram, and she makes this show called Huge If True.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:08
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:16
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:17
And she makes… they’re, like, basically, like, science episodes, but she’ll… like, she’s like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:24
What happens inside of a black hole. And they’re incredibly… like… watchable. Like, these are… Whoa. Uh, hey Siri, stop.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:26
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:35
Sorry. So, they’re just very, very watchable. One of her things was that she makes… a lot of these episodes come from short form.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:45
Hmm. Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:45
That she throws a noodle at the wall, and if something sticks in short form, she’s like, oh shit, I should make that as a long form.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:52
Um, and she talks a little bit about that process in the course of this, like, 2-hour.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:52
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:57
Podcast. Um… confirm my speaking language, there we go. Um… So, you know, looking at your list there, I would say, man, especially, you know, it would take… you’d have to really suit up to do one of these. Let’s just be generous and be like, they’re sub-five minutes a pop.

[Charlie Deist] 12:22:13
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:14
But if you were like, hey, can you make a version of these that are, like, you know, 30 to 45 seconds?

[Charlie Deist] 12:22:18
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:19
And… and really try to hone in on what the drama of every video is. Like, what is the perfect question?

[Charlie Deist] 12:22:26
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:26
And… and how do you present that question, and how do you solve it? And then if you see any spikes in that, you’re like, well, this is one we’re going to go deeper in.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:34
And the cool part is, is that if any of these don’t work, you can kind of repackage it with a new VO.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:40
And a new kind of, like, opening question. And see, oh, can I get a hook on this instead?

[Charlie Deist] 12:22:45
Well, so here’s a thought I just had, and I was gonna ask you, because, like, I’ve been paring down the… open-ed, people that I follow, just so that I can actually get a finger on the pulse of, like, okay, what are other homeschool moms posting? So here’s posts, not reels. When I go to reels.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:59
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:02
It knows me, it knows that I’m a social media manager, and so everything is all about Instagram strategy. And what I’m… what I’m seeing in most of these is that they’re… very short, 5-second loops, and they reference the caption, and the meat of the content is in the caption.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:09
Uh-huh.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:20
Um, and there’s some good tips here. It’s overwhelming, and, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:20
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:26
Both exciting and despair-inducing at the same time, because… and this is why I go to you, because you can kind of cut through the BS and tell me, like, you don’t need to worry too much about that. But it’s like, oh, I should do this, and I should do this.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:34
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:39
Um, but I could kind of imagine, you know, you just put the hook And, like, a very simple visual, in the first 5 seconds, and then the storytelling is somehow in the caption.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:52
Yes, and that’s, like, a classic like, gimmick for Instagram Reels and TikTok.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:57
Um, mostly Instagram. And it… I think to a certain extent, it does work. I think that is, like, a thing that you can deploy. My wife has deployed that a handful of times on her account.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:58
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:07
But, um, it is a gimmick and less a long-term strategy. It’s, like, something to put in your… in your toolkit.

[Charlie Deist] 12:24:13
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:16
Of, like, hey, you know, I got something… And it may even come down to publishing. I’m just like, you know, I got… I need to publish a video today. I do not have any fucking time.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:25
And I’m gonna do this. I’m gonna… here’s what the video I plan to make.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:29
But I’m just gonna put the headline, and I’m gonna write everything in the description, and I’m gonna just film a video that goes like this, and I’m gonna be done. And then I’m going to brunch, you know? Like, that’s… and no harm, no foul, like, that stuff works. I would be… shocked if someone who does that gag consistently builds brand.

[Charlie Deist] 12:24:33
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:45
That you’re not really building brand, you’re building short-term gimmicks. And I also think that Instagram and these platforms are aware of these gimmicks.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:54
And they would love to snuff those gimmicks out, if they could. But yeah, because… because there’s a problem, too, like, what’s… so this, you know, what you showed was just, like, a 5-second loop.

[Charlie Deist] 12:24:58
Really. Interesting.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:05
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:05
What would stop somebody from going to one second, right? And one second is, you know, the algorithm is clever enough to be like, yo, a one-second video can’t… we can’t have that.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:14
And so now you’re just in this kind of Cold War, you know.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:14
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:19
What’s the… space race of… is it 1 second, 5 seconds? Where is the balance?

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:25
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:25
And so I think if they can detect that you are… gaming it. They’re not gonna punish you other than to just, like, this video’s not gonna be shown.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:32
Right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:33
Um, so I think it actually has to be deeply valuable.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:38
Um, and… and not just a gimmick, because then you’ll get… you know, you… the algo wants to beat those kind of bad actors. They really do want people to stay and watch videos and enjoy them.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:50
Interesting, okay, got it.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:51
Yeah, but it is not… I wouldn’t be against it. I mean, I would say, yeah, go for it. Add that as a thing that you do every… Yeah, you know, let’s say a couple times a month, maybe.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:57
I might try it. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:26:02
Um, and then really make sure that those, um. You know, the description is really chock full of real advice. What were some of the other things in there that kind of gave you… filled you with despair? Just the tips they were giving you?

[Charlie Deist] 12:26:09
Right, right, right. Um, just the overwhelm of, like, there’s so many… different, potentially contradictory things that I could try, uh, and, you know, how am I gonna find the… the time and effort to actually… how I feel knowing I have to film reels every day. Like, this is how, yeah, this is…

[Andrew Muto] 12:26:32
Yeah, well, I mean, that… so, man, I hear this stuff all the time. I was on a call with somebody yesterday that wanted me to, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:26:39
Talk at their… some… God, this is so harebrained. I don’t even know where to start. Some guy, this team of… creators or filmmakers have rented a space where they wanted to, like, sell studio time to other creators, but it hasn’t worked well. So I thought the best thing that they should do is create a non-profit and teach other people

[Charlie Deist] 12:26:53
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:26:57
How to be creators. And I was like, wait a second, that’s your pitch to me? Your pitch to me is that you haven’t been successful, so you had to teach other people how to be… and you want me to come in?

[Charlie Deist] 12:27:04
Right. Many such cases, many such cases.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:08
Yeah, and… and then they came in, and they were like, but every… we had a hard time finding students who wanted to join, because everybody just wants to be an influencer, and we think people should be building content for marketing brands, and I was like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:20
What the fuck? Influencers, that is the future, because that’s the only weapon against AI.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:26
That, like, so you have a face-to-face relationship with somebody that you look up to and trust, the Casey Neistat, right? If Casey dedicated himself to just making ads for Samsung.

[Charlie Deist] 12:27:31
Right, right, right. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:36
You wouldn’t fucking… what the fuck are we… so, anyway, um, but they were… they were lamenting how much content they had to make.

[Charlie Deist] 12:27:43
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:43
And I’m thinking, like, guys, this isn’t cost, this is benefit. This is… we’re so lucky!

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:48
Imagine if we didn’t have access to this platform, and all you’d have to do is, like, well, I guess I have to make content and buy ad time.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:56
Right? Nothing would change, what would change? You would just have to also pay for the ad time. So this person complaining here.

[Charlie Deist] 12:27:58
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:03
I mean, I’m so sorry that you’re getting free awareness. I mean, look at that free 6,400 likes.

[Charlie Deist] 12:28:10
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:11
Um, but on the other hand, maybe this is a super clever thing of, like, this is that polarization.

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:17
Right? Like, I’m about to… I’m about to get all red in the face because, um, she said something I disagree with.

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:23
And I’m 10 seconds away from hopping into her comments and being like, dummy. But that’s what she wants. Like, that’s the genius.

[Charlie Deist] 12:28:29
Right, right, right. Yeah, I mean, in my dream world, I guess there’s just, like, I could, you know, today I sent out an open-end daily, and I started to think, okay, how can I repurpose this for social media?

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:30
Um, and so, uh, good for her.

[Charlie Deist] 12:28:45
There’s some good things that could be a little quote graphic, just a little, like, text image.

[Charlie Deist] 12:28:50
You know, if I really wanted to get ambitious, I could turn that into a text over video reel, and then, like, there’s this… Great chart, I don’t know if I have it up right now, but it’s, like, the chart that shows

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:03
Um, how Gen Z is drinking less than every other generation, by a lot. And maybe this is just the fact that they’re still young or something, and they don’t have money to spend, but this, to me, is like, whoa, that’s a crazy stat. Like, the…

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:15
And actually, I found somebody, a young girl, that did a hot take on this, where she was like, the reason, you know, this is actually not good news, and then you have to watch the video to find out why. And she says.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:26
The reason is that they’re all spooked that somebody’s gonna record them doing something stupid.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:31
And that’s gonna haunt them for the rest of their life.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:34
And it kind of made me think back to, you know, college and, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:37
How would that have affected? Yeah, I think that potentially would… maybe that would have affected my… if everybody’s filming all the time.

[Andrew Muto] 12:29:43
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:43
Um, so my dream scenario would be, like, having some kind of a… having my content engine geared up to where I could take just this image.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:52
Write the script for the message. And, you know, get to the point where there’s a good video behind it.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:59
And I just don’t think that I’m the… I mean, I… I could be the face for it.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:04
Um, and in some sense, that probably still is going to be the lowest… the lowest friction.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:09
But I’m still thinking about… trying to think creatively about formats where I don’t have to be a talking head on screen, where I can just do voiceover, or, like, text over, you know, text over image.

[Andrew Muto] 12:30:22
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:22
Um, the video that I produced, which is… pretty lame, and I think it also suffers from this AI syndrome, and, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:30
Uncanny Valley artificiality. I bought, like, a… for $10 on Etsy.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:38
Kind of like a 10-pack of… AI-generated videos of just, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:43
Women doing the pointy thing. So, so, you know, here’s our, here’s our opening, like, this is a message that I think uh, resonates with people. The idea of getting your homeschooling done in 2 hours a day, or 3 hours a day.

[Andrew Muto] 12:30:45
Okay.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:58
Uh, maybe I’ve got too much going on here, because I also say 4 days a week.

[Charlie Deist] 12:31:02
But it’s like, alright, 5 tools we use to get homeschool done in 3 hours a day.

[Charlie Deist] 12:31:07
Um, you know, she’s pointing up. I seek naturalist app, that’s my, uh, pregnant wife, and… two of our kids, uh… Khan Academy, this is just, like, a recording of my screen.

[Charlie Deist] 12:31:21
Um, another one, like, Epic Library. Uh, and then I have a couple other, just sort of, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:31:28
Filming the screen to give it a little more, like. Texture. Um… But even…

[Andrew Muto] 12:31:31
Yeah. I don’t… I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. I think… I think this is an option. Going back to what you were saying before.

[Andrew Muto] 12:31:40
Is it feels like you’re on exactly the path I was when I was trying to think out velvet.

[Andrew Muto] 12:31:46
Where it’s like, I know what I’m trying to accomplish here. I got… I got things I want to talk about, and I need a production methodology.

[Andrew Muto] 12:31:53
And I was kind of really locked in on POV. And I had… I was struggling with the tech for months of, like, thinking about this. Every hour of every day, trying to figure out how can I get this… how can I wear this camera in a way that is, like, really baby simple.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:00
Hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:10
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:11
Um, and you’re in that… it feels like you’re on that same path of, like, you have these ideas.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:16
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:17
That you want to deploy. And you’re… now you’re getting very familiar with the structure in which they need to be deployed, and the real question is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:25
How do I do this consistently? In a way that is pretty frictionless for me. And given your skill sets. And it’s like, okay, cool. And this is… I think this is fun work.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:31
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:36
But it is torturous work in that it’s like an artist trying to find their, you know, their yellow pigment.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:44
You know, it’s like, God, I can’t… I know what I’m looking for, and to me, that’s the artist’s struggle.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:44
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:50
And you kind of have to just keep hunting. And I could even flashback and say my whole career has been leading up to me trying to find velvet.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:59
So I’m not… it’s not like a 3-month process, theoretically. It could be, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:03
I’m still trying to find that thing. Like, I know what I want to do.

[Charlie Deist] 12:33:05
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:08
And I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t ever walk away from that. It’s just a matter of, like, what is that thing?

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:14
And I would challenge your preconceived notions as to what you think you’re capable of. Like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:20
George Lucas famously had this argument with his wife, where he was making this very insular, hard-to-understand movies in the early 60s.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:28
And his… and his wife was like, George, I don’t know why you keep making these movies that nobody likes.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:33
Um, why don’t you make something the audience can enjoy? And he was like, well, it’s not a big deal to make a movie that everybody loves, it’s just take a kitten and wring its neck. And it’s like, fine, I’ll show you. And he made American graffiti.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:44
And then… and he’s like… and he says, this is easy, and everybody fucking loved it.

[Charlie Deist] 12:33:44
Oh, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:49
And then he made Star Wars, and he’s like, I just… I just turned my logic on its head.

[Charlie Deist] 12:33:53
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:53
Of, instead of swimming against the current. I just turned around and swam with it, and it turned out it was really easy.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:01
And it’s… it’s that thinking, too, where, like, maybe you don’t want to be on camera, not saying that you have to be, but, like, any… any areas where, like, well, I’ve put some guardrails up, I would at least take some time on a walk or, you know, in the shower, just consider the guardrails and say, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:34:01
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:16
Kent, should I try that? Should I do it? Whatever. Um, so I would say that. But… What you’re going on here is exactly that journey, like, how do you… what is the content?

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:26
The AI stuff, I don’t think this is bad. I think there’s a gimmick to this very specific layout that you’re kind of on this longer than you should be. I think that you need to be on this longer, right? Because you need to give them time of, like, alright, so what is it?

[Charlie Deist] 12:34:34
Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:39
Right? And you’re kind of waiting for it to start, and once you’re in the video deep enough.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:45
The algo thinks, oh, they must really enjoy this. The hook must have been so good, they’re still watching.

[Charlie Deist] 12:34:50
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:50
Right? If you do it really quickly and get into it, you’re like, oh shit, I couldn’t even really understand what they were saying in the beginning, and I haven’t built up that anticipation.

[Charlie Deist] 12:34:59
So you’re saying this opening should be shorter or longer? Longer, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:00
Um. Longer, longer, longer.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:04
Um, like, give somebody time to read it, and really, like, okay, I’m down. If you… because if you’re in, you’re in. If you’re in, you’re gonna watch the whole damn thing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:08
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:13
Right, right. Yeah, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:17
Um, and then I think the technique of showing that, I mean.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:21
If you really want to be helpful, I would try to make it as clear as possible, you know, Khan Academy, whether it’s a logo or whatever. You know, I’m assuming you’re gonna put OpenEd in there somewhere?

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:27
Right, right. Um, I wasn’t planning on it, actually, but now that you mention it, it, like, as number 3 or something like that.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:34
Okay. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I would… I would try to do… I mean, that’s… you know, I think everybody who has a newsletter It is fundamentally an excuse to talk about your thing. I think that’s great, right? I think, like, if…

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:38
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:48
Yeah, no, I mean, and then it also becomes potential ad creative if it… If it works.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:52
Yeah, exactly. Um… So, I mean, I think these kind of techniques are, like, um… go back, you had, you had, like, a list of things you wanted to talk about. You just, um… was it a Google Doc?

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:02
My list was… I mean, I emailed you a couple things. It was, like, YouTube thumbnails and thumbnail title combination, that kind of complementarity.

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:10
Seeing if we could… oh. Okay, right, right, right. Um… That was…

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:11
No, no, you just had a list of subjects.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:17
Well, you also described that, the fading bomb thing there, like, so if you had a great idea, if you go back to that infographic that had the, um, the drinking, if you had a great idea, like, hey, I want to turn this into a video.

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:23
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:28
Exactly. I mean, that’s… you’d be super well positioned to do that, and it’s just like, what is the structure?

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:34
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:34
Of the production methodology that lets me do this. And, like, even listing out what those options could be, and going on a hunt.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:43
On social media. Of, like, what, what… like, and you, you don’t even need to, like, search for this, just scroll, and you’ll see a bunch of ones pop up. You saw the one where they’re going like this, or going like this, right?

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:53
But there’s plenty of others, and it’s like, start to… start to, like, save a folder worth of, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:53
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:59
These are production styles. And which ones make the most sense?

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:01
Yeah, I’m trying to… No, totally. That reminds me, um… I have a young friend, young Gen Z friend that shared this video with me. I don’t know, am I sharing sound right now?

[Andrew Muto] 12:37:15
Uh, I don’t think so, I didn’t hear anything, no.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:16
Okay, because this video, I’m pretty amazed by the… Like, this should have way more than 10,000 views, based on how much… how good this video is. But, I mean, the claim here, every content strategy explained in 60 minutes, 16 minutes.

[Andrew Muto] 12:37:30
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:30
Um, it’s maybe slightly overselling, but my friend shared this video with Specifically, he directed me to a timestamp, 2.31.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:39
Strategies. The key women of reach, if you can get controversial, and you send the information or reveal. So this is typically going to be some kind of exciting music, jumping between different years or different stages of your life, maybe when you’re really skinny previously, and you suddenly switch to commercial It’s definitely worth testing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:40
Um, let’s see… Okay, here we go.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:52
Uh, this one I can’t really see using it. I’m not sure why he’s saying… suggesting this one.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:56
But, um… I mean, I can see for this one, like, I can kind of imagine Doing, you know, kind of like a fast pace, where I just… try to get into, um… not stream of consciousness mode, because I’d want to have a script, but like…

[Charlie Deist] 12:38:13
Get into my theater kid mode, and just do, like, a pretty simple, not overactive, but just, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:38:18
Read my script, maybe, you know, point at one part of the graph or something, and just have this as the background.

[Charlie Deist] 12:38:25
I could maybe, you know, if I find the study, I could find one highlight in the study where it’s just… the only assets are My talking head with a green screen filter applied to it, and then a handful of still screenshots.

[Andrew Muto] 12:38:37
I mean, that sounds great to me. I mean, have you ever seen that guy that does the thing where he’s, like, shooting in a mirror, he’s a black guy, and he’s like, he’ll say one line, he’s like, come here, and then the camera zooms in at every little bit.

[Andrew Muto] 12:38:48
And then he’ll talk about anything. It might be… he’s like, everybody’s been looking for that, or have you been looking for that, uh, blah blah blah recipe? Come here, I found it for you. And then he goes… and then he talks.

[Andrew Muto] 12:38:58
And it’s just that hook. He found that one hook. And then I saw this other guy recently who has been explaining internet things to his wife. And so it’s always him in the kitchen, on the, you know, the island, and he’s got the phone, and he’s like, alright, honey, listen, now I gotta tell you about X.

[Andrew Muto] 12:39:16
And it goes, and it goes… and he’s just found the hook.

[Charlie Deist] 12:39:16
Right, right. Yep, yep.

[Andrew Muto] 12:39:19
And in all cases. They’re very easy. In all cases, it doesn’t seem like anybody needs to suit up for a big thing at all, which I think is… the recipe for success, right? That, like, if you have to say, okay, I gotta get the teleprompter up, and I gotta write, there’s a 2-hour time for me to write the script, and blah… it’s like, these people show… I think they just have an idea that you got this, and you’re like, I’m gonna go, I’m gonna riff, and I’m gonna figure it out. I did happen to watch your YouTube video where you were doing that on the open-end page, where you, you, um…

[Charlie Deist] 12:39:27
Right, right. No, it’s so true. Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 12:39:40
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:39:47
Why is it that so many tabs open right now. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 12:39:49
Oh, was it, like, a Duolingo? Okay, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:39:52
Yes, the owl one, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And it’s like, dude, you’re… you know, you’re really good, right? Like, that’s… that would be… a lot of people would be hard-pressed to have been that clever, and, like, that was… you were well-spoken, it made sense.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:10
Um, and I think… Um, I saw a YouTube version of it. If you’ve got a shorter version, I haven’t seen that. I saw, like, a 5-minute version.

[Charlie Deist] 12:40:14
Okay. Yeah, it was… it was maybe a couple minutes, and at one point, I tried to do one of these with Isaac, too.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:18
Um.

[Charlie Deist] 12:40:23
But it just, it wasn’t very good. It didn’t really make sense Um…

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:25
But I think you on camera. Is something too experiment with in short form.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:31
Um, even if it’s just you setting it up. Right? Even if it’s just you.

[Charlie Deist] 12:40:31
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:36
Um, like, whatever that hook is. And… it’s… non-trivial to find that hook.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:45
I will admit. But once you find that hook, you’re kind of on rails.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:50
And the struggle that you would have, and that I would say I have currently, is… you fall into this pipe of, like, so what happens if I don’t use that hook? Am I just… am I screwed? Like, I find every time I don’t do the… I think I’ve told you this before, every time I don’t use the, hey, you look incredible, can I take your photo? My video bombs. And it’s like, holy shit! Yeah, and bomb is, relative speaking, I’ll get, like, 20,000 views instead of 80,000.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:00
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:06
Really?

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:13
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:41:13
And it’s like, what the fuck? That sucks, though. Like, that somehow… I’m pigeonholed into this one really great hook, and that I am now forced to find a second once-in-a-lifetime hook, you know, like…

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:26
Right, right. No, I mean, have I showed you… have I showed you this that my other client before with… But you haven’t… you haven’t actually seen this, or…?

[Andrew Muto] 12:41:32
No, you’ve mentioned, you’ve mentioned, yeah. Let me see… I haven’t seen them, I haven’t seen him, no.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:37
Um, so let’s see, his pinned, like. I’m pretty sure in all three of his… He maybe has 4 reels with over a million views.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:46
Um, and I’m pretty sure that they all start with the same hook.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:48
I’m an 85-year-old clinical psychologist. People want tips. Uh, let’s see, I’m an 85-year-old clinical psychologist.

[Andrew Muto] 12:41:55
Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:57
I want… this one actually was a little bit different. I want to be an influencer. After 64 years in practice. Same basic thing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:05
Um, and he might have had… Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:06
And, you know, part of the hook is just the way he looks. You know, like, so very rarely see people that age.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:13
Participating in social media, so that’s super cool. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:14
Yeah. Yeah, this was the last one. I guess not… doesn’t have the same exact hook.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:20
But you can see how, like, nothing… Does he have a script? Do you know if he has a script?

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:25
No, nope, usually no. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:26
He just goes, right? Yeah. So, like, that’s the level of effort.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:29
The level of effort is really… showing up consistently And I’m assuming, taking the time to find this hook.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:30
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:39
I… maybe it’s possible that he got this out of the gate.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:42
And good for him. Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:43
No, no, it took a while, and it was just… it was this young social media manager that I brought on, and he found it in, like, the first 2 or 3 months.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:52
Or less, but it took some iteration, and then… Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:54
But that sounds exactly right. That sounds… I mean, that’s really what you’re looking for. And then.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:59
This is why the low effort works, where it’s like, I don’t have to hire an animator, I don’t have to hire a video editor, it’s just like, it’s just this. And, um, because the nightmare is, what happens if the hiring the editor version works. It’s like, oh, fuck, now I’m beholden.

[Charlie Deist] 12:43:05
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 12:43:12
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:14
To this editor, and, you know, like, the more complicated your process, the more you’re like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:20
I’m not really in charge of this, right? Like, it’s… I can imagine, in my scenario, if I didn’t rely on only me for velvet, boy oh boy, that would be frustrating Um, so, um… I think… I think you’re on the right path in terms of figuring out

[Charlie Deist] 12:43:27
Yeah. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:38
What you need. It’s just a matter of, like, you know, trying to… as fast as possible, usually.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:45
Deploy different versions of this that you feel good about, that are also… You know, because the other thing is, like, you can make videos, say, I don’t… God, I really hope this video doesn’t take off, I don’t really like this video. And then it’s a shame. That’s where I was with Fantastic Daily, where it’s like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:58
Oh, no, oh no, it’s the ghost stories that have taken off? Come on!

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:02
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:03
Um, and so it’s like, you want to make sure that, like, these are videos you really enjoy, because, um, you’re gonna be doing them a lot.

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:11
Yeah. Yeah, I guess the idea of having someone kind of reliable, who could take a concept and put the edit together. Like, I’m not totally opposed to that, if it really… you know, but I think… What I take away is…

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:30
I could try the, you know, try myself on a green screen. I might just, I might try that a little bit, a couple times, maybe with the Gen Z alcohol thing, maybe with something else.

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:39
Um… The other… No, no, no, go ahead.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:41
And really… yeah, sorry to interrupt. I think the thing about the green screen is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:47
Base and green screen likely won’t be enough. There’s a third component there that is… whether it is hook or gimmick.

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:52
Yeah. Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:54
And I think gimmick is a better way of describing it than hook.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:58
But, like, what’s the gimmick? And that’s where you kind of have to internalize either what is special about me?

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:06
Or what am I prepared to do than most people wouldn’t do.

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:10
And that’s a… that’s a sliding scale of, like… like that guy with the camera of, like, whispering and, like, telling you to come here.

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:16
Like, he’s an actor, so he’s like, I wanted to, you know, he’s playing to his strengths of, let me be… let me be cute here.

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:23
Um, and then the psychologist guy, he had… what’s special about him is his age, and For you, it’s like, you know, what… what are the things? Just the top of my head, the fact that you living on a homestead, right? Like, that’s…

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:36
That there could be… not that you would become an influencer for OpenEd, but just in general, the idea that, like, that is something special that would inform your opinion on almost anything? Right? Like… That is a really unique lifestyle, right? Imagine, like, you replace that with, I’ve been a cowboy for 50 years. Like, I’m listening. I’m listening. If you’re a cowboy, and now you’re gonna talk about Apple, I guess I’m listening.

[Charlie Deist] 12:45:46
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:58
Like, it’s cool. And so, like, what is special and cool about you?

[Andrew Muto] 12:46:03
And then… like… Is that something you say? Is that something that you show?

[Charlie Deist] 12:46:09
Right, right. Yeah, or, you know, is there a way… to crowdsource this within the company, the moms, the homeschool moms.

[Andrew Muto] 12:46:17
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 12:46:19
Like, I think that what… Right, again, if it works, then I’m in trouble, because… if I have, like, a big stable of people that can share their iPhone footage.

[Charlie Deist] 12:46:31
For example, and it’s cute, and it’s… aesthetic, whatever. Um… That could be replicable, and especially if the… kind of real content and gimmick of the video doesn’t necessarily depend on having something specific in the footage. The footage is just there to create the mood.

[Charlie Deist] 12:46:50
Um, if it’s… If I need something more specific from the footage, maybe having one specific go-to person who has a little bit of the… the acting background. I mean, the format that’s kind of jumping out to me, if it works, and I’d have to test this, and maybe I can just

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:05
Finish the reel that I’m working on to test it, but it’s like… Um, I can do, like, top 5 tools for X all day long, or things like that, because I’ve… I’ve been, you know, curating these pieces of content for the newsletter. I’ve got all kinds of curriculum databases and things like that.

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:22
You know, I can get as niche or broad as… and I feel like that’s sort of the George Lucas thing of, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:29
What people want. They kind of want these, like, quick, digestible videos where they maybe feel like They, um… you know, they got something of… They might not even act on it, but in what… like… I fall for it still, where it’s like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:45
You know, top 5 AI tools, whatever, for… X, I don’t know. Um… And kind of with that frame of, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:47:49
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:54
Finish your schooling faster, you know, um… I’m not sure. But how does that…

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:02
Well, it does, it makes sense. I think what you’re describing, though, sounds like like, when we were talking before about the, hey, let’s find people in the company that are prepared to talk about something, and I think we spitballed, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:48:13
Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:14
Right? I think that’s its own content category. And what you… what you showed me a moment ago of, I have a topic that I want to expound on that is more… U2B slash infographic-y slash, you know, like, it’s not a personal…

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:31
Experience. It is much more an education thing. That feels like its own content category.

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:37
Right? That would require its own hook. And so this content category uses a hook, right? This content category uses an entirely different hook.

[Charlie Deist] 12:48:42
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:45
That you don’t need to use. The best would be… And what I’m jealous of on my account is that I really only have one really solid one.

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:52
It would be great if you could build multiple pillars, right? So some days it is five things that you need to know. And then another day would be, like, this interesting historical fact.

[Charlie Deist] 12:48:55
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:05
And something else would be, like, you know, news of the day.

[Charlie Deist] 12:49:08
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:09
Great, and it’s like, I have different methodologies to deliver each one. This one is green screen guy.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:15
And I… and let’s say I’m just spitballing, you’re a green screen guy. And this is, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:49:15
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:20
Expert mom, and this is Faceless, right? This is something else.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:24
Like, that would be cool. Those… you’re chasing down these three things independently, or more, or less, you know, but each one of these could be its own thing. And then, theoretically.

[Charlie Deist] 12:49:32
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:33
Let’s say green screen guy took off. You could try green screen guy with 5 tips, or you can try Green Screen Guy with anything.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:41
Or, if the moms took off, or one specific mom took off, like, it’s… it’s just kind of subdividing up what you’re trying to do, and be like, what here is working?

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:50
And it all doesn’t need to be the same if I have different things I want to talk about. Like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:49:51
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:56
The historical education story that you had on your document a moment ago of just, like, here are all the different subjects.

[Andrew Muto] 12:50:04
Right? Or different interesting… historical facts.

[Andrew Muto] 12:50:09
That doesn’t need to be… the, um… UGC inside of the… organization style.

[Charlie Deist] 12:50:18
Yeah. Two… two questions. One is, like, so… when I look at my weekly numbers analytics for, like, you know, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, okay, I see that we got, you know, 22 new YouTube followers.

[Charlie Deist] 12:50:33
We got 50 new Instagram followers and 60 new Facebook followers, or something like that. And I’m, you know, like, those numbers are keeping me afloat, like, they’re getting me close to my… my KPIs for this quarter. Um, I’m banking on…

[Andrew Muto] 12:50:41
Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 12:50:48
Or I’m… like, I’m wanting to get that, uh, 10x growth at some point. You know, I’m not expecting it in the next month, or two months, or even the next you know, quarter or year, but at some point, I feel like I am going to find that

[Andrew Muto] 12:50:55
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:00
I’m gonna hit it, and then I can use that for… I mean, that’s… That’s my sort of gold standard, and I think that this whole conversation points towards that. Um, at the level of, like, keeping things afloat, keeping the numbers kind of going up.

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:13
Um, in that incremental way, if I wanted to see, okay, on Facebook, like, where are these new followers coming from?

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:20
Um, I should know how to do that, but, like. Do you know, sort of, it’s somewhere in, like, metabusiness Suite, or on Instagram, maybe Instagram would be the…

[Andrew Muto] 12:51:24
Yeah. That’s a good question. Like, where they are coming from is a question that I don’t know. You can see… traffic source per video.

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:36
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:51:36
I’m not sure you can tell traffic source from followers. But you might be able to say video source. Let me just pop into my, um, Facebook app here real quick.

[Andrew Muto] 12:51:46
Um, I don’t use the business suite, I just use Facebook’s professional dashboard, it’s called.

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:52
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 12:51:53
Um, let me see, insights here…

[Andrew Muto] 12:52:07
I don’t see sources for followers.

[Charlie Deist] 12:52:10
Yeah, it’s… right now, I don’t… I don’t either. I’ll look into that with ChatGBT a little bit. What I was gonna… get at was, um… This idea that, like, I think one of the reasons I was feeling over… a little overwhelmed this morning was, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:52:25
I had written out an intention that this week, I’m gonna kind of define my procedure for taking a newsletter and then spinning that out into different social media posts. And by the nature of the newsletter is mostly text and image.

[Andrew Muto] 12:52:38
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 12:52:41
Sometimes I’ll put a real embed a reel in the newsletter, but usually I’m going in the other direction of repurposing from the short form to the newsletter. So with this, I’m just kind of thinking, what are some easy post… like, I can post a link on Facebook

[Andrew Muto] 12:52:51
Well, I think… I think I feel your pain, because I feel like I’ve been in your shoes before, where You’re trying to do a couple things at the same time. One is.

[Charlie Deist] 12:52:54
With, you know, some kind of… engagement-type question. And, like, sometimes that stuff does okay, usually it doesn’t do Great, and it never goes gangbusters, but… Um… I feel like I attribute some of our growth on social media just to the fact that

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:14
I’m kind of keeping things alive, and I don’t know when one might get 1,000 views and a dozen shares, or something like that.

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:22
And, um… So, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:27
Do you think it’s worth it, in a sense? Like…

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:36
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:53:38
I’m assuming somewhere in the organization, you were asked to deliver, like, KPIs. Like, what do you… what number are you gonna hit?

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:45
Right. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:53:45
And you had to toss a number out. And that number is based on what seems like reasonably possible, based on your current trajectory. Maybe there’s a little bit of math behind that, but kind of it is just really guessing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:57
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:53:57
And so now you’ve got that number in your head. You’re also aware of the fact that, like, your method here, which is ideation and creation, is not solid, so we’re still kind of hunting for that.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:09
And then the thirdly, it is the process of just, like, when I wake up, like, I should know what I’m doing. I’m in control of my own destiny.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:16
Am I making short form? And, like, what is due today? Show me my schedule.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:20
I feel the pain on all of that. So, starting with one, the KPIs thing, and you might not be in a situation to do this, and I know we’re… you’ve already done this, but… I was asked for KPIs all the time at Hoover, and I would consistently push back.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:34
Of, like, guys, I’m not a… I’m not a fortune teller. What do you want me to say? I don’t… I don’t extrapolate into the future based on a kind of asymmetric growth over the course of a year. Like, I can see bumps all over, and I can see One month, I got 1,500 followers, and another month, we got 72,000.

[Charlie Deist] 12:54:51
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:52
How am I supposed to project what’s gonna happen in the next month or the next 12 months? There’s no sense behind it, and… Um, all I can… all I can say to you is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:01
Let me show you my everyday work and how we’re slaying ourselves to, like, push this forward.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:05
And I may… and inevitably, we dramatically would overshoot anything we ever would have guessed.

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:05
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:11
But KPIs are really tough in social media because people are asking to be lied to, really, about… and so that’s something that… I would always keep in the back of your mind, and I don’t know how much political capital one would have to spend to push back on that, and I wouldn’t ask you to kill yourself, but…

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:16
Right, right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:23
Yeah, in some sense, I might just kind of leave it alone, because at least this quarter, like, I’m coming in right about at what I forecast, just based on the secular growth.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:29
Yeah. Sure. So I think that’s a good place to be, that if you’re hitting it, then I would say put the KPIs aside, because it’s a really difficult thing to go after.

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:34
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:41
Right? You can… I think that you could say, like, am I up or down for the month? I mean, that’s a number that all these platforms give you. And that gives you a sense of, like, am I trending in the right direction?

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:41
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:51
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:52
Um, but that’s all I would pay attention to, personally. Yeah, jumping to the third thing.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:59
It’s very difficult, because you said you woke up today and you wanted to try to work on on newsletter, and try to figure out, like, what am I doing for the newsletter, and how does that affect short form?

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:09
I think all of this is kind of like, you’re still hunting for what works, and it’s very difficult to build process when you haven’t figured out what really works. The good news is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:24
That you have found, like, micro-success, and that you’re doing great on that. Like, you’re showing up every day. And that’s, like, 80% of the battle.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:32
Now it is just a matter of, like, nose to the grindstone, trying to innovate every day, and something here is gonna work, and you’re like, oh shit, I can do that 50,000 times, no problem.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:42
That’s all you’re waiting on. So, you’re gonna hit your KPI numbers, assuming they weren’t extravagantly elevated.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:48
And you’re gonna keep on keeping on if you’re showing up every day publishing content. If you take your foot off that gas.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:56
I think that’s where things can be problematic. But I would say try to not build processes until you know what’s working.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:04
Because I’ve used this analogy before of McDonald’s, of you don’t… build an entire franchisee system.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:15
If you’re not already selling a billion cheeseburgers every day. If you’re selling a billion cheeseburgers every day.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:21
You build a process to keep that happening. If people love your cheeseburgers, you want to make sure you’re building them at a reasonable schedule. But if no one wants your cheeseburgers.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:32
You don’t build a process in which to build more cheeseburgers people don’t want.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:37
And that was something that I struggled with, too, that somehow it feels like process is what informs success. And in the creative space, that’s almost never true.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:47
In… in a manufacturing space, maybe, but, um… what you want to do is find out what works, and then build a process around that, that you can make that as often as possible.

[Charlie Deist] 12:57:54
Yeah. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:01
And so I would try to be as loosey-goosey until you can figure it out, because, like, maybe you discover short form does power the news… the newsletter, and that’s what makes the newsletter take off, or vice versa, that the…

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:13
The other way to look at, or an additional thing to mention, is you don’t need the newsletter to get you Instagram traffic, or social media traffic, because that’s what the algo’s supposed to do for you. That’s the genius So, really, it should only be in the other direction, likely.

[Charlie Deist] 12:58:20
No. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:30
And you probably get way more data with short form, and you can pump it out quicker, that, like, make as much short-form content as possible to inform what does and does not work.

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:41
Try to get a pulse on the audience.

[Charlie Deist] 12:58:43
Yeah, I guess I’m just thinking, like, let’s say that I had tried to repurpose that Gen Z image into a still image. Like, just put, you know, I put it on branded background or something like that, or even lower-fi. I literally just post, like, a cropped version of that

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:56
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:00
This kind of fits the dimensions, and then I have a little bit of the caption.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:03
Uh, and I do that consistently with one piece of content from the newsletter.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:08
That’s visual every, every day. And then in other cases, if there’s a really, really awesome quote that just hits, like, a, you know, heavy-hitting one-liner kind of thing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:17
Um, again, I put that into our Canva template. And it just goes up, because when I look at our… Instagram, when I look at our feed of other people, I’ll share my screen again one more time really quick.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:29
A lot of what I see are this style of post, um… like, like, okay, this a little bit, um… this a little… well, these are carousels And my read is that, for one, carousels are primarily getting shown to your own audience. They’re not as good for

[Andrew Muto] 12:59:46
Yes.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:47
Getting shown to others. So until we have, like, a really big audience, the data’s gonna be somewhat limited.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:54
Um, you know, here’s another one, uh… Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:59:56
I think even with a big audience, the expectation is for sub-20% of people to see your carousel, or photo.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:03
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:04
At any scale, so you have a million followers, only 20% are gonna see them, likely.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:08
Right, right. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:10
The other thing I would say about this experience is. This isn’t how I would recommend consuming Instagram. I would say that I would pop into reels on your phone, or I guess you’re… I never do it on the web, but you could…

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:21
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:23
And consume it this way. Because… Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:26
The only thing is, this is… this is all about social media for some reason.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:30
Which is still maybe not bad, it’s still probably… I can extrapolate a lot from that.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:32
Well, the only thing right now, the only thing you’re trying to suck up is tactic.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:37
So, ignore the content. Pretend the content’s just blank, and it’s like, oh, somebody does a thing where they turn to the camera and say a word just started, or… bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, text. Okay, that… I’m stealing tactics.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:38
Right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:52
And you could apply this to recipes, or open ed, or whatever.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:52
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:56
Um, but that’s what you’re hunting for. Just hunt for tactics.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:00
When you’re scrolling through this. And this takes the noise out of carousels and images.

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:00
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:06
Because those are not, like, a really sustainable long-term tactic right now.

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:08
Yeah. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:13
Or short-term tech. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:14
Yeah, so, I mean, in some sense, like, you know, maybe just keep it level, but don’t, um, with the posting on the platforms, those other formats, but… uh, don’t invest in building out too much of an advanced system for it until I…

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:29
Figure out what works.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:30
Personally, I think that’s how I would do it. I think different… this comes down to how different people work.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:35
Um, and I like structure. But I don’t want the structure to dictate my innovation ability, right? So, on Instagram, I am, like, locked in on how I do it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:47
On YouTube, I’m like, I don’t know. On YouTube, I’m, like, still trying to, like, be very malleable from even camera systems to… schedules, because I haven’t figured out what works yet.

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:55
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:59
And if I were to figure out, like, oh, this type of review always works with this thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:06
Then I’d build incredible time management systems around that, of like, alright, this is how I generate that thumbnail, I’m gonna make, like, a… Like, it crossed my mind the other day, I was like, oh man, I don’t have a bunch of, like, good photos of me

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:19
Like, doing this for thumbnails, right? Like, all the stuff, like, angry, and, like, happy, and, like, I was like, you know, I should probably suit up and, like, shoot a bunch of those, I’ll get the white background, I’ll kind of make… and I was like, wait, what the fuck am I doing?

[Charlie Deist] 13:02:23
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:30
I don’t even know if that’ll work yet. I shouldn’t suit up for that. That’s a… that’s a 4-hour time suck.

[Charlie Deist] 13:02:31
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:34
I need to prove out on one of them, maybe, that, like, this is even necessary before I build that process. Um… That’s how I think of it personally, because otherwise, you’ll build all these processes that support the creation of a product that no one wants.

[Charlie Deist] 13:02:50
Right, right. No, that makes… that makes perfect sense. Um, and I mean, like, X is a perfect example of just, like, I have a theory, but I haven’t been able to crack the the nut of X in any way, like, and when I look at my content on X, I cringe, so…

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:55
Um.

[Charlie Deist] 13:03:07
It’s no surprise that, uh, others are not exactly flocking to retweet it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:12
But I, I mean, I think you’re… what you said about the under… the Gen Z drinking really resonated with me, because I feel like that is the problem I felt like I had with Delvin.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:24
I was like, I know how to take street photos. I know that that video… short-form video content is what works on social media. How do I square that circle?

[Charlie Deist] 13:03:34
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:36
And then it was like, okay, wait, maybe POV content. But how does… how do I wear it? And then I tried a bunch of things, and none of it felt right. It felt really laborious, and I was like, this is a fucking nightmare.

[Charlie Deist] 13:03:45
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:48
And I really… you know, because I started thinking, well, maybe it’s not POV content, maybe… and I had all these… maybe… and you could scroll all the way back and kind of see some of the nonsense I was trying.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:58
And, um… I think that’s the journey of, like, you need to throw a lot of noodles at the wall.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:05
Um, consciously. Of, like, I’m trying this out, I’m trying out Talking Podcast Head Guy.

[Charlie Deist] 13:04:12
I can do Talking Pothead Guy.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:12
I’m trying. You know, I’m trying the caption thing, right? And if you want to make your life easy, do your ver- shoot it with you first.

[Charlie Deist] 13:04:21
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:24
Right? Like, you know, it’ll take you 4 seconds to be like, meh, meh, you know, like… And then at least you can try it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:04:30
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:34
Um. There may be… there, you know… Well, I was gonna… I was about to say, there might be something to… men talking to women.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:45
Like, like, an engaged male parent. Talking to women, where women often may feel as though they are the ones in charge of the education and the the children and stuff. Why wouldn’t it be great to have a guy helping support like this? Like, there… I can see some magic there. Like, my wife’s complaint is I’m not as involved in the…

[Andrew Muto] 13:05:03
You know, the parent-teacher conferences, as much as I’m sure she would like, and so if a man was talking, she’d be like, see this fucking guy, why can’t my husband be like this? Like, sometimes that’s enough, right? Like, sometimes that’s like, oh, that’s the guy that’s super helpful, and… Um, you know, women flock to that, theoretically.

[Charlie Deist] 13:05:18
Right, right. Yeah. Okay, well, uh, once again, I’ve got a lot to chew on here.

[Charlie Deist] 13:05:29
And I… Wrote down some notes for my to-dos, but I’m gonna have to go through the transcript again and pull out I’ve got some ideas, but yeah, thinking about the gimmick, thinking in terms of the gimmick first.

[Andrew Muto] 13:05:42
Yeah, and I know we… it does… I know you do have a lot on your plate, because, like, you’re… you’re actually trying to keep all these boats afloat with what you’ve been doing, right? Of, like, newsletter, YouTube video, podcast, short form.

[Andrew Muto] 13:05:53
All that makes sense. And you’re gonna have to keep that going, while also finding time to innovate on something new.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:00
Kind of R&D, theoretically. And maybe the R&D overlaps with some of the short form. You’re like, well, no one you know, you’re in charge, so you can decide. Maybe… all the stuff I post this week will all be R&D, or next week, let’s say.

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:01
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:13
But I would try to be deliberate about, like, alright, this is what I’m trying.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:17
This week, and… and keep your aspirations smaller. You don’t have to do all these options, right?

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:24
Figure out, like, what am I gonna tackle this week? I’m gonna tackle green screen guy.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:28
Cool. Or, I’m gonna tackle this, and I’m gonna do, like, 5 variations on this.

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:28
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:33
And try… like, pick your battles, and then deploy it, and then see what happens. As opposed to… trying to do a little bit of everything, and the data will come in so slowly, where it’s like, well, I guess let’s just do this for a couple weeks, and then see…

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:34
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:45
What happens? If you can do this, you know, over the course of a week or more on one idea, we can look and evaluate, is any of this working?

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:53
Yep. Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:58
Sounds good, sounds like a plan.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:58
That’d be my advice. Yeah. Yeah, man. Um, and, um, you have the other invite for Friday.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:05
Same time. Um, and yeah… No, no problem, no problem at all. Yeah, um, and hopefully this is getting you in the right direction. I… but I can… if ever you’re feeling like you’re off the reservation, one, I’m always around if you want to chat.

[Charlie Deist] 13:07:06
Perfect. Yeah, we can do… we can do… keep it short, but, um, yeah, appreciate this. This is… this has been great.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:20
Just ping me, be like, hey, can I get a couple minutes? I… you can just use me as a whiteboard of… chatting it through. But two, this is the process.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:29
You’re not off the reservation by, like, I’ve got a lot I’m chewing on, I want to try this, but it feels like I’m overwhelmed, there’s so many things floating around.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:37
This is that creative process, and sometimes it feels hectic, and sometimes it’s like I’m staring at a wall, I’m like, I just don’t have anything good right now.

[Charlie Deist] 13:07:44
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:44
And that is what it’s like that I… I’ve… done this many times in my life, where it’s like, even though I’m successful, quote-unquote.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:53
There’s still a lot of, like, oh my god, there’s so much… my mind is going a million miles a minute, and, like.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:59
That’s not bad. I would say that’s just part of the experience of… trying to find the solution to a creative problem.

[Charlie Deist] 13:08:09
Yeah, yeah. Well, that, that’s comforting.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:15
Yeah, yeah. I would embrace it, I guess. What I see… what I saw on the corporate side was that people would either be a part of this process who are not creative, and they would start to panic.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:26
And try to apply, like, business leadership shit to it, of like, we’re just gonna do this! And it’s like, well, that’s not even how it works.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:33
I wish it’d be that easy to just dictate. It is. You kind of have to be this weird, soft sponge until something works, and then… sharpen up to, like, we’re doing that now, because that worked. That worked really well, and now I’m gonna triple down, and I’m not gonna sleep, and I’m gonna make 15,000 of these videos.

[Charlie Deist] 13:08:35
Right, right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 13:08:45
Yep. Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 13:08:50
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:51
But until then, you’re kind of like, I don’t know, maybe it’s this, maybe it’s a little bit of that. You’re making these micro-differences that maybe only you can see.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:58
And until finally, it’s like, oh… like, my wife wouldn’t have known the difference between a POV camera on my chest or a POV camera on my eyes, but to me, I was like, I know the very specific difference between those two things, and I’m trying to get a very specific type of reaction in a video.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:13
And, like, it’s all that micro-nuance that you kind of just have to fuck with until, like, you’re like, oh, this is working.

[Charlie Deist] 13:09:20
Right, right. Yeah, I love that analogy, the sponge.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:27
Yeah, just be very okay with not having an answer about some of this stuff. This is what the process feels like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:09:27
The sponge, and then…

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:32
It can be stressful inside of an environment where there are leaders who are used to clear-cut black and white answers.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:40
And if any of those… if you’re feeling stressed of any of that, I’m happy to talk that through, too, at some point. But, like.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:45
I would say try to just, like, it’s okay that you’re sorting this out.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:48
And just keep trying, but just try to be diligent about, like, I’m gonna try just one thing at a time.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:54
You know, as opposed to, like, I’m gonna do a bunch of different stuff, and, like, it’s gonna be…

[Charlie Deist] 13:09:58
Right, right. All right, onward.

[Andrew Muto] 13:10:03
Cool? Yeah, man. All right, buddy, um, I hope you have a good week. Let me know, I’m always around. If anything comes up, just, um, ping me, and I’ll hop on a call.

[Charlie Deist] 13:10:12
Sounds good. Thanks again

Here are the key points about titles and thumbnails from the discussion:

- The title and thumbnail work together as a combination - they should complement each other rather than repeat the same information
- The thumbnail should offer something extra beyond what's in the title. For example, a title about "6 months with Ray-Ban Smart Glasses" paired with a thumbnail suggesting "It has one problem" creates intrigue
- Target click-through rate metrics:
    - Below 4% is considered low
    - 4-6% is the ideal range
    - Above 6% is excellent performance

For poorly performing videos, the first thing to evaluate is the click-through rate. If it's below 4%, try changing the title and thumbnail to improve performance.

Remember that low view counts are usually due to poor "packaging" (title/thumbnail) rather than poor video content.

June 13 (1)

[Charlie Deist] 13:17:34
Right, right. Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:17:35
And I… if I can gain that audience now through… I'm gonna talk about the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, I'm gonna talk about the Insta360 GO 3S, If I could talk about these things in, like, practical… practical reasons as to why they are or are not good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:17:51
That audience hopefully comes with me. Over time, when they kind of fall in love with my schtick, and they really like this guy, so when I'm talking… when I'm doing, like, a daily vlog, they're like, this is cool.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:00
I'll follow this guy. And so they will… you get them with one, you hold them for the other.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:06
I also tend to believe that, like. Who doesn't want somebody to fall in love with philosophy?

[Charlie Deist] 13:18:06
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:12
Of anything. But I think that's a lot tougher. Um, especially when it's pure philosophy, when it's pure… here is an ideology.

[Charlie Deist] 13:18:14
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:23
Sometimes, I think you can couch that ideology in… because the only thing that's good about the tips and tricks, it isn't… A tip and trick to get your kid to enjoy blah blah blah. It's 5.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:34
Right? Like, if you can do the philosophy stuff. With 5.

[Charlie Deist] 13:18:34
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:40
Then I think you can have both. And so I think that's where… that's something to consider, too. It's like, I would go after the tips and tricks, because I do think it would likely get you… the audience you're looking for and the numbers you're looking for. The question that any reasonable person would have is.

[Charlie Deist] 13:18:43
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:58
Can I hold onto those people long-term? Or did I… or was it a very cheap view?

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:02
That doesn't build brand. Great question. Um, and then there's the philosophy stuff, and then if you can couch the philosophy stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 13:19:04
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:09
Along with what you're doing, which, like, we're really tightening up the way you're making the videos, the way you're packaging the first 2 or 3 seconds, but if we also use some of those hooks from the tips and tricks of, like, the five reasons why, and get these guys to say it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:19:25
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:25
Or to edit that, right? To, like… like, on the screen right here, there's a… I'm looking at a grid of 12 videos, I see 7 or 8 faces. If you cut together a very quick 5 different people with one or two sentences. Like, the five things that suck about

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:45
Public school. And then, you know, there are 5 different interviews from 5 different people. Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. It's like, oh, shit.

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:53
That's cool. But, like. It's really the tactic that you could probably sell any… well, I mean, maybe… current public discourse… makes this very clear. You can sell any stupid idea with the tactic of, like, 5 reasons why, right? Like…

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:10
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:11
People will follow dummies into hell, because they have, like, you know, 5 blah blah blah. It's like, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:17
That's… the packaging of that tactic is really the value, not really what the substance is.

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:24
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:24
As we see every single day, right? Like, substance seems to be lost, but everybody's listening to the tactic.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:31
And some of these folks have gotten so very good at packaging tactic.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:35
That they now have massive audiences. And it's like, well, but what you're saying is crazy? But it's like, yeah, but you're really good at packaging.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:41
So, got it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:42
Right, right, right. Yeah. Um, a couple thoughts that come to mind.

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:48
One is, uh, the podcast archive. I've always just selected gun clips from within a single episode.

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:56
But the idea of kind of a mash-up of different podcast clips is sort of intriguing.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:02
Yeah, it could be cool.

[Charlie Deist] 13:21:02
Um, and I feel like… yeah, I feel like, you know, that's something where I'd be curious to see what I'd get if I just stuck And the muscle memory is there for editing podcast clips, so it's a little less of a barrier. But if I just jammed, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:21:15
6 or 7 sort of similar-themed guests into one chat with ChatGPT, like, I could probably come up with a handful of concepts that would be like a… little supercut or a mashup.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:28
Yeah, yeah. And I think that's probably easier than… the hook setup? Like, what is that hook setup, right? And That's something to just experiment with on its own, right? Of just, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:21:34
Mm-hmm. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:41
You know, how can I, in two seconds, do this thing?

[Charlie Deist] 13:21:45
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:45
Right? Like, and it doesn't need to be you, right? But it's like, what if it is… it's already written out on crayon on a desk over the shoulder of a kid, right? But then you let your child finish it, as though they wrote it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:59
Or what if it's, like, magnets on a refrigerator? You know, and, like, a little kid finger pushing the last few into place. You know, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:00
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:08
What is the hook that can get people to listen to the rest of it?

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:13
Um. Van Nystadt, his hook is that typewriter.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:19
Right? Of that… are you familiar… have we talked about this? Okay, so Van Nystad is Casey Neistat's brother.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:20
Hmm. No.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:24
And every video of his essentially starts with a typewriter typing out kind of the name of the video essay you're about to watch. And it's like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:31
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:34
And it's like, you know, an extreme macro close-up of a typewriter.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:38
Yeah, I'm checking this out.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:38
And, um. And so you can… you know, and it's… now it's more of a… his hallmark that it is a hook. But, like, it worked in the beginning.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:52
Right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:55
And… and so it's like, what is a hook that you can start to own and control that is gonna get people to come back?

[Charlie Deist] 13:23:05
And to what extent do you think that the idea really has to be in the video itself versus the text hook? Like, what if… I'm almost feeling like there's just so many videos where somehow they get you… it is the combination of the two.

[

ou know, but it's one of those oddly satisfying kind of things, where it's like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:23:53
Or, uh, or, yeah, I mean, it could… I probably could find… Right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:23:55
Or it's melted all over a kid's face, right? Like… It's the… it's the first shot is the shot you're trying to avoid.

[Charlie Deist] 13:24:03
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:24:03
Right? So, this is something I did for Hoover, where, um… it was… it started with my son eating ice cream, and he's a disaster in the car.

[Andrew Muto] 13:24:14
And then it cuts to our clean slate spot cleaner that has… that's battery-powered that you can use in the car. It was our highest performing ad of all time. That is probably the most Highest performing Hoover ad in the history of Hoover ads. That, like, it played for 2 years, and it was… it was shot in a phone, and it was shitty. It was like, you know, he's covered up. It was like America's home video quality. Like, it was nothing.

[Charlie Deist] 13:24:28
That's hilarious.

[Charlie Deist] 13:24:38
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:24:40
Um, but it played so good because it started with this disaster of a kid covered in ice cream that was melting all over his face, clearly on the car, in the car, and mom over the shoulder, you know, saying, like, hey, you're a mess! Something like that.

[Charlie Deist] 13:24:54
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:24:54
And so, like, you know, you could say, you know, 5 snacks that don't melt in the car, and then you seeing the melting of, like, oh shit, I'm gonna watch this.

[Charlie Deist] 13:25:04
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:05
Um, but to your point, or I think what you were kind of asking was.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:10
You kind of presumptively solve whatever you're setting up. Right? But I think that's a sliding scale the more you are an abstract philosophy territory.

[Charlie Deist] 13:25:14
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:19
Right? Like… If you're talking about some grandiose idea.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:24
You have probably more wiggle room as to… here is my suggestion as to how to beat depression.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:30
Theoretically, right? Like, that… if that's the subject, how… 5 ways to cure depression you probably have some wiggle room. But 5 snacks that don't melt in the car, I think that's pretty… I think… I think that's accomplishable.

[Charlie Deist] 13:25:37
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:47
An example of something I did today was I published a video on Velvet that was Um, watch me get turned down.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:53
And the first 3 seconds of the video is me going up to a girl, she says no.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:59
And then it cuts to… her coming up to me later, and her friend saying she changed her mind, now she knows who you are, she'll take the photo. Okay. And then, so we watch the rest of the video.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:09
So, the video, 85-95% of that video is not me being turned down.

[Charlie Deist] 13:26:16
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:17
But it's not clickbait. Right? Like, I think all you're trying to do is avoid the clickbait. The concept of clickbait, so that when people finish the video, they're like, fuck you, that was not the video I… That's… that… yeah, that's all you're trying to avoid. Like, some frustration. And I… and you know what?

[Charlie Deist] 13:26:27
Right, okay, so that's how you define clickbait. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:36
That's not even a black and white thing. So, for instance, I also published a video that did really well, which was a guy who has this, like, skeleton tattoo on his hand.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:46
And, um, I walk up to him, like, this guy is, you know, iconic or something, was the text, and I was like, man, you're great, I love that tattoo, you look fucking great, blah blah blah blah blah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:55
The comments are filled with, like, that guy sucks. I hate that tattoo, like, everybody hated it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:00
And so it's like, I actually gave you exactly what I said I was gonna give you, but people disagree.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:06
And it's like, oh, okay. But now the video's still got great views, because the algo doesn't understand bad sentiment. So that video just goes to the moon anyway. And that's another… That's another tactic that, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:27:12
Right. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:17
I don't know what you'd want to call them, dark YouTubers will do of, like.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:21
They are actively antagonizing their audience for views, right? Of, like, everybody flies into the comments, and that's not our game, and almost assuredly not your game.

[Charlie Deist] 13:27:26
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:32
Um, but it is a tactic that, like, even if you feel like you're on the edge here, people are gonna get frustrated, that frustration may play to your short-term advantage of getting a lot of views.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:42
Um, and then, like, you may get in front of even more people that agree with you.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:48
Because the algo's like, well, great, I'm gonna send this to a shit ton more people.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:52
Um, which is what I… like, on Facebook, that, that, um, I… it was, like, one of my most popular videos ever.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:57
Of this tattoo guy. It was very… it was earlier this week. And I got, like, a hundred and… thousand views on Facebook. We're normally at, like, 5,000 views on Facebook.

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:06
And it was… vast majority of people, like, I hate this guy's tattoo, blah blah blah. But Biago doesn't know the difference, and it's just like… Sends it to everybody.

[Charlie Deist] 13:28:12
Right. What was the tattoo? What was wrong with the tattoo?

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:16
Well, I don't think I even noticed if it was poorly done, but the guys got, like, um, literally, it's like an x-ray of his hand, so there's, like, it's just… you know, phones. It's a very aggressive hand tattoo.

[Charlie Deist] 13:28:25
I see, yeah, yeah. Kind of creepy, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:30
And, um, people were just ragging on him about it, but I thought he looked cool. I thought he had the guts to do it, like, that looks cool, and… Um, it was… I had a fun interaction, but, um, Facebook, you know, and Facebook's…

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:43
Tough. No one… says nice things on Facebook.

[Charlie Deist] 13:28:46
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:47
Um, so, uh, but, like, yeah, I think you need to… attempt to avoid the concept that you have tripped the audience into something. But I think that's a really wide… you know, like… had a… I don't know, I'm trying to even think of an example of clickbait, like…

[Andrew Muto] 13:29:07
The battery that lasts forever. And then it doesn't last forever, is probably clickbait.

[Charlie Deist] 13:29:14
Okay, right, right, right, yeah. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:29:15
Unless it's rechargeable, right? And then, like, well, yeah, and again, if you confront the clickbait, you're probably fine. Like, no, I know, you guys saw the title thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 13:29:25
But you don't have to recharge it. But after that, it does last forever. I don't know, it's probably safe. It's probably fine.

[Charlie Deist] 13:29:32
Yeah. I… so, I mean, thinking about one like that, you know, messy… messy phase, 5 snacks that don't melt in the car.

[Charlie Deist] 13:29:40
Again, just thinking, like, what's the fastest way to get the assets for that video? I was looking into… websites, like, you know, stock video websites that kind of specialize in a more raw, authentic, user-generated content feel, iPhone footage.

[Charlie Deist] 13:29:56
Still haven't really found anything that is, like. Easy to get into and go. Actually, I was about to put something in the newsletter today.

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:05
Kind of like a… win a, you know, win a t-shirt by entering, um, just, like, fill out this Google form and upload a couple phone videos, and each video that you upload will be an entry into the competition.

[Andrew Muto] 13:30:18
Ooh, that's interesting.

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:18
Um… But the parameters were pretty vague. It was, like, something like, you know, show us what your homeschool kind of feels like, and feel free to do facelift, you know, faceless videos are fine, it can just be… anything, just to sort of have a library of diverse, um…

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:38
On, you know, maybe kind of on point. But I could also be more specific with the prompt.

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:42
Um, and it might be a little bit safer to first explore this internally in our company Slack.

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:48
Since we do have, like, 40 or 50, mom, teacher, like, people that fit both demographics.

[Andrew Muto] 13:30:54
Yeah. Well, um… My… I mean, my instinct is always to attempt it myself first, before I try to go to others, because, like, I want to understand, like… because there's things you don't know, like, what is the structure of this video? How long does each video need to be?

[Charlie Deist] 13:31:10
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:10
How many… how many cuts do I have? Let's say in any given segment, or the whole video, like, what am I trying to do? And once I know that, I'll know kind of what I'm asking.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:20
And, you know, what you're asking for a recipe video is likely different than what you're asking for, like, a philosophical education video, let's say, or just B-roll.

[Charlie Deist] 13:31:21
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 13:31:29
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:31
And so, um, it really depends. I mean, like, the… the recipe video one, I would probably try to accomplish myself initially, of like, I'm just gonna make 5 things this weekend.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:42
And… boom, boom, and I'm gonna try to document them, and then… but what I… but instead of making it difficult to, like, document every scoop of whatever. I am going to shoot the end result of each one.

[Charlie Deist] 13:31:42
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:54
And then recipe in the description. For, you know, like, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, like… Number 5, number 4, number 3, number 2, number 4.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:04
All in there. That might be a way to do it. And then I will film my child with a chocolatey mess.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:10
Like, then that'll be the text. So it's… it's gonna be essentially 5 shots… 6 shots.

[Charlie Deist] 13:32:15
Right. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:17
Messy face, recipe 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The glamour shots, and… of each meal.

[Charlie Deist] 13:32:25
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:26
And then you're gonna write it up. That's how I would try that first.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:30
Um, and then… the newsletter thing's a great idea, and using the slack of an employee is a great idea. I think it's just figuring out, like, what am I trying… to get out of them. Am I trying to get B-roll of their kids

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:43
Playing outside, then that would be the… because I have this idea for a handful of videos where I need kids running on swing sets and the whole thing.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:51
Because I'm going to talk about next week, how video… how, um… kids who have more free time, or more blah blah blah blah blah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:59
So I need footage for that. So here's the newsletter. I think that's a way to go. That's how I would probably go about it if I really needed footage.

[Charlie Deist] 13:33:09
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:10
Um, alternatively, though, I would probably try to film it myself first, again, just to confirm oh, I know the structure of this video.

[Charlie Deist] 13:33:19
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:19
Like, I've got my own kids, and I know it's like, oh, actually, you know what? It's gonna take 12 shots to put this together, because I use this trending audio, and there's a cut.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:28
On every beat, and there's 12 beats, and it's like, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:31
Cool. Um… Theoretically, you know, like, that's the nuance of what you're trying to accomplish.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:39
Um, and I always try to brute force it with myself first, even if it doesn't get published.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:44
Um, but that's how the Hoover thing came up, that the… the… there was all this rigmarole with the people who made our official commercials.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:55
We had, like, an in-house production team, and it was, like, dealing with them was, like, pulling teeth, because it was, like, they had all this stuff, and everything took fucking forever, and, like, blah blah. It's like, guys, I'm just gonna go home, and I'm gonna just shoot a version.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:05
I was gonna shoot the bad version, and fine, and everybody's like.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:09
Everybody said yes because they didn't care, and they're like, it's never gonna go anywhere. It's like, cool.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:14
Went home, literally shot it in my driveway with an iPhone.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:19
And it… it came back, and it was good enough, mostly because I'm an editor, I think, because I was able to make it feel really tight.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:28
And it was like, how is this not the video? How is this not the video that we… like, are we gonna redo this professionally? Like, this is the video.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:35
They're like, yeah, it's the video. I was like, okay, out the door. Um, and then it did really well.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:39
So I would say, try a version yourself, even… and in the back of your mind, say, I'm not even gonna publish this. This is just as, like, a demo. Like, this is what I'm looking for. And it might help in the Slack channel.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:51
So you could show… this is what I'm trying to accomplish.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:54
With your footage.

[Charlie Deist] 13:34:54
Right. Yeah, no, it makes sense, makes sense. And I feel like… If I get to the point where… I find a formula… where I can gather footage for… multiple future videos in that format.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:13
Then I can see myself doing that. I doubt I'll get to the… I doubt I'll ever do something where I, you know, do a whole… Um, ask for… Well, I don't know. On the company Slack, I can see myself asking for footage for a specific… for one specific video.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:27
Um, I don't think I would do that for our general audience, just because it's… Would be too much effort for one video, probably.

[Andrew Muto] 13:35:35
Yeah, I mean, I think if you had a series, like, if you had something where Um, I'm just making this up, but, like, your best piece of homeschool parenting advice.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:38
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:45
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:35:46
Give it… give it to us in under 30 seconds. And then you get it, and you cut it down to, like, a hot 17.

[Andrew Muto] 13:35:52
Seconds. Um, and let's say that that could be something for the newsletter, where it's like, now, I just got 75 inbound videos.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:54
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:00
From a single newsletter push. Now, theoretically, assuming all these are good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:04
I've got 75 posts that I can pepper out over the next 6 months.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:08
And that's just one… like, that's a great way of doing it. I mean, that's not a bad idea on its own, I'm sure, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:08
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:14
Of… I'm sure every parent's got homeschooling advice. Give me your homeschooling advice in 30 seconds.

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:22
Yeah, I mean, do you think that… do you think that could work?

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:25
Sure. Yeah, I mean, why not? And then, you know, you put a little piece of trending audio underneath it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:29
And then maybe you build, like, um… you know, there's some, like, on-screen text that kicks everyone off, uh… like, this is a real mom, you know, a little arrow.

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:41
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:42
Real… real open ed. I don't know what you… do you guys call them customers?

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:49
Families, just like families. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:49
Okay, real open ed family? Real open-end mom, like… That, I mean, that's an ad, too. I mean, that's… there's a lot going on there. Um… That could be super cool.

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:54
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 13:37:03
Yeah. Let me… let me see if I can run with that. Um…

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:08
Okay, the one call-out there is, um, I would chat with whoever you have on your side about legal to proper approval to use it. That can get weird.

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:19
Um, I fly fast and loose on the street because I'm not selling any of these images, and I'm in the public eye. But for businesses, for Hoover, we had all these rigmarole things. They'd actually sign the release and everything, and…

[Charlie Deist] 13:37:26
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:31
So UGC can get, like. Um… I don't want to say complicated, but it is more than just, like, somebody gave me a video. It's like, well, great, what What if that video works really well, and you guys buy ads against it, and you make a billion dollars? That person may come back and be like, yo, what the fuck?

[Charlie Deist] 13:37:48
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:51
Man, maybe you guys are already doing that, but just something to mention of, like, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:55
Usually, it's, like, by submitting this video, you are agreeing to our terms, and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, that we can… use it and put it on our Instagram, and… blah, blah, blah. For commercial use.

[Charlie Deist] 13:38:06
Right, get that… get that boilerplate, get that figured out.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:09
Yeah, yeah, and it's usually based on, like, if you submit, you agree to.

[Charlie Deist] 13:38:12
Right, right. Yeah, I had a little checkbox on the form that I drafted up, but I don't know if that would… Check all the actual legal boxes.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:13
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:23
Yeah, it's not… like, a lawyer, I don't know if you guys have, like, uh, counsel in-house or whatever, but it shouldn't be super complicated for them, it's just something that, if I were you.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:34
You know, kind of plan for success. In that regard, because if it it's a nightmare when it goes the wrong way.

[Charlie Deist] 13:38:41
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:41
They're like, oh, shit. Now I gotta take this down, and now there's, like, 12 people involved in the marketing team that are, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:38:51
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:53
Yeah, I remember when UGC started back in the day, and, like, it wasn't actually UGC. We used to send producers out to people's homes.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:01
And film fake UGC. This was, like, back in, like. Let's say 2010, where you'd see, like, UGC stuff with flip cameras and a bunch of different stuff, but it was really producers bringing those cameras in, feeding them, like, talking.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:06
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:15
Because nobody knew how to do it. Nobody had… there weren't, like, really great cameras on phones yet or anything, so all this stuff was engineered, and they had all the same pieces of paper to sign that, like, an actor would sign.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:17
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:26
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:27
Um, of, like, you know you're being recorded, you know you're not… you're only getting this $100 fee, blah blah blah blah blah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:33
Um, and it was, yeah, it was, like, really hyper-produced, but the first generation of UGC, everybody's like, this is just totally normal, people are just recording videos and sending them to companies. And it's like, no one's doing that!

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:43
Literally, no one's doing that. Everything is being artificially generated.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:45
Right. Yeah. No, it is funny. All games get gamed.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:52
In the end.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:52
Yeah. Yeah. Um… So, yeah, I mean, I would… I think… I think the hook and, like, how you generate the hook is something that I would personally explore.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:06
In the immediate short term. Of, um, what can I do Because you already had a big list of ideas, but, like, if you want to talk about Like, the ideas are not the hard part.

[Charlie Deist] 13:40:07
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:19
You would… you and I would be able to spitball a billion ideas in 10 seconds of, like, you know, the snack ideas are a great one, right?

[Charlie Deist] 13:40:19
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:26
Best mom tip and trick, grade one, right? Five problems with, uh, public school education. These are, you know, we do this all day.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:34
The problem is that first 2 or 3 second hook. And… you don't have to solve it. Like, the podcast community basically doesn't solve it. They just assume, I'm gonna be ingenious every single time.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:49
Right? So, like, the beginning of every podcast clip that we see, whether it's Tom Segur, Joe Rogan, or whoever else, Diary of a CEO, that first line is just from the podcast, and every week, they get really lucky that somebody said something that queued up a perfect piece of short-form content.

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:06
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:06
You can do it that way, or you could say, I'm gonna build a device, like a guy described last time, when he's got the phone, and he's like, come here.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:15
Like, he built a device that he can rely on for anything, whether it's a brand deal, or something he wants to tell you.

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:21
What's up, guys? Account's name? Did you know?

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:23
I can find them, let me find them for you, um… TikTok guy… that… So it's come here.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:32
There he is. Uh, Jordan The Stallion?

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:33
Okay, I think I found him. Jordan. Okay, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:40
So he… and that, obviously, he didn't figure that out on his first video, but he figured it out now, and now he can… couch, anything in that.

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:44
Right, right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:50
Yeah, right, right, right. Huh.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:52
And… and now that, I would say, to be fair, that is a high fucking bar. That is a, like, if I… I don't have one of these.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:58
Like, this is… this is great. My best is the… hey, can I take your photo? But I can't put anything behind that. He could put anything behind this, because it's… the whole idea is, like, let me give you information. It's like, I'm listening to whatever this guy says. Sometimes it's recipe.

[Charlie Deist] 13:42:05
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:12
Sometimes it's a brand deal, sometimes it's his opinion on something.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:17
Um. But that's really kind of what you're hunting for.

[Charlie Deist] 13:42:19
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:21
Unless you want to toss the cards up into the air every time and say, I'm just going to get really good at knowing and feeling what a good, sexy hook is.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:30
And I'm gonna find it organically out of pieces of content that come my way.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:33
And that's not… That's not a bad approach, it's just harder.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:41
Or it's… it's less dependable. Maybe it's not… maybe it's not harder. Maybe it's like, well, I just can't… I mean, I didn't get anything good this week, man.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:51
Like, there's nothing… They talked really in-depth about a lot of things, but I don't know, really sexy looks.

[Charlie Deist] 13:42:55
Right, right, right. Now, that's kind of how I'm feeling about the next several podcast episodes.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:00
There's nothing that good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:02
Well, we… I mean, if you want to review those, do you want to review those on Monday or something, and see… Um, and see what we can implant into the upcoming episodes, like, hey, can you guys say this or talk about this?

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:05
Yeah, let's do that, let's do that. That'll be good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:17
That might be helpful.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:17
Yeah. No, it sounds good, and just maybe go over a few more of the podcasts that have already been recorded.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:24
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:24
And I'll come with a lot of… different pieces of source material that we might take as the… the jumping-off point.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:34
Great. Great.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:37
Alright, sounds good. What have you got going on this weekend?

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:40
Alright, dude. Um, well, it… The weather for the last couple weeks has been my touch-and-go, where it's like, every day it says on the calendar it's gonna rain, but then it rains for, like, an hour, but it's always exactly when I shoot.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:49
Oh, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:53
Which has this problem of, even if it's not actually raining.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:57
All I need is somebody to be scared that it's gonna rain, and then they don't go out in the street looking cool.

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:02
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:02
And it's like, shit. So, like, right now, it's raining, and it's like, damn it, I'm gonna… supposed to be out there in about an hour.

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:08
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:09
And, um, I don't know what to expect, so… I might be rained out, and if I'm rained out, I think I would just make more long-term long-form YouTube videos?

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:19
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:19
Oh, that's… that's really… that's really what I got going on this weekend. Um… just trying to keep on keeping on. I'm going back and forth about… I'll talk to your off about this.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:30
These… the Ray-Ban glasses versus the hat camera that I use. And because the Ray-Bans are perfect in every way, except they don't shoot 16x9 landscape video for TVs, for YouTube, right?

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:34
Huh.

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:43
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:43
So if you record something great on there, you have to kind of encapsulate it with a frame of some kind, or a background. You've seen, you know, they'll… the background is blown up and blurry and, you know, like So I can either do that, or I can shoot on these hat cameras that do shoot 16x9, but I have all kinds of problems.

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:48
Right. Yep. Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:01
They have a short battery, they have these connectivity issues, the audio's not as good, like, really not as good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:08
And… I… I felt that when I'm wearing the hat camera, I'm concentrating too much on the gear, and I'm missing I'm, like, not present enough.

[Charlie Deist] 13:45:18
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:19
And all for long-form… the opportunity for long-form YouTube? I don't know. I'm going back and forth about this, that, like, I made this video, too, like, asking Mark Zuckerberg to make a 16x9 version of these glasses.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:32
But I haven't published either, like, I don't know what to do.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:35
With that, and um… I don't know, keep going back and forth.

[Charlie Deist] 13:45:41
I'll be curious to see that Mark Zuckerberg video when it… when you post it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:44
Yeah, I have a long-form version right now, and I'm like, I should just make a short one that is just me begging them for it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:45:49
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:52
Um, I'd kill. I'd kill for a version that shoots either… that you could just switch, you know, like… Um, because there's plenty of video cameras that shoot It's called OpenGate, but that shoots the whole sensor, and then you can decide after the fact, do I want this, or do I want this?

[Charlie Deist] 13:46:04
Oh, interesting. Huh, I've always wondered about that, because, like, where do those lines come from? Like, that's not the way the lenses work, right?

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:09
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:14
No, it's the… so you… so often, it's the sensor size, right? So the sensor is this way, right? And that's why you'll see people turn a camera like that and snap a photo sideways, because the sensor's actually long.

[Charlie Deist] 13:46:17
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:26
And when you want to get a portrait, you just rotate the camera.

[Charlie Deist] 13:46:28
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:30
Action cameras recently have had larger sensors, and they don't use the whole thing so they can move around the image and stabilize it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:46:38
Huh, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:40
If they were to apply that idea to the glasses, then they… you'd be able to do the same thing, where I could just get a censure punch, it's called.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:49
Um, and uh… it's got… I mean, I'm not

June 20 (1)

Summary

This meeting focused on developing a content strategy for podcasts with emphasis on generating shareable short-form video clips to build audience on social media platforms.

### Content Strategy Overview

The central audience-building approach involves creating "fire clips" that algorithms will serve to wider audiences. Effective content includes rants, soundbites, emotional moments, and polarizing statements (within comfortable boundaries). A standard operating procedure will include brainstorming YouTube titles and thumbnails before recording episodes.

- Described as a "firebrand" in the school choice debate
- Potentially controversial due to positions on teachers unions and political affiliations
- Has 211,000 followers on X, presenting an opportunity for increased visibility
- Need to steer conversation away from explicitly political framing while still addressing educational issues

**Daryl Stinson**

- Mental health for high performers
- TED speaker focusing on anxiety and depression
- Opportunity for hooks around what separates top performers from others

### Content Creation Approach

The team discussed creating templates and frameworks for podcast hosts, including:

- Potential hooks and questions that generate compelling soundbites
- YouTube title and thumbnail combinations that attract viewers
- Ways to frame conversations that align with the podcast's identity
- Using tools like Windsurf to organize content planning

### Action Items

- [ ]  Create a document with talking points for hosts before the DeAngelis interview
- [ ]  Develop hooks and questions for Stinson about high performance (e.g., "What separates the top 1% of performers?")
- [ ]  Generate YouTube title and thumbnail ideas for upcoming episodes
- [ ]  Share the Open Ed identity framework to help hosts navigate potentially controversial topics
- [ ]  Prepare visually compelling moments for thumbnails (like Stinson holding up one finger for "the one thing")

separate from the zoom call. Okay, we're good on that front. But yeah, I gave I gave some preliminary instructions to all the podcast hosts. And I can share what I told you, and we can use that as kind of the jumping off point. Yeah. I told them, let's see, I created this Slack channel.

Okay.

Big one is thinking about each episode largely as an opportunity to generate fire clips. This is central to my audience building strategy on the short form video platforms. These platforms will serve up our content to a wider audience algorithmically if we serve them the best content on a topic.

In our case, homeschooling, personalized learning, etc. Could be broader than this. But what works? Rants, soundbites, emotion, polarizing statements. I meant to say within the boundaries, but I said without the boundaries of what you feel comfortable with. I should probably correct that. Same goes for your guests, although I'll leave it up to you whether how you communicate that to them. Another practice I want to build into our standard operating procedures is to brainstorm one to three YouTube titles and thumbnails before we record the episode.

And I never followed up on this but for example practical how-tos with a certain number of pieces of advice not meant to constrain but Anyway, so that's yeah, that's what I told them Okay, great. So do you have a sense, do you know what podcast is coming up next? Yeah, I should. And who's on it? Yeah, I've got a calendar.

for that. Let's see Open Ed podcast. I think take all these off and now. Okay, so like, here's a good example. This is kind of funny. This is kind of, uh, I'm realizing you actually, do you know, Corey, do you know who this is by any chance? Corey DeAngelis. You guys have a bit of a, an uncanny resemblance.

Oh, that's funny. I'm always still looking at your Slack screen. Oh, okay. Okay. Hold on a second. This is sort of funny. I'm just realizing that you guys kind of look alike. I know that it can be a weird thing when people say you look like someone and you're like, I look nothing like that guy, but yeah.

No, I, uh, I'm not familiar. This is the guy who's next time. Okay. And so, and he is a, he's a real, um, firebrand, like his, his recent book. I think it had a blurb from Donald Trump, and he's gotten into the school choice debate and really stirred the pot. He's kind of a controversial figure because he really has taken on the teachers unions head-on.

And this is kind of a tricky one for us because we try to sort of steer clear of the politics of the school choice debate. And he's like right in the thick of that. Very much like a kind of libertarian, conservative influencer. Yeah. So do you guys have like.

Any kind of talking points already around this episode? Is there any like collateral that already exists that your hosts would go off of? That's a good question. Let me check what I've been trying to set up, although no one is... taking me up on it yet. I want it so that when the guest books, they give us like, all of that, like what they want us to specifically talk about.

In this case, I would say his most recent book, I don't know if that's going to be the topic. For this one really quick.

Any more details on that? I don't think that I have a whole lot of context. I mean, I can kind of tell you what the contour is of it. are going to be probably.

I mean, it's like the rise of the rise of educational choice.

kind of the sudden shift in opinion, I would guess, from like where 10 years ago This was still like a fairly fringe libertarian position to now where, you know, every other state has passed some kind of education savings account. Is that what you mean by collateral? Or do you mean more so? Yeah, I mean, well, I guess like, I wonder if I didn't know if there was like a central document or any document that like, say, the host would

Here's some questions or here's some topics or even the structure of the show, or are they literally just winging it? That's a good question. Yeah, I think... Actually, let me check one other there's one other channel where there's been some conversation recently. Hold on one second.

This got put on the, we have like an intern who's now managing A lot of these podcasts and I'm glad you asked about this because we do we need to get one of these to the host beforehand. And I don't think so. So I don't think I think we're kind of building it from scratch.

Got it. OK, just trying to get myself up to speed here on.

like there was a the the link that led well no that doesn't really

Yeah, what I would probably do is like I would send him a series of articles like a kind of a book summary, certain highlights of particularly snappy lines or like things that kind of align with with the open education message, ways for him to sort of steer things onto a less controversial track. Yeah.

I shouldn't say less controversial because it's still like we can be radical on this podcast. We just want to take it a little bit out of the framing of public versus Public versus private or like public versus homeschool sort of got it. Yeah.

Kind of think of like...

Just even questions to queue up his take.

It, you know, the first thing that comes to mind is like,

The number one thing wrong with public schooling, or American school systems, or something like that. Right, right. That might be, you know, that's a good soundbite. And I'm assuming this guy can deliver, given his pedigree. For sure. For sure. Yeah. Like, we don't really want to, I don't know, we don't want to get too much into teachers' unions, probably, I don't think. Okay. And the political stuff holds no value, right?

That's just.

Yeah, I mean, we kind of we picked a we picked a difficult one as the test case, which maybe is a good thing. Because it's also a lot more upside. Like if he, you know, he's got 211,000 followers on on X and we're really trying to like I've been trying to kind of get a little bit more attention on X for a long time so I'm going to want to push this in a way that he'll be proud to promote it. And Randy Weingarten happens to be

In the news right now, she's she was the president of the teachers union. And I guess she got like, I think she got like kicked out of the Democratic Party or something. Future of the Department of Education, like we could do something around that. The future of the Department of Education and the school choice movement, he's

But I think I, I think I sort of already see where you're angling. Is the parent revolution his? Okay, because the parent revolution is an interesting idea.

You know, that's the name of his book, but an audience on social media might not know that.

The parent revolution is here, you know, or the parent revolution has started and then like that, you know, then a soundbite of like what he believes that even is, and I'm sure he's got that on lock given his book. Right, like what does that even mean in two sentences. Right, right. And it's funny because now I'm remembering that I think I did.

create some notes on this a while back because I read this book. It'll be easy for me to come up with these. Um, the takeaway is I'm just trying to see if I can find that document anywhere. Maybe I don't have it.

Um, let's see, do you want to, do you want to keep on digging into this one? Or could we maybe take another example of another guest on the podcast? Yeah, we, yeah, we can take, we can take another, we can take another. Alright, next one is Daryl Stinson, and again I'm gonna have to kind of check out...

What has been said so far, not a whole lot. Daryl Stinson. I'm gonna, let me just share my whole screen here. Am I sharing? No, I'm not sharing the whole screen. No, no.

Okay, so here's Daryl Stinson, mental health for high performers. So he's kind of in a different vertical. He's not He's like a Ted Ted speaker that, yeah.

I don't exactly know what the angle is going to be for this one yet. Anxiety and depression. Well, but you know, I think, I think we, as the, let's call it storyteller, or at least producer of it, We're in the same boat as the audience. Why is this guy valuable? And just off the surface, the idea that he's about.

the number one thing you should do to level up your performance. It's questions like that.

What's the big red flag that you notice in someone that indicates they're not a high performer? You know, it's those type of things. And then you can imagine...

The video title being something like...

All, all high performers do this one thing. And then if you're lucky, maybe you get a video clip of him in the podcast, where he's holding up one finger, you know, right, right. So in that you can imagine, like the kind of assets we're trying to get, but let's say we spitball that and we have like a

half page document of like, here's a couple cues of like, hit him with these questions, right? And then even in this case, we'd love this image of him being like one. And then that's a thumbnail, and we might generate some other ideas like maybe let's say he's got a book let's say the other guy.

They're not nouns, but they're like bullet points of things. Let's get all this stuff tangibly. Right, right. Yeah.

Okay, so this is just applying a lens to a topic.

Again, we're leaning on some of these formats. I think of them as frameworks, templates. And I've got my, you know, short list of.

YouTube title and thumbnail combinations now that kind of functions as a set of adjunct instructions. And so what I might do, like if we're imagining that I'm actually doing this, I won't hide the fact that I think that this is probably how I would approach it.

And by the way, this is a A new tool that I've been using in lieu of the traditional interface with the large language model. It's kind of like a layer on top, but this is Windsurf. You might have heard of like Cursor or Windsurf. They're pretty much the same apps, but they're designed for programmers and you've got like your code base over here normally.

a chat window that has agent mode or in Windsurf, it's called write mode, but it's like this kind of cascade thing where you can just, you can talk to it and it'll do the coding for you. It'll update your documents. Vibe coding. Vibe coding, exactly. So this is Vibe marketing here. And instead of my code, I've just got...

Folders with different projects and documents. So I've got my frameworks folder here, the podcast wizard, which has all my different things like the YouTube title and thumbnail framework that, that this is basically based on conversations that we've had in the past.

And I can just start a new. And I would say something like, okay, here's, um, context. That's a YouTube transcript of the parent revolution. And I'm just going to say, Corey DeAngelis is going to be a guest on the open ed podcast. Uh, we're looking to design the title and sort of stage some soundbites in the podcast and come up with,

A list of ideas for the host and guest to have at the top of their mind. And then I'll tag the YouTube title and thumbnail framework. This document contains sort of the formulas for YouTube titles. And then I'm also going to tag the OpenEd identity document. Let's see. Identity framework. This document contains the perspective of OpenEd. A few of the landmines we want to watch out for are getting too explicitly political or anti-political.

But it's still fair game to speak more broadly about, you know, the problems with traditional school. So now let's kind of refresh like what were what were some of your suggestions earlier? Um, the number one or like the, what was it? Uh, yeah, I mean, like, I think I spit balled some stuff like, um, you know, what's the one red flag that you would notice in anybody indicating they're not a high performer.

But I just did something similar in chat GPT, but it's something really basic, like, give me 10 give me 10 hooks to ask a high performance coach on a podcast. Yeah. And from that I got I got 10 solid ones here. I can drop them in the chat. Yeah, go for it.

And that's for the, that's for Daryl Stinson. I want to come, I'm going to come back to. There you go. I mean, like, you know, what separates the top 1% of performers from everybody else? And can it actually be taught? So, like, I think at least the first half of that is probably a solid short-form hook-on. Right, right, right. Is high performance about mindset, habits, or environment?

And so you can imagine a hook there being something like high performance is about this one thing, right? What's something most people would be shocked to learn about high about elite performers. Right. Let's say someone wants to radically level up in 90 days what step one, what's the one thing you should do.

to level up in 90 days. Or level up in 90 days with this one trick, or this one tip. Right, right, right.

Summary

This meeting focused on optimizing podcast content for social media, particularly transforming long-form podcast episodes into shorter, more engaging clips for platforms like YouTube and Instagram.

### Content Repurposing Strategy

- Create shorter 6-8 minute clips from 30-40 minute podcast episodes to get "more bites at the apple"
- Consider extending some clips to 8+ minutes for YouTube algorithm optimization (additional ad breaks)
- For Instagram, shorter content generally performs better, but can flex up to 60 seconds when needed
- Implement a "list format" with visual numbering and sound effects for certain content types
- Try starting clips with the punchline rather than building up to it

### Podcast Episodes Discussion

- **Benton Crane Episode**: Focus on the George Washington story about his early military failures and comeback
    - Potential title: "From Screw-Up to Legend: George Washington's Biggest Failure"
    - Key angle: Most people don't know Washington made major mistakes early in his career
- **Marketing Clip**: "Why entertainers make better marketers"
    - Convert into a numbered list format with visual indicators
    - Key points: Marketing is mechanical, but entertainment is nuanced; today's audiences aren't captive
    - Connection to Harmon Brothers (Poo-Pourri campaign) could be leveraged
- **Katie Kimball Episode**: Focus on anxiety in kids and parenting approaches
    - Key insight: Helicopter parenting leads to anxiety when kids feel they lack agency
    - Second clip about letting kids fail with low stakes before giving them higher-risk responsibilities

### Title and Thumbnail Optimization

- Consider direct appeal titles: "If your kid hates school, please watch this"
- Test provocative angles: "George Washington was a screw-up"
- Use thumbnail text to create curiosity: "Break the rules" or "My best tips"
- Avoid assuming titles or thumbnails that don't work mean the content isn't good - test multiple versions
- Consider A/B testing different titles and thumbnails for the same content

### Social Media Collaboration Strategy

- Collaborations with experts like Coach Meg Thomas have boosted engagement
- Consider inviting more expert contributors to Open Ed Daily
- Explore more collaborative reels where Open Ed is listed as a collaborator or vice versa
- Ghostwriting articles for expert contributors who don't want to write themselves

### Action Items

- [ ]  Research examples of successful podcast clip screen text formats
- [ ]  Review on-screen caption size and formatting on mobile devices
- [ ]  Create and publish clips from the Benton Crane episode with optimized titles/thumbnails
- [ ]  Implement the list format for the comedians/marketers clip
- [ ]  Reorder the 6th grader's marketing pitch clip to start with the punchline
- [ ]  Skip the meeting on July 4th and potentially reschedule for Thursday

Transcript

with like every brand on the planet, like if you're making a new movie, like the characters are in Fortnite. So it's Instead of making a movie about the video game, movies and pop culture come to Fortnite and be like, can you include our characters? Sabrina Carpenter's in it, the new Superman is in it, Transformers, Star Wars was last season.

Anything that's anything and it's a weird mix, right? There's the really the only holdouts that I can think of are like Nintendo. But everybody else is in there. Yeah, it's funny because it's almost like turning the game into a platform. Thinking about how that's the buzzword for, you know, every company wants to be a platform company. And I think the same is true of Open Ed where we're trying to find ways. And one of the things that has just come about in the last week.

I know that part of the marketing team's strategy for the next, well, just going forward, I guess, is going to be kind of like inviting more contributions. from other sort of well-known people on their topics of expertise, so they'll be a contributor to the Open Ed Daily. And in the case where they don't necessarily want to have to write the article, I'm going to be doing the ghostwriting for them.

Which I that's my bread and butter and like I'm super comfortable in that zone, but it's just sort of it's occurring to me now and also with the podcast, which I think that's our agenda for today is to kind of go over some of these upcoming podcast episodes.

I think, you know, we you've already talked about how we want to try to. prepare the host and guests to deliver the right content for the clip strategy. But I almost wonder if there could even be, this is probably overcomplicating it, to try to branch out into other, you know, like collaborative real formats. But for, for one thing, I think that that's, you know, there are a lot of

We have gotten a lot of traction with Coach Meg Thomas when she signs on as a collaborator on one of our Instagram posts. That is an instant boost for us. We might think about how we could do more of those kinds of things. and maybe kind of partner on a short form reel where we list them as a collaborator or vice versa.

I don't know. I mean, I think collaborations could be really powerful, especially if your collaborator has an audience. Right. Right. Yeah. It's it. It can definitely be a signal boost because you're going to get in front of a a sizable portion of their audience, particularly if the video is any good. Right, right. I think, you know, if you get to that point, I think we could talk through some of the technicalities of.

how that collaborator system works on Instagram, because there's been a couple things that I've learned over time that have helped. So we can chat that through if necessary. Cool. Perfect. All right. Well, then you want to kind of dive into the podcast or anything else? Yeah. Yeah. No, I thought I thought the podcast stuff would be great to get into just kind of see.

What you've got on what you've got available what we can turn into content now and then also what we can plan for the future right like what can we set up for the other things I was looking at your YouTube stuff and it struck me that Your YouTube videos are all 30 to 40 minutes, let's say, right? And that inside of every YouTube video that is 30 or 40 minutes, there's probably.

a handful of six or seven minute moments, right? You know, when you see, you see this in the comedian podcast world already, right? But like, and it struck me that, wow, you know what, you might be able to get more bites at the apple by by doing what you're doing.

But also Making you know, find a nice three to eight minutes total in every part and a handful of those and then and then you get another bite at the apple for another sexy thumbnail and title. And the worst case is that you get more data for like, what are people interested in? Oh, every time I talk about this shock title, it works, or whatever. That's the worst case. The best case is that, you know, this strategy may actually work, that like instead of deploying once a week or whatever it is, I can now deploy five times a week.

Totally. Totally. Yeah. And so, I mean, I just post the full podcast on YouTube and Spotify. Spotify also has some kind of clips feature. I don't really know what that's optimized for. Like, I wouldn't want to post the six to eight minute ones as episodes in addition to, but just focused on YouTube.

I like that idea a lot. And I think that I've got the bandwidth for it just because I see that, yeah, so many of our podcast episodes, the entire thing is kind of a snooze fest to listen to. Like, I don't even listen to them. Um, but, uh, there's oftentimes really solid six minute clips. Uh, yeah. And I think, you know, it's, it gives you another leg in that stool that a podcast is now giving you even more content. You're already getting the short form stuff, which we're working on.

You're obviously getting a long form, but then there's kind of this middle of, you know, you can find a great five minutes, maybe find multiple. And it kind of gets back to that core of Searching for what works in terms of thumbnail and title combo, and that'll just give you more bites at the Apple. Yeah, for sure. Let me just see one thing. Okay, good. My.

My VA did cut this one because this is the one, basically my status right now, I'm like technically on paternity leave and I'm kind of taking the opportunity of having the decks cleared and I'm not going to be responsible for so many dailies this month.

I'm just going to sort of focus on the short form, the reels, kind of tightening everything up and then gearing up to restart the daily come August. And in a sort of leaner format, all that. So now is like a great time to be kind of implementing some of these changes. This is, I'm still going to be posting a podcast, one podcast episode per week. So I'm hoping that I can basically schedule like bulk process.

We can get through as many episodes. But basically I think, you know, we should be looking at title and thumbnail. Clips and captions in particular, on-screen captions, and then if there's time we could also kind of get into like the text portion of the caption. My working assumption has been that the sort of, you know, the opening hook in the script itself and the on-screen are...

90% of what's determining whether somebody sticks around, with the supporting text being mostly for the algorithm. You're talking about the description copy? Yeah, the description copy. Right, yeah. Yep. Yes, I agree with that. Okay. Yes, that's yeah, you're right All right, cool. And then actually for this one maybe we'll spend the most time on this just because it's the timeliest and we could even see what what a You know three to eight minute clip from this would look like not necessarily cutting the whole thing, but just looking at from a transcript perspective because this episode was

little bit all over the map or like there were there were two or three very distinct beats. So I can imagine you know some of those beats being good to To convert, um, but yeah, so basically we've got, uh, the, the calendar for the podcast. This is my calendar. So if I'm going to release one every Thursday, I've got episodes in the queue, uh, through August 7th. And are those already shot? How many of these are shot?

They're all shot. They're all shot. Okay. So yeah, we're just what we've what we've got is what we've got, we'll make the most of it. And if there's not any good clips, like if we look at one, and we're just kind of like, that one kind of like, Doesn't leave me feeling anything. Then I would say, let's just cut it. Let's just like not, not even really bother trying to polish turd. Okay.

So, starting with Benton Crane, the background on this one, he's, we have, for some reason we seem to have a lot of people from kind of like the filmmaking, entertainment world speaking about, this guy in particular, he's connected with Angel Studios, which I think is a Mormon company.

They created The Chosen. Actually, I'm not sure if they're, it doesn't matter, but, but our founder kind of has these random connections to people in the, in the LDS or Mormon world. Um, so that this guy is like a producer of the movie young George Washington that comes out on July 4th.

Um, and what else do they talk about? They talk about, yeah. Okay. Young George Washington. They talk about kind of how you don't really need permission anymore to go out and make a movie. Actually, that's something that you've kind of talked about just how like.

The whole industry has changed. I think with this one, with the title, I'm trying to sort of balance like relevance to our audience and the topic. with sort of keywords and different things like that. We can start with the clips so you get a sense of the flavor of the episode before going to the title.

Or we could start with the title and kind of back out what are the best clips, but I think. Yeah, I mean, I think let's take a listen and kind of get a sense of what. Some of this is like, do you have some moments queued up? Yeah, I do. You want to do? Okay, great. Because I say we listen and then kind of let that inform what we're gonna do. But before I forget, you mentioning the fact that it's

This is at least tangentially related to an upcoming movie release. That's another thing that I would leverage. I just assume that they are going to do some kind of marketing. And there may be a way of piggybacking on that. Right. Right. Right. So if it's using the poster for a thumbnail or.

You know, like whatever it is, whatever ways that you can kind of leverage, you know, think about this like a press junket and like, how would you get in front of that? That's the kind of stuff where it's like, you know, let me see where I can suck up audience and assuming.

Do you have any reservations with playing towards his audience in the short term? Okay. So assuming that's not an issue, then like rock and roll, then I would say See what these people are already going to be searching for and then you can kind of like lay in the cut. Okay. You know, you're kind of a part of that media machine. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny because this movie, I would have assumed...

That it's going to be sort of a, I thought it was coming out on July 4th. That was everything I was told. Yeah. And here's an article talking about, but there's like, I can't even find the movie poster. So it might be, I don't know, sort of a B-level movie, but we'll figure that out. At least there's this, so there's something. Yeah. Okay, let's check it out. Okay. Where were we? Here we go. Nope, that's not it.

Descript.

I'll just find it in here. Benton Crane

And the first clip, um, let's go with the George Washington one, the failure that created a legend. And I actually haven't even, I wrote these, but I haven't watched them since my edit since my VA. George Washington, before he became president, before he became general as a young military officer out to tell the French to leave and the interaction goes horribly wrong.

It's on 1.5 speed. Let me slow that down.

George Washington, before he became president, before he became general, has a young military officer out to tell the French to leave. And the interaction goes horribly wrong. George screws up in the worst possible ways and accidentally sets off a global war.

Massive blunder. career-destroying type mistakes here, and this is a story about how George goes from hitting rock bottom and making the worst possible mistakes to turning that around in this character-defining moment where he ends up in a battle, and General Braddock is killed, and things are going terribly wrong.

And George needs to lead an evacuation. He ends up with three bullet holes in his coat and a couple more in his hat. But he goes unscathed. He gets the troops together, executes a successful retreat, saves hundreds of lives, proves his bravery, his valor.

This is the beginning of the legendary George Washington. That's cool. That's a cool story.

Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I would have anything to cut from that. I mean, like, I think it's, it's set up really well. It is kind of a tease, you know, to more of his adventures, let's call it, right? I didn't know that. My initial reaction was, oh my dad would love this shit out of this too from a demo point of view. 40 plus year old men, you know, love history, you know, you age into loving the history channel. And I wonder about women. Right, right.

But. It's hard to argue with this clip. It's just like, who is it for would be a question, but it's good. And it's like this. Could be an example of, you know, this is what it looks like to shotgun. This is what it looks like to throw noodles at the wall.

We're like, I'm trying to find hits everywhere. And this might resonate with an audience we didn't expect. Or women may, who even knows? But I like that. I'm not sure I would change that. I mean, I think it is what it is. Like it's a it's I think it's the best version of what one could think wouldn't benefit from

Rearranging stuff or putting things earlier. No, I mean, that was really it was all really well put. I mean, there are a couple of words in there that you can say. Well, you don't need to. Yeah, I can smooth it out a little bit. Like the one I noticed was massive blunder career destroying type mistakes. Like I would, you could take a type, you know, like, but on the other hand, that just saves you, you know, like less than a second, I'm not sure.

I don't know. I think that's pretty clear.

Yeah, the caption, this actually wasn't the caption that I had originally come up with. I had come up with, he started a global war, like George Washington started a global war at 22, something, I don't know. That's not yet. No, that's good. Well, I think the most shocking part is like that second graph there, right? Where he's like, George Washington screwed up. It's like, oh, shit. What? Like.

George Washington was a screw-up as a headline. That is interesting that I didn't know. Yeah. And I'm just assuming it's true. Like this is, you know, like I would watch this technology and I'd be like, Holy shit, I never I know. And I take it all the way to the bank. This sounds totally legit. Yeah.

So, um, that's an angle. Um, let's go with it. Let's go with it. I would say we could keep brainstorming, but, but I'd rather kind of get more, um, More volume in this session than affecting any individual, but I think that's a good one. I like that. One last thing. I know how much you like those illustrated...

old timey images, right, that you've shown a few times. This may be a good example of if you had enough of them, right, to kind of make a montage as he's talking to kind of make it a little bit more interesting. Okay, now, you don't need to do it, you could do both, publish this one, and then do that one on the side and publish that one in two weeks or something right, like

No one will know, you know, and it's just this is a great example of how maybe you could use that this is perfect for that style. I like that.

Because I think it'll be good. So these other two are completely different topics. This one I thought was kind of interesting. It's really not that hard to train a marketer, but it's really hard to train an entertainer. And so we actually found we would go out and we would hire comedians.

improv comedians or stand-up comedians. Marketing is actually not that hard. You provide value, you present the problem, you show a solution, you build some credibility, you overcome some concerns, you have a call to action. It's almost mechanical. It's almost you're following a recipe.

But the entertainment side of it, that is much more nuanced.

There's so much of that that's good. This guy's really good. Like he understands how to set up a story. Assuming this is in order. Assuming you didn't reorder this. No, I don't think so. It would be interesting. Is there any more there as to why comedians do that better? Right, right. That's the question. And I can look in the transcript.

That's what I was thinking the same thing, that it just needs like a little bit more. And I'm not sure that marketing... You know, I could teach somebody marketing, but I can't teach somebody how to be an entertainer. Right, right. And it's like, okay, so why is that? Why is the entertainment part valuable? Yeah, yeah.

But like if we wanted to expand on this clip with a little bit more content, what were you just saying? I would say, I think that it'd be interesting to understand why entertainment has value because the premise of this clip is That you could teach anybody marketing, but you can't teach everybody entertainment. And it's like, okay, so what is the value in entertainment? And so it would be great if this ended in a way that said.

You know, this is why comedians are particularly well suited as marketers. Right, right. Something about why entertainers are particularly well. suited as marketers. This will just help us kind of dig up like some other material that we might be able to copy and paste.

See, okay, so here's the setup. If you think back to the 1990s and before advertisers kind of thought of their audience as captive and it's like, Oh, you know, my audience is there. They're not going anywhere. They're kind of stuck. So I'm kind of forced.

So I'm just going to kind of force feed them. Well, that's not the world we live in today. Whether it's a skip button on YouTube or just scroll right past on Facebook or Instagram, you have to earn people's attention. They're not captive. And the way I do that is I have to entertain them.

I have to make them smile. I have to make them laugh. I have to provide value. That sounds good. That sounds like that's headed in the right direction. Just to explain why entertainers are particularly well suited. Well, and this one could be, if it's too long for a short clip, we could try turning this one into a longer segment where maybe it even has a little bit more of the back and forth between him and Isaac.

Yeah, I mean, you can definitely flex up to 60 seconds on Instagram. Okay, I don't, I don't do it because I don't even kind of have the content that lasts that long. It's the same thing. So it's like shorter is better. Right? But if you've got a you know, 60 seconds is still totally plausible. I don't want to shy you away from that. It's just not something that I generally have the guts to do. But you have a lot of

You have a lot of material here. Yeah. Okay. So it's basically just, it's all this and then where does it end on faces? Put a smile on your on your face, but it was all after that.

Yeah, so I'll just I can paste this to this composition and now. It adds it in here. So now we're up to well now we're up to two minutes and 30 seconds, but there's probably a lot that I can cut in here. So I'll hold off on actually making those edits because that would take a full like 15 minutes probably or 10 minutes.

But I like that. I think that's a good fix. Any thoughts on the. The captions are on screen. Why comedians are the best marketers.

That's not bad.

I don't, I, depending on what he says, you know, when I was looking through your Instagram earlier today, I was thinking to myself, boy, I sure would love to see some lists in here. You know, like five reasons comedians are the best marketers. And you don't even need them to necessarily set it up. But you can, if there are five reasons or three reasons, you could say three reasons and then.

Put a one on the screen, put a two on the screen, put a three on the screen as he's going through different points. You know, comedians are very good at entertaining one, they make people laugh too. Like, you could just for the hook for like, I'm waiting for the three. I'm waiting for the three reasons. Um, that could be another thing. Yeah.

OK, I'll think about that. I'll think about one whether I'd have the bandwidth to do the edit there, because that could be good. I mean, I wonder. If we were to just pitch it to Claude and see like, okay, so this is the script.

Is there a way to turn this to turn the caption into something like five reason why entertainers make the best marketers where we do a little ding sound effect with the number on the screen every time he mentioned something? Um, the only edits that we can make are deleting and rearranging. You can't add in any new words, keep the script intact.

That last part is just to make sure that it doesn't hallucinate. Working material that we don't have to work with. They're harder to train than marketers. Marketing is mechanical. Entertainment is nuanced. Today's audience isn't captive. Fun comes first. Entertainment earns attention.

Well, but wait, I guess, I guess we could do that. Like, like these are just, these would be captions that come on the screen each time it does a little ding. I'm going to try to pitch this to my VA and see if she can see if she can turn this around. Yeah, I mean, it's just a list format. The list format could be really powerful if you're just delivering info.

Right, right.

Yeah, I think that's good. I mean, this, this could also be like a, this is a great piece of content for other platforms, including the newsletter too. So here's what it would look like. It would be like, it's really not that hard to train them. Train a marketer. Was that the first line? Yeah, but it's really hard to train an entertainer. So, well, wait, I guess we'd have to, it would have to. Yeah, I'm not sure why that's good.

That's the only one that. You know, five reasons why entertainers make the best marketers. I'm not sure that first one supports that premise. Right, right, right. But otherwise... That would have to be...

Is this right? They're harder to train than, yeah, I see. Cause it, no, that, that's not, cause I'd have to, I'd have to tinker with that a little, but I'm going to, it could be, yeah. You can also do three. Right, right, right. Three reasons, right? Like...

We have three reasons and the first one as you have it is not really a reason and the first couple of seconds of the video need to set up with the main on-screen title card at the beginning. So get rid of that first one and then pick the other one that's the weakest and rewrite the script.

and include the captions with each ding as it goes through the video.

So here we go. It's really not that hard to train a marketer, but it's really hard to train an entertainer. So we actually found we would go out, our comedians, improv comedians or stand-up comedians, Show 1. Marketing is mechanical. Entertainment is nuanced. Marketing is actually not that hard. You provide value. You have call to action. It's almost mechanical. It's almost you're following a recipe, but the entertainment of it. And then 2.

Audiences aren't captive anymore. Um, whether it's a good one or YouTube or on YouTube, or just a score right past on Facebook and Instagram, you have to earn people's attention because We could almost do like in the in the intro three reasons why entertainers make the best marketers from the creator of the Pooh Paree campaign or something like that because everybody knows.

Everybody knows that ad campaign. Yeah. He did poopery. I guess so. Harmon brothers. Yeah. Or maybe. Interesting. Maybe, maybe he didn't specifically, but his, the, the agency that he. That's very cool. Yeah, yeah. All right, cool. I think I've got and you know something just to mention this.

It's plausible to make the same video three times and just change the caption and space them out. And try to see which one works better, right? Like I wouldn't give up on a post that you feel is good. Cause like maybe the hook was wrong or like maybe the, that caption was wrong.

Try it again like from the maker of the Pooh Paree marketing campaign. Yeah, somehow I think maybe this reveals a character flaw in me or some kind of way that I'm looking at this whole process wrong. But like to me, when I think about, it's a bit like, you know, hiking back on the same trail that you went out or something. For me, the thought of coming back to an old clip and remaking it.

It's kind of like, let's just move on to the next thing. Let's just, you know, keep moving forward. But do you think there really is some value in that? I really do, because I think you You discover that like, it isn't there could be 85% of what's working, but it's just the beginning part that that you need to fix. Yeah. And if you can fix that, then they get the rest of it. When you see a video that has low view count.

It's not even really a testament to the creative, because they didn't watch it. If they watched it, then you would have a better position. If you have a shit ton of views, but the comments are filled with hate, Then you know you may possibly have shitty creative, or at least polarizing creative, right? But if you have like low views, it means nobody even watched it because the algo

The people just abandoned the video they swiped away likely your swipe away rates really really high. So people didn't even really watch the meat of it. It's really, you know, like it's like a restaurant with a bad sign. It's like, well, the restaurant might be great, but it's like change the sign and they may come in. Yeah, I don't know. When I, like, when I look back.

I don't know. I'm just scrolling back through Instagram and looking like, okay, what's one that has under 500 views? Um, I mean, sometimes like one of these, this one I think did better on YouTube for some reason, but, um, I, I would just kind of rather march towards.

Continuous improvement. I think I think it's not a either or I would say it would be an and that and it and it really does mean only if you think the creative is really Good, or it has proven successful somewhere else. I'll give you an example for me is my Ray Ban mirrors video on Instagram, it's going to hit a million views on on Tick Tock. It's got 600 views. And it's like, so what the fuck was that?

How is that possible? And I think I didn't put any hashtags on it because I thought I was being clever. And I think maybe I fucked that up. I think that maybe I I made a mistake. And it's also possible that Ray Ban and meta is a word that Tick Tock's like, no, you don't talk about Facebook on our platform. We don't care. Right. So it's like, Oh, okay, got it. Maybe it's that. But like something's going on because that video performed really, really well on Instagram and got a lot of comments.

It wasn't like meta just signal boosted because it's like one of our products. Like it gets I get comments every three minutes. Yeah, still. Yeah. So like something's up and it struck it struck me. It's got to be my fault, right? It's got to be something I did. You know, it could be posting time, it could be lack of description and captions, whatever.

But and I do that I have a handful of videos that have like performed really, really well somewhere. And I'll try them again elsewhere. with like micro tweaks, usually in the set of text. Right, right. Okay, I'll consider that. But only if you love it. Don't do it because you feel like, now, shit, now I'm going back through all my stuff and trying everything again. No, no, no. Only if you're like, yo, this is a good video.

This is like a solid video. Yeah. Well, let's take a look at this is the third clip from this episode. Okay. And I'm looking at it and it doesn't really feel like

I put together this little pitch video where she was saying don't hire a middle-aged man from Google. That's creepy. Instead, hire me. You know, your kids will love it. So now she's done two or three of them, and I think it's kind of a tool set that she knows she can use to break through the noise and get to people when she needs to.

It's really effective. That's actually not bad. That's good. I think it's a shame that that great part comes in the middle after a lot of context. Like if somehow you could start the video with, my daughter says, don't hire a middle-aged. Man from Google, that's creepy. Hire me instead. Right, right. Yeah. Let me see. Did I give the full, let me give, let me just give the full transcript here and just see if there's a way to.

To rearrange this.

Where was it? It was this one.

I want to see if I can rework this clip to put the punchline about don't hire a middle-aged man from Google at the beginning. Is there more supporting context from the full transcript to where we could rearrange this again without adding anything in, only deleting and rearranging?

And then we can also just in one one prompt kind of see what some three to eight minute clips might look like.

Start with the punchline. Don't hire a middle-aged man from Google. That's creepy. Instead, hire me. You know, your kids will love it. That was actually the third pitch video that my daughter had done, her first pitch. So that could work. That was actually... Yeah.

...my daughter had done. Her first one was... Uh, let's see...

Okay, so there's some kind of discontinuity here the way that it did it, but I think it would work I think I don't think people would really remember Something like this.

It could be... Here's a few possibilities. This 6th grader's marketing pitch is genius. Yes, something like that. She's been closing deals since 6th grade. Yeah, I think the sixth graders marketing pitch is genius. My head was in daughters, but that's probably better. Okay.

Especially for you, especially for Open Ed. I've been wanting to try something. I don't know if this is going to work at all, but they have changed like. Actually, let me come over to the full thing here. I want to see, I don't think this is going to work, but like, can you create this clip? I'm going to see if Descript can actually stitch together.

I am fascinated by this. This is so alien to me. It's like I'm watching somebody in the future. Well, it didn't work. But soon enough, soon enough, I could say. You got the first part, but not the other parts.

Anyway, we won't get bogged down with that, but I like this a lot. I feel like we've taken all three of these clips to the next level. But I did want to see like, what would be some possible three to eight minute clips, do you think that's the sweet spot? Yeah, I think on YouTube if you can get above eight minutes like eight minutes ten seconds eight eight minutes is where the additional ad breaks are

So maybe like 8-12 or 8-15? hit eight minutes if you really have a two minute clip, I wouldn't do that. Okay. But if you can get to eight minutes, that means that it is the operating urban legend stuff around the algo on YouTube right now is that it can add more

Ad breaks, and so it will prioritize that video over, say, a two-minute. Right, right. Okay. Um, yeah, I mean, I think... There probably is. I'd like, let's look at these and then we can have it generate the script for one or two of them that we like the best. You may even... You know, have it suggest a thumbnail layout. Sure. Sure. Yep. Yep. Title and thumbnail.

And this, this thing here has a set of YouTube. Well, it's got actually, you know what, I need to update this project with, um, I have a new document for YouTube and thumbnails. This is my this is what's really blowing my mind recently is just the ID ease these these coding tools where

You have your code base over here. I've got folders with all my frameworks, and then I can call up the frameworks in this agent window over here, where it can just think through all kinds of tasks. I can pick which model I use. But I'm just- And what app is that?

What app is the one you're using? This is Windsurf. Windsurf. Cursor is probably the most famous. But there's new ones coming out. I think Cursor and Windsurf are really the two that have emerged at the front of the pack for serious developers. And now there's one Claude Code, which is used internally at Anthropic, the company that built Claude, that's also pretty powerful.

And that one just plugs directly into any terminal. I don't know. I'm not a programmer. learning the bare minimum that I need to know to get myself into trouble. But let's see. Okay, I'll just paste this. I'll say, okay, let's pick. Let's do the why entertainers make better marketers and the George Washington story as an extended clip. Make it as long as it can be without retaining any fluff and then also suggest a title and thumbnail combination or four or five title and thumbnail combinations for each video.

Reproduce the full script for each one and then write a short YouTube description.

okay so we've got we're just kind of rehashing the clip but it's going to be in longer form and I'm hoping it's going to have a little dialogue

Let's see.

I feel like this is going to end up being too short if it's not.

We're not captive. I mean, we had it at 2 and 1 1⁄2 minutes. Let's see.

Yes, they're effective as an ad, they sold a product, they earned money. But I think, do you agree that these would be better if we could have them as with like a little bit of dialogue and kind of frame them as

Like this one as a monologue just feels a little bit funny.

You mean with the host going back and forth? Yeah, or maybe not. Yeah, I mean, if possible. I mean, I don't...

I think it would just depend on, like, this guy seems particularly good. And I would have listened to his George Washington story for a while. I may be a version where it was cutting to some of that illustration I talked about. But I don't know. I mean, I think I've listened to podcast clips where it's one guy just going on a rant.

Yeah, OK.

I think, I think the purpose of an exercise like this though would be do every version like if there's a version where there's a rant if there's a version where there's back and forth. And then start to see what performs. Because right now it's really it isn't about like, hey, how do I get this one thing out the door that I know will work really well? It's like, well, what will work really well?

Maybe it's seven minute clips with that are much easier to digest. Yeah. So let's take a look at the title and thumbnail combinations. Cause with the actual selection itself, I'll play with that. I might do it with dialogue, but. Um, for the first one, why Harman brothers hired comedians over MBAs. I don't know if Harman brothers really has the name recognition that would agree in that situation, but marketing lessons from squatty potties, ad agency, CEO.

The $100 million marketing secret no one talks about. I don't really love that. That's, that's, oh, you don't? Oh, well, no, I, I don't know. I like the thumbnail here. Hire comedians, not marketers. I think, I mean, you get both of them, right? You get, I mean, if you.

You know, there's a certain type of person that clicks on 100 million marketing secret, right, right. And, and the, on one hand, my only criticism be that number seems so big. It's like, well, that's not I don't have those problems, right? Like, I don't need to worry about that. But I find myself clicking on Alex Hermosi stuff all the time. No, for sure. For sure. Mostly out of sick fascination, but it's in that universe.

I'm fascinated by Hermosi because on one hand I smell grifter, but the way his videos are constructed is so fascinating to me. You know, like he is, he's very casual. I can't, I don't get the impression he's reading off any kind of cue cards or any kind of, and it's just, but he's, you know, he'll go on a 48 minute tear.

Yeah. With all kinds of numbers and metrics. The only other time I've ever seen that happen in real life was with somebody who would make the numbers up. And it was like, you know, I used to, I was the creative director for this guy, this kind of co-duo CEO team.

And he would go into pitch meetings where we would pitch like major Hollywood studios to help. So we built this thing called 7-Eleven TV, which was a digital signage platform inside of all the 7-Elevens across the country, two big flat panel TVs, one above the register, one above the coffee station.

And we would sell ads to Pepsi and you know, and everybody and one of them was when Iron Man was coming out and he he looked people in the eye and was like, I just had a conversation with Robert Downey Jr. and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm looking at him like, that did not happen. That is absolutely not true. But every day, it was like, whatever it takes to close this deal.

And to his credit, unfortunately, that worked more often than it should have. And I remember a couple times being like, bro, laid low on some of this stuff. We're about to go into fucking Warner Brothers. They will know. They know these people better than you know them.

But, and so that's why with Hermosia, I'm always trying to like sniff it out, I was like, is it bullshit? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Seems like you'd have a lot more fact-checkers in the comments if it was total bullshit, but... Yeah, but some of the numbers are so inside baseball, like our business grew 27%...

You know, month over month, and we had X number of ROI. It's like, there's no fucking way you're coming off off the top of your head with this. Like not 48 minutes straight with no cuts. Like, I don't get it. Title, The 22-Year-Old Who Accidentally Started a World War, Young Washington Portrait, His Mistake Changed History. Do we want to get George Washington in the title or does it not necessarily matter if we've got him in the thumbnail?

Well, I do think given how important he is, I think that if you're not interested in George, you don't want to click on 22-year-old who accidentally started a war and then discovers George Washington. I don't think. You'd be like, wait, what? This is a George Washington story? You know, I thought I was clicking in on something. I don't know. There's some, that's clever. It's kind of a clever bait and switch.

Yeah, it strikes me as that. So that's an edgy idea. Maybe we put that one on the shelf and think on that. That's it's not a bad idea. But it is definitely like outside of the norm. Yeah, yeah. I would my instinct would be if you're going to talk about George Washington, show George Washington on the thumbnail. Right, right.

And also maybe imply something that you've never heard before, right? That he's a screw-up. Oh, that's and then I think I think we might want to just reuse that in the thumbnail like George Washington was a screw up or something, or, yeah, but but that's one idea you know and the other thing I was gonna say though is that like, um,

We know enough about George Washington that he had no career ending mistake. Right. So I think we do. We're playing inside the bounds of pop culture. But if you could fuck with that a little bit, if you could challenge your assumptions, that's where that could work.

Yeah. Like, if he died, you know, it's, it's what we love about the Thomas Jefferson stories that like, oh, he had slave kids. You know, like it runs counter to at least what used to be the pop cultural assumption of a guy like that. Right. I thought he was a saint. Yeah. Right. So it's that idea that maybe he died poor. I'm making this up. Right.

George Washington died in bankruptcy. Now I'm listening, right? Well, looking at some of these other ones, I don't know that any of these slap. George Washington's biggest failure, well the biggest failure that made him great, that's interesting. I don't know if the story we're about to hear supports that, but maybe enough. I think it does. I think it does.

But yeah, and then, I don't know, for the thumbnail, his mistakes from screw up to legend or. Something like that.

That's good. From Screw Up to Legend is really interesting, because I think everybody at a minimum would be interested to hear that journey. That's like a classic. dramatic arc. And also, there's a bit of selfishness of like, I'm a, I might be a screwup. How do I become a legend? Right, right, right.

Well, let's, I'm just going to go with this and we'll see how it does. I'm probably just going to, maybe I'll post a couple of versions or a couple of thumbnails or something, but. You could, yeah, you could do the AB test if you want the ABC test. Yeah.

I'm obsessed with those these days. Okay, let's let's go to the next one We are we spent a little bit of time on Cory DeAngelo. So I don't really want to dwell on him

Katie Kimball. This is a woman with an Instagram following, so that might bode in favor of putting a little more attention on her some of her clips. Oh wait, no. The last thing I wanted to do was the full episode title and thumbnail combination for this one that we're just working on.

That's the script for that. This was my idea. You don't need permission. Benton Crane on building the future. I don't know. This is pretty vanilla. But I like the thumbnail. You can just do stuff. Everyone's using that. It's kind of a meme right now. But I don't know how well it really compliments this. It might just be sort of reproducing like permissionless permissionless building or permission. I don't know.

And this is the same guy we just saw, right, about the, um, yeah.

You know, I just happened to look over in my YouTube thing here. And one of the titles is if you're ambitious, and in your 20s, or 30s, please watch this. Okay, right. Oh, shit. That's that's good. So it's like word. Well, if you're like, you know, something could be if you're, if you're feeling lost in your career, let's say if you're feeling lost in this or that or whatever, please watch this. That's

There's something about that, I don't know, gets me. Yeah, yeah.

There's another one here. This guy, this guy just started watching it. The title is I went back to India dot dot dot. It still sucks. I got to watch that, right? Like, how do I not watch that? No, I know. Like, what I'd love to do, because I found, I mean, with AI,

Examples are the most powerful prompting technique. And this has actually been verified in like studies, but I, I just found it intuitively and from other people talking about the same thing that the more rich examples you can give, like that's the best form of, of training.

Um, and in some, like instructions with examples can sometimes the instructions help. Sometimes they don't really, but like. If you just fed 20 examples of thumbnail title combinations that made you click, or the top title and thumbnails as measured by the.

how much better that video performed than the average video on the channel. What kinds of instructions or principles could you distill from the examples? I wonder. Like if you're a creative person in business, please watch this. If you feel like you're following the wrong path, please watch this. If you're drowning in data, but not, let's see.

If your kid hates school, please watch this. I mean, yeah, come on. My wife would click on that in a heartbeat. If your kid hates school, please watch this. So good. Okay, that's good. And then what was the... The suggested thumbnail, well, Benton Smiling, my kids joined bro school. I don't really love that one, but maybe something like skills are greater than credentials or there's another way, something like that.

There's another way. Break the rules for the thumbnail text. Break the rules is interesting.

Let's just say it's true for a second. You know, it's something that said, like, five tips. My five best tips. On the text on the thumbnail, where it's like, Oh shit, so I'm you're imploring me to watch this. And it seems like there's information in here that I can read.

What if we just say like, okay, something like five top five tips, something that indicates that there's information in this video that leads me there. Give me 10 more ideas for thumbnail text. I just want to iterate on this a little bit more.

Because that one I feel like we would have to deliver something in the editing style Maybe not maybe not but like the video in my view doesn't really

Sure.

It could be my best tips, and then you don't need to... Right, right, right.

Yeah, that could work.

All right, let's roll that. Let's go to the next one. Let's go to Katie Kimball. Because right now, I feel like Katie Kimball is weak. Not that the underlying content is weak, just that. I didn't do much with it. It's funny how like on my first pass through I can kind of feel like yeah you know this is good enough and then when I come back and look at it a few days later I'm like

This is just so suboptimal. Well, I mean, I think that that's a good that's a good exercise, man, to do some work and step away from it. Right, right. I think to my detriment, I don't have the patience. And like I make a thing, I'm like, I'm publishing. And if I could just say like, yo, I'm going to wait for a couple days and then look at it again. It's always better when you take another crack. Right, right.

Okay, this one, the real reason American kids are so anxious. Let's watch it. You look at our stats on anxiety, America has fallen off the list of top 20 happiest countries in the world. And it's because of the kids in their teens and 20s, their anxiety is so high.

When we bubble wrap our kids, a lot of parents are very safe, and very protective. And we call it helicopter parenting. Again, super well-intentioned. Parents aren't going out to be like, I'm going to mess up my kid. They're just like, I want to keep my kids safe. It's my job to keep them alive. But it actually makes kids really anxious when people are doing everything for them.

And when they feel like the world is a very scary place because we have to protect them. and you feel like you don't really have agency, you don't really have skills to take care of yourself because someone else has always done it for you. You're kind of like wandering about the world feeling really anxious because you have no control.

Really good. That's really good.

That feels like a good one. As I was watching that I was wondering about the size of all the text. Yeah, screen. Okay.

It might be a little big, but I would get that on your phone. Do you publish via phone, or do you have a tool? I publish on the computer. I would maybe just kind of sideload that onto your phone and take a gut check as to how it feels on the phone. And see, I think what you're trying to do, it should look like everybody else's. Right, right, right. There's no...

I'm going to make mine way different. Different is not the recipe for success, in this case. I suffer through this too, that I try to make mine stand out, but at the same time, I just need it to be what people expect. And sometimes when you're building at this scale, it's so tiny that it's like, oh, I'm just going to scale it up, like when I work on my computer. And then I realized, wow, this is fucking huge on the phone.

Yeah, I feel like at one point I'd copied this template from something that I saw that I liked, but if you have, if you could maybe, and I could do it too, but like... Find a couple of examples of exactly the format of content that we're creating, basically podcast clips. And just make a little bit more of a study of what are they doing with captions. Do the captions hang out for the full length of the video, or do they drop off after the first five seconds?

Do they change the on-screen text, or is it just something that can open up the clip? And I was doing I was trying to poke around a little bit on that and I looked up like what are some of the top And I think it also matters somewhat that the format here is a remote podcast of people doing like, you know Zoom conversation as opposed to an in-person Because that just changes the dynamic a little bit Yeah, I got it.

I got on my list to look at tonight. Let's see what I can find Caption here, on-screen caption, any thoughts?

I mean, it's definitely clear. It's not particularly sexy.

Like the number one reason. Right, right. Um, and then I'm not sure what American, I mean, If you're in a demographic that feels strongly that Americans are behind the eight ball versus the Chinese, let's say, American's gonna resonate. If you're not, I'm not sure what American brings to the table, because I think there's another demographic that says like American kids are the best kids, right?

Like. Right, so I think just kids.

Right, right. Kids. Number one reason kids are so anxious.

Yeah, I guess I'm not sure what cultures this would not apply to. Right, right, right, right. Like, I'm, I get the impression that Chinese and Jap, Asian kids in general are Much heavier helicopter. Right. It's my impression. Yeah. So I don't know French kids. Let's just go with let's just go with this. I think this'll

This will be good enough. Next one. And this one feels like it's pretty much an extension of the previous one. So I probably would just say, maybe I'm not gonna bother with this one. We've gotta give the kids like these skills and this feeling of like, I can fail.

I can burn the biscuits. And it's not a huge deal. I could still make better biscuits the next time. We want our kids to fail when the stakes are really low before we hand them the car keys and the fully unlocked iPhone. Because then the stakes are really high and they need to know how to take risks appropriately with things like a chef's knife or a paring knife or a hot stove before they're taking risks again like behind the wheel of a car.

Okay. So my initial reaction to that is that second graph is where to start. Yeah. And then that top graph is actually the last graph. Yeah. Agreed. Yeah. Okay, and I and I don't think this is a bad cliff. I if I were you, I would publish all this stuff. Yeah. And just just to see you know, like you're just

You're gonna have that many more soldiers in your army trying to win. Right, right. Yeah. I don't love, again, I don't really love the... Let them fail with low stakes first. We're like, do this before, do this before giving your kids an iPhone. Something like that.

You have kids real nice. It's funny. Like the, these, these are just like, I don't know, they're, they're captions in some other sense.

And actually, I might need a break here as much as I would love to continue on this thread. No worries, dude. Oh, shoot. Yeah, I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting the call. I've understood. Yeah, you're Just trying to think of this title. Do this before giving your kids an iPhone. How your kids can earn an iPhone.

OK, yeah, I like that. That might be a way to. You know, that's my wife thinks about that. And earning feels right. Every kid should earn a thing. Yeah. There you go, man. Yeah. I will look for these podcast clip screen text examples. And send them over. All right, and you let me know and I'm flexible if I know your world might be in flux right now so if you need to adjust Friday, even just the time so let me know.

It's hard for me to go a little later on Friday. That's fine, that's fine. But otherwise, oh, Friday's July 4th. Yeah. Would you still want to do it then? We'll skip Friday. Maybe we could do something on Thursday. Yes, I'm around. Let me know. Okay. Rock and roll, man. All right. Thanks, Andrew. Good talking to you. You got it. Bye-bye.
		

July 8 (1)

Summary

This meeting focused on analyzing and improving podcast clip strategy for TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, with emphasis on creating engaging short-form content from longer podcast episodes.

### Content Presentation Insights

- Less text on screen at a time for captions
- Well-spoken hosts in visually appealing environments perform better
- Color correction can significantly improve clip visuals
- Consider split-screen format with engaging "oddly satisfying" footage on one side
- Try adding narration or contextual text to standalone clips
- For clips without satisfying conclusions, add prompt to check description for the resolution

### Title and Thumbnail Strategies

- YouTube title suggestions: "Five Dyslexia Myths" is more broadly appealing than "Five Dyslexia Myths Every Parent Believes"
- For thumbnails, use expressive headshots with paraphrased quotes
- Add compelling text like "Schools are getting this wrong" to thumbnails
- Consider using "The Second Person Theory" as an intriguing title that promises a "hack"
- Try universalizing specific topics to appeal to broader audiences

### Content Volume Strategy

- Consider publishing 4-5 clips daily rather than being too selective
- One successful approach: "I don't have bad clips, I publish everything"
- Experiment with publishing the same clip with different titles to test engagement
- Even "wonkish" content might find a specific audience

### Visual Enhancement Ideas

- Try the "restyle" feature in Instagram Edits
- Explore using AI-generated characters as a "land grab" opportunity
- Consider using puppet-style characters that can be controlled off-camera
- Test creating a persona like "a horse trying to be an influencer"

### Action Items

- [ ]  Create thumbnails with expressive headshots and paraphrased quotes
- [ ]  Test YouTube title "Five Dyslexia Myths" with "Schools are getting this wrong" thumbnail text
- [ ]  Experiment with multiple title versions for the same content
- [ ]  Find stock footage library for split-screen content format
- [ ]  Create 3-5 daily reel prototypes to overcome creative block
- [ ]  Try using the "restyle" tool in Instagram Edits
- [ ]  Meet again on Friday at 1pm Pacific time

Notes

Transcript

So I think that there's probably some, you know, variability based on how.

So just generally like less words on screen at a time maybe. I am seeing that you know the captions. This is mostly TikTok, but I'm guessing that it can largely be generalized to... Yes, I based on what I see Instagram you can do it as well. I don't personally get served a lot of podcast stuff on Instagram.

I get that on TikTok, so this was served organically to me, everything you see here. The Instagram stuff I have searched for and you can find it and it's it. It's essentially the same, but it's not exactly the same kind of like organic delivery to me that I was hoping for. Right, right.

Yeah, it's so funny. This is a count. 32,000 followers, about 15 videos total. And he's just got a good eye for picking out the bangers, I guess. Yeah, you know what, I've done a little research on some of these types of accounts too. There is a... A sub syndicate often where these.

Accounts work for the actual podcast and sometimes they're they're almost like subcontracted out. We're like, they'll try out a guy and he'll build an account, and they'll never copyright strike him, so to speak, because it's like, you just do what you can to generate interest for us. And there are rewards at certain view counts. So

A lot of this clip show stuff, the clips of longer stuff, some of that, or maybe much of that, isn't as organic as it seems. Because it is, behind the scenes, an entire machine of, let's call them faceless content creators, maybe Indian kids, whoever, who are building this stuff.

As a kind of bounty.

Okay. Interesting. Yeah. Well, and last time we got through one or two, we got through, I think two podcasts. We went, we went. I've got several more podcasts in my queue right now with some clip. I was going back and looking at some of the clips again and they were just like.

They they left a bad taste in my mouth because they just I felt like there was a disconnect none of them had the context necessary Contained within the script or the combination of the script and the onscreen text to stand on their own. And that's, I feel like the biggest challenge with podcast clips is like either getting something that's funny enough, uh, wise enough, you know, that gives you that gives you a full arc without, uh, you know, that, that Theo Vaughn clip it's 11 seconds and it has a full, you know, it's a funny setup.

He's trying to think of the name of a disease. And then the name of the disease is just a stutter. Like that's, you know, that, that's. Um... I think you're right. I mean, I think the... The trouble with any kind of documentarian content collection is like sometimes it's perfect and sometimes it's not right.

And you, as a creator, need to decide, like, Can I craft it into something that is slightly imperfect but still publishable, or is it just a wash? I briefly touched on this in some YouTube video I just made, where when I'm on the street, it's a lot like fishing. I show up every day. It's whether or not there's anybody good on the street.

It's like sometimes there is, sometimes there isn't, and you kind of can't let that bum you out because you're showing up, you're doing the work, and just because I didn't see the most perfect person. Besides having shot 23 people. Yeah. But I didn't get a million view video.

It's like, that's life. You know, that's, that's the matter of like, all right, well, I'm going to keep on searching the game doesn't change, right? It's just a matter of So I would agree, but, and then, you know. Then in that kind of continuum, you're searching for hosts or interview subjects and or hosts who can consistently deliver that stuff.

And the other thing that I feel like I notice in the clips on your finger, Like the one guy that we reviewed one time, he's got the hat. He's like the last published post on TikTok. I don't know, I don't remember his name, but it's the George Washington. It's a screw up, right? Yeah.

I think he's super well-spoken, but he's not—I don't know who he is, and he's in a vaguely— Low rent background, right? Yeah. And looking at your stuff, it's like, you know what, I bet that matters, at least more to the initial audience. Yeah. Yeah. Right, right, right. Yeah.

And he's well spoken. And that kind of triple word score fundamentally does matter. Well, and this is another just sort of visual thing that David Spade thing. It's hyper, what's the word? The colors are amped up, it seemed like to me. And he is totally washed out here.

So if we go to George Washington is a screw up and I can at them. Yeah, it's super. It's just like all grays basically. And I can do there's some effects that I could do one at one that I usually been doing in the For the full episodes is a blur speaker background. You can even do a green screen, but that seems like it, what are you going to put back there? That's not going to be hokey, but then also just like color adjustments. And I'm actually going to, I'm going to bring this guy upstairs in a second.

My wife said I could bring him up, but it'll just take me two seconds. Like if we, you know, turn that, that's just going to look weird. If I turn up the saturation, maybe I can do something. Take down the shadows, bring up the highlights a little bit or, you know, contrast a little bit of.

I, it's probably tough to like really resolve this in a clip like that. I mean, I think actually you're making some progress here. You know, I wonder if I'm not I'm sure you've seen these tick tocks were like on one half of the screen, there's like somebody talking on the other half of the screen. There's like somebody like

I don't know, like there's like a taffy machine, right? Right. It's almost like nonsensical, right? Oddly satisfying stock footage. You know, maybe there's something to that, right? Yeah, come for the... Come for the laffy taffy stay for the the insight. Yeah, it's very much engineered like a casino game of like, I kind of don't know why it's all blinking and flashing and making noises, but I'm here because I have a lizard brain and I'm watching right, you know, those kind of tactics may be interesting if you have access to stock footage as you do.

And it might be something worth trying of like put one of these talking heads. on the top and put the laughing taffy twisting on the bottom and see if you can get folks to pay a little bit longer attention. Yeah. Yeah, all right. Let me let me run upstairs and okay.

I'll be back in one minute. Yep.

Okay, so we might try that tactic of just like, you know, something that's maybe even very tangentially related. You had also talked about maybe doing a little bit of like a Yeah, I think so, especially with voiceover that like either maybe you can record or something that just feels like.

It's meant for that right right like the George Washington when I think it's already talked about that right because It's talking about something historical. So it's like, oh, this won't even, this might feel like a documentary even in a positive way. Right, right. So that we, and I had my VA. George Washington, before he became president, before he became general, before he became a legend, as a young man, 22 years old, he was sent out to the Ohio territory to tell the French to leave.

Cause at that point it hadn't been fully claimed yet by the French nor the British, but the French were kind of setting up camp and whatnot. And so the British were like, well, we need them to leave. And so they sent young George Washington. as a young military officer out to tell the French to leave. And the interaction goes horribly wrong. I'm not going to spoil the story here and share all the details, but basically George screws up in the worst possible ways and accidentally sets off a global war.

Massive blunder. Career-destroying-type mistakes here. And this is a story about how George goes from hitting rock bottom, making the worst possible mistakes, to turning that around in this character-defining moment where he ends up in a battle, and General Braddock is killed.

And things are going terribly wrong, and George needs to lead an evacuation. He basically needs to get his troops out of there. And so he mounts a horse and charges the enemy lines. Yes. It ends up with three bullet holes in his coat and a couple more in his hat, but he goes unscathed. He gets the troops together, executes a successful retreat, saves hundreds of lives, proves his bravery, his valor. This is the beginning of the legendary George Washington.

I feel like both extremes are dangerous, right? You know, on the one extreme where if you just focus on, oh, man, George Washington was so amazing, he was a legend, blah, blah, blah, people are gonna be inspired by that. They're gonna feel like, oh, I'll never live up to that.

No, that's not me. Whereas on the flip side, like, you know, you go back to 2020 when all the, you know, monuments were being torn down and stuff. And this idea of like, hey, these guys were imperfect. They owned slaves. Therefore, they were dirtbags. Therefore, we should tear down their monument. We should erase them from history. That's dangerous, too, right? It's really important, in my opinion, to acknowledge that they were flawed human beings. They were imperfect.

They made major mistakes. But despite all that, they also made massive contributions to set up what we now benefit from. And I think that's so much more inspiring, you know, for my 14-year-old son to hear a story where he's like, man, that guy really screwed up, but then he turned around and he's still brave and he's heroic.

And I want my son to know that, like, despite being a human, despite being weak, despite having flaws, I can still be brave. I can still swing for the stars and try to do something big. I think that's a really important message.

I mean, for a YouTube video, that could work. I mean, that could be something that's interesting. Right, not for a short, but for the actual. Yeah, I think it's just like, you know, it's dramatically too long for a short. But for a YouTube video, yeah. I mean, I also, if the goal would be to...

Deliver awareness around a podcast, hoping that someone watches to the end to get said awareness message. I would just put some lower third on there that says, you know... Right, right. You know, lower lower third on your like bending crane like from the open

Yeah, just to have it, you know, or even like a little logo bump that pops up in the corner somewhere just so that you constantly. are hitting the audience with, you know, we've got, this is where it's from. Right, right. Yeah. And this one, it kind of a weird, like the topic doesn't really relate to Open Ed's topic.

Not to say that it's, we can't do some of that, but I feel like maybe we'd want. Kind of a lower ratio of this kind of content to more topical. Well, I mean, this is probably good though. I mean, I think the fun part about the podcast is that you get to throw a wide net.

I have the reverse problem on Velvet, where it's like, I'm not just about street portraits, right? Like, I would love to be about a lot of things, but I've done... The opposite of this, where I've only done street portraits, and so now I'm trying to throw a wider net so that I can talk about other things, bring them to me.

I would encourage any creator to be like, try to allow yourself to be broader. Otherwise you're gonna. comedy or otherwise is going to have an upper limit. Yeah. And you kind of, you want more, you know, like all these, all these comedy guys. gotten into politics likely, or at least partially, due to the fact that like comedy has a audience limiter.

Right, like, SNL can only get so big. But if you're Howard Stern or Theo Vaughn or Joe Rogan, at some point, you need to be about more than just— sketch comedy stuff if you want to attract a $300 billion dollar. Spotify. That's, I think, how that happens.

Yeah, okay. So I think we can go in a couple directions here. I have, I do have a few more clips prepped, but I think last time what was helpful. Was kind of going through more of like the workflow that I use to come up with the concepts for the clips and the titles and thumbnails for the episodes.

So like this one. Let me share again. This is an episode that I thought was kind of a stinker as an actual podcast episode, and none of the clips were very good. It's about dyslexia and there's she, I mean like the full episode, it kind of meanders around. I actually don't think that this host, Andrea Phyfe, she did about five episodes and then she's sort of.

I feel like don't actually tend to produce very good clips. Interesting. For what it's worth. Okay. Yeah, no, I mean, I think that's a super great insight. But yeah, they you know, they talk about kind of the it's basically like the myths around dyslexia. And I think that that's probably

In the title, something like that, you know, the dyslexia myths that are hurting kids, what parents need to know something like that, or there's another one, the list format five dyslexia myths. Uh huh. Right, right. You know, and, and, you know, back to the shorter one.

It could just be five dyslexia myths, as opposed to that every parent believes. Or maybe and why they're wrong or not, or like, maybe not. I mean, like, based on what we just saw, you know, it was three words and an emoji.

Yeah, and then, you know, in terms of loading other kinds of keywords or... You know, I don't have any attachment to putting the guest name in the title, especially if they don't have... name recognition. Are you talking about YouTube videos? Are we talking about YouTube videos? I'm talking about YouTube title and thumbnail.

Yeah, I mean, five dyslexia myths seem strong to me.

You could add the with whoever, but, you know, I guess I think about this a bit that. Sometimes you want to narrow down your audience so that it really hits. And then other times, you kind of want to leave it broad because every word after you're really sexy.

Like, for instance, five dyslexia myths. That's a banger. parent believes. It's like, okay, so now it's for parents. If I'm not a parent, that's not for me. It's kind of a filter to lessen the audience. Is that really necessary? Now, if you desperately want to just talk to parents, and in our case, we might want to.

Then that filter may be helpful, but if all we want are views. It's possible we'd say, you know what, maybe there's a bunch of 15-year-old kids struggling with dyslexia that are gonna see this in EJM. yeah yeah um okay and then for like the uh An accompanying thumbnail, there's some different things here, most of these are no good.

really what that refers to in the episode. That's kind of intriguing. They were about these maybe seem like too much text. This The longer you wait the harder it gets I don't know if that really has the complementarity

And like I'm kind of going off of a paraphrase quote that we could put with the guests head like we've done a few of that format, and we could do it. Yeah, I think the original instruction and this to me is like, not very compelling but You know, and then this just reiterates the title directly. So I don't know that this is quite the right one, but if we you know, a thumbnail like this style versus the

The expressive headshot with a paraphrased quote. I kind of like that format because it's, it's easily replicable. I think I could just decide like, that's just what we're going to do for, for this current batch of podcasts and see how it performs. But I would agree.

I think the, the expressive headshot. And you can try variations, either an adult or somebody struggling. Whether it is a kid or whether it is an adult, and then

You know, I agree about the quote. To me, it should directly relate to... The title. Right, right. So like top five dyslexia myths. And then, you know, something like...

Sounds so stupid, but it's like, number three. Number three blew my mind.

Right.

I'm thinking here, hold on a second. No. Top five.

I didn't believe it. Right, right, right. Something like that. Something that kind of like reinforces the surprising nature of the myths. Yeah, yeah.

Schools are getting this wrong is your yeah. Yes, that's great. Schools are getting it wrong. It's really good. Okay. I like that.

I don't know if parent doesn't need to be in parentheses or. Anything too fancy? Okay, and for this one, yeah I'm probably gonna do a blog post about this just because the episode wasn't that great But I think that it is good good content inside of it. It just needs to be

and I also tried for some shorter clips, or longer clips rather, but none of them were that awesome. Um, let me go, let me go to. Another one here. Does this look familiar? Michelle Rhee? How to regain control when you've lost your classroom? They ate me for lunch. This is a woman who's big in sort of like education reform circles, not so much among

Like homeschool or, you know, parent, home educators. So there were a couple of titles here, like, okay, the number one mistake that leads to classroom chaos and how to fix it. That could be applicable to a. a homeschool parent or something. Sure. You know.

Something that speaks to parents as teachers or what to do when your students don't respect you. Those all sound great. The Michelle Rhee one, the number three, option three. That one though really relies on her. So you're either in or you're out based on that title.

The other ones, like what to do when your students don't respect you, that seems like a banger. If you're a teacher, how do you not click on that? Right, right, right. You know, you kind of have a teacher image in a classroom. I mean, that thumbnail makes itself a distraught teacher.

with crazy kids in a classroom in the background, right? Well, and if it needs text, I don't know that it necessarily does, but this was a good paraphrasing quote. They ate me for lunch. Yeah, and that's good. And you're right, it might not, honestly. I mean, I do think that there's a certain thumbnail style that doesn't use that.

But you're still doing the same thing where it's like, wow, there's a lot of questions. Based on what I'm seeing here that I have to click to get the answers, right, even not me and not even that I'm interested, but that like like often I watch these police body cam videos, and it's like,

You know, some woman destroyed a Walmart, and there is no on screen text on the thumbnail but it's the woman. Right, right. Yeah, no, it's true. A picture is worth a thousand words. Yeah, I think about that with my thumbnails often to where it's like, should I do the thing where I add a text? Or should I do something that's just so like what?

Right, right. Because sometimes when I confront people on the street and ask to take their photo, their initial expression... looks very ominous. And it's like, oh, if I just stop on that frame. and make that the thumbnail. And then the title is This almost went wrong, right, you know, it's like, oh shit. Yeah, right, like, or I made a serious mistake. You know, like,

That's a video you might click. Yeah. Um, so, and, and speaking, speaking of this, there's. This also is probably the best clip. I don't think that are in my original notes. I had even done this I had done more Staying with a teacher for two years in a row, but that it's just like it's too wonkish. It's all about like policy stuff Homework she talks about this one. I think also like when I went through this again I was like this this doesn't doesn't really hit me but then Um, just thinking about this again.

Okay, so she talks about this is this is the transcript and I can try to make it a little bigger um I had one of the toughest first year teaching experiences probably in my core year I was assigned to a third grade classroom at one of the worst performing elementary schools in baltimore

So they ate me for lunch. This one, it's got a good setup with the storytelling, but it seems like it doesn't actually really deliver any catharsis or any lesson. Would you agree? I mean, yeah, based on that, there's, it's just like. Teaching is tough, you know. On the other hand, in the description, you might be able to add a lesson.

Like you might be able to have something on the screen that says like description for her solve or something. So if she goes into elaborate detail. about how she addressed this or how she got through it. You might be able to add that into the description copy. Yeah, yeah.

And the only reason to do that would be to call it out in the video. So that people spend longer reading that and the videos playing in the background.

This one, this could complete it.

Through that experience what I realized was the environment these kids were growing up in didn't change. None of that changed.

I think there could be something here that I could play with, but the on-screen text... So the on-screen text for something that you're saying could maybe fill in Well, and I don't like this idea of an on-screen text strategy that isn't all up front where you have to, where the on-screen text changes as it goes. I feel like that's just...

I just want it to be at the beginning. Yeah, I mean... I think what I'm describing is, it's that first graph that you showed me where she describes working in Baltimore, lowest performing kids, the whole thing. And either on the whole time or on towards the middle end is something that says.

Check the description for how she solved it, you know, right, right. And then in the description, you could write. Even a third person like your summary of how she addressed it. Right, right, right. You know, or if there's a combination of quotes that you can put together from her, but like.

That might be a way to address a clip that doesn't have a sexy ending. It's like, well, the ending, it's the same thing of like, you know, five strategies to homeschool your kid. In the below right like it's it's that thing except longer, right? No, I like that. I like that

If it gets people to stick around and that bodes in favor of making it pretty short. Then it would say like, OK, here's kind of just a first draft of. I'll work on it. I think I can do something with this. That's a good idea. I like that. And I'm just going to do one clip for most of these podcast episodes. Okay. Well, actually, something to mention about this. So I have a buddy who has been trying to build up

stuff. And he has run entirely kind of like against what I would have assumed it worked, which is he is publishing like four or five times on Instagram and Tick Tock. Okay. Every day, he's just generating a shit ton of clips. And you can look at his metrics and you can see that he is sneaking up.

And it's like, wow, that's interesting. I never would have recommended that, especially on Instagram. But it seems to be working, but it is definitely working on TikTok, for sure. And so, you know, his philosophy fundamentally is, I don't have bad clips, I publish everything.

He has no ego about the ones that get 12 views and and sometimes they get 5000 and he has $100 So, I would say, I looked at that, his metrics enough to say. Man, if you have the output, I would be less picky. about which one is the one making it, especially if it's all the same effort, right?

If it's like, no, bro, I don't have time to make that many clips. Okay, that's the that's the reason not to do it. But if you're making them or backing away from the table. because you don't think they're good. I would say, go for it and see what happens. Like the one that you said is wonkish. That's what got me thinking about this. Cause maybe you would find.

a cohort of like people who were just into it. They're like, oh, this is exactly the kind of shit I've been looking for. Right. Super inside baseball, super, you know, like that's how you find a niche.

Yeah. All right. And if those are clips that your VA can do too, that might be the benefit. Revisit this one Chris Vassell. This is the dyslexia one because I think maybe that you know with the Five Dyslexia Myths. Was that the one we settled on? I think so. Yeah.

The original quotes that I had, let's just take, I already rejected some of them because they, because a lot of them just kind of start off on a note where it's like, what the heck are we talking about? But let's see. It's easy for us as parents to be like, I'm gonna educate my kid and I know all the answers. And I've just experienced so many times, there are moments in my education, opportunities for my kids, when I've had to swallow my pride and recognize there might be a different person that needs to be that second person in their life who's gonna literally say the same things I've said to them.

And this one actually is maybe not too bad. It's just, I'd probably just cut out this beginning part here. And I could actually pull up the actual clip. Let's try listening to this. It's really easy for us as parents to be like, I'm going to educate my kid and I know all the answers. And I just have experienced so many times there are moments in my education opportunities for my kids when I had to swallow my pride and recognize that there might be a different person that needs to be that second person in their life, who's going to literally say the same things that I said to them for the past year at school, but having a second person come in and

Here, do this, do that. It all of a sudden rings through in their ears. I call it the second person theory. It happens all the time in the school world. And I feel like sometimes as a parent, when you're just like, I'm just going to swallow my pride and see if there's somebody else who can meet my kiddo's needs right now and then utilize a tutor to do that.

That's interesting. The second-person theory... Strikes me as an interesting title caption for that. Right, right.

I want to hear what this is, you know, because if you.

Um, what was the original one? It's not mom's fault or something? Um, white kids won't listen to mom. Yeah, so that's, I mean, that's not bad, but it's kind of not giving you anything extra because that first line is about parents. So it's like, I know it's about parents, right?

The second person theory is like, I understand that and then I'm about to hear about parents like, okay, so is it It plays to that desire for a hack, you know, like, oh, give me the hack. Right, right. And again, I think here, her, her, she, we've got some,

with with some yeah, I wouldn't get too crazy with the that stuff personally, but I would say it is something to keep in mind for like if and when You have to give a shit, you have to have the leverage to be able to dictate to a guest like this is what we need, right? But it's like, you know...

It's why things need to look so nice. And it's like, you know, what is the nicest? Set up you've got podcast interviewee. Right, right. Very difficult. And you could see why like podcasters bring people into their studio, it just looks beautiful. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I might be able to.

Just kind of one thing that can work, and this might be a good place to try that. You know, sticky laffy taffy thing and just, you know, sort of shrink this down. Yeah. For a while, I was doing a lot of stuff like, just like this with a little, you know, textured paper background.

It's not quite as grainy. Like I think already this does look a lot better.

Yeah, I got to find that that stock footage library for the. Yeah, give that a shot. Yeah. But I won't do that now. Hey guys, I need 15 more minutes, okay?

Let's see. Well, yeah, this already here is looking. It's looking a lot better. One more thing the other I wanted to check and see if the other clip here. Something about dyslexia.

The only thing I was thinking about dyslexia a second ago was that dyslexia itself is its own filter. And, you know, it affects a small subset of. the population. So I wonder, I guess what I would game out for myself. in a few minutes is like, is there a way of pulling the same emotional triggers?

without it being about dyslexia in the title, so that you could almost extrapolate the learnings to your personal disorder. Like, if you're not dyslexic, but you're depressed, like Because I guess the worst part about the Dyslexia title is that you better...

Want to know about dyslexia, right? Like, if you don't care about dyslexia, then you're not in. But if you kind of care about something that can be more broadly applicable.

then you might be able to use dyslexia as a way of explaining people jump the gun on this or that disease or whatever. I'm just, that's kind of abstract, but like, that would be something to consider. I think about this in context of like my camera stuff, where it's like,

If I'm making a camera review about X camera, you better care about that camera. Otherwise, you're not going to watch this fucking video. Right, right. And how do I make this more broadly appealing? This is the this is my favorite camera of all time. Okay, now I'm going to get a lot more people.

Come to this video then as opposed to the Sony a7R V is the best camera I've ever used. That might be less intriguing, right? Because people want to know what it is, they kind of want to compare it to No, that's that's good. I mean, I just took a chunk of your transcript. I wish I'd gotten that that last part in because I think that was also

A perfect example of how to universalize the interest here. Um, so if we like, okay, the myth that's destroying struggling students, I think one of the biggest myths is that struggling students can't learn. I think, did that change? Well, it actually changed the language. I think one of the biggest myths is that students with dyslexia can't learn to read. So that's actually what the transcript says. So maybe this isn't quite the right applicable one. I mean, if this is like truly, truly about dyslexia, then, you know.

It's going to be where it's going to be. But something to consider that like your title, whether it's a YouTube video title or like the on-screen, you know, headline caption. That can bring people in but it also is its own inherent filter. And what can you do to make that as broadly appealing as possible?

Despite the fact that like the underlying subject matter is truly pretty specific. Right, right, right. Are you up for an experiment? Or do you mind if I just, again, borrow this exactly? And I'm going to say one more thing here. Note, you cannot. I've changed the actual content of the transcript that is set in stone because it's what we're actually working with.

Because this is, this is genius. I mean, this stuff, like your, your words get, uh, get converted into my, uh, my prompts oftentimes. And if I had been. More diligent after each session, I'd probably go in and tweak everything that we talk about to be a little bit, a little bit closer because.

That's the real art of prompt engineering. I'd say it's 90% examples, and then the remaining 10% is sort of how you craft the instructions. But if you can come up with good examples of input-output, Then you can get incredible results.

Let's see... Dyslexia myth... The most damaging myth parents here... When everyone says your child can't, they're wrong. Things like that So the and and this might be an example where take the exact same video right dyslexia video Yeah, make the title we're planning on and then make an alternate and publish one this week and one next

Yep. And, and just see, you know, like, how would that work? Does one work better? And we'll be able to look at the views week over week and just see like, did we see anything discernibly different there? Or is it generally the same amount? Okay. Alright, sounds good.

I mean, there's several more episodes in the queue here. We've already looked at We did Bend and Crane last week. We've done, I don't want to spend any more time on Corridi Angelis. Daryl Stinson. This one I probably haven't done enough. Uh, kind of preliminary work on this one to really know what the episode is about. So maybe I'll, I'll hold off on that. Uh, one other thing I was just trying to remember is when I sent you that one video of the horse talking head, you had sent me the tool for that.

And I think it was part of the Instagram universe. It was like there. Oh, Instagram edits, it's called. It's called Instagram edits. And there is a thing called restyle. I believe it's called- Yeah, restyle. That's the feature. Okay.

And then I think maybe our next meeting I want to get back to Just general, like if we're talking about trying to put out three, four, or five reels a day. I think maybe I still need to overcome this block. creating with any sort of, let alone volume, just getting some more prototypes out there. And I kind of keep coming back to...

You know, I don't want to lean too heavily on my phone. Camera roll. I don't want to lean too heavily on myself as a talking head unless I can somehow get it so that I'm speaking through Ed or something like that. I mean, I could still try some where I'm talking and I hold the little microphone and I comment on a trend. I should actually try a few of those because it'll be a good exercise for me to just overcome my stage fright or something.

Well, yeah, I think it's it to me, it's humorous to hear you say you've seen tricks. I've seen you on camera. You're good. Okay, like, so I wouldn't worry about that. I think that you're well, well, well above the bar of needing to worry about how good you are on camera.

You know, it could be as simple as any of these podcast clips and you green screen yourself on top just pointing. Somebody is kind of co-signing that this is valuable information. Right, right, right. That might be a way of doing it. And also the it doesn't even need to be in

The horse open ed style, but maybe try a video with the restyle thing of something that's broadly appropriate. There's like a marble person one, right? Just something interesting. There's a couple different creatures and, you know, read a 15 second monologue.

or something that somebody, a host has already said, but now you read it in your voice. And like, you know, there's no way to screw this up. I would say just throw noodles at the wall there and just see. If you can get any kind of uptick on anything. I mean right now I feel is the time for

Like an AI character land grab. If I had that at my disposal, I would definitely be trying to. Yeah, all right, make it happen there. Because it feels like, you know, one of these is going to bubble to the top and you like, Oh, that that guy is great. Like the

The Sasquatch one, the Bigfoot one, that's kind of worked. And I think it's just whether or not that has legs. Right, right. Well, my idea is still to do almost like... Make it a little bit lo-fi intentionally, like have it generate the video of the talking head and it's gonna put in whatever background you'd expect from a...

a horse, but then do like the green screen effect on the horse and make it like the horse is kind of trying to be an influencer in the style of these other talking heads, something like that. Yeah. Um, I mean, it's a very old meme, obviously, but you've seen like the rubber horse head.

It's a different vibe. It's kind of more in the meme. culture universe. But, you know, there's, God, there. I feel like for two decades I've been chasing this idea of a puppet that I can control. I love the idea of Triumph, the insult comic. Like, I can't tell you how often. Are you familiar with him? Yep. Okay. I can't tell you how often I think about him.

Because if you have him at your disposal and you can use him for anything, you're done. You're done. You could talk about Nabisco, you could talk about pop culture, you could go live on the street, like that's it like That could be huge. And all you've got to do is make that. So maybe there's a horse...

stuffed animal that you can find and you can green screen that and you could just puppet it. You know, like, there's endless kind of things like that, where all you really need to do is be able to have a creature that can talk on your behalf, or indicate on your behalf, you know, even with like a stupid little hoof, like the way tribe I'm not sure how familiar you are. He's got the puppet but he also has that there's a stick

And so off camera, you could have a paw come in, is how triumph works. So it's like a two-handed puppet, and you can point at things, you can touch people, you know, you can do all kinds of stuff. Yeah.

Well, let me get back to you with something next week. Okay. Or Friday. Friday, Friday. Yeah. That should work. I'll be in LA, but I'm totally available. Oh, yeah? Are you sure? I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, no, for sure, no problem. Good deal. It'll be, but it'll, yeah, it'll be the same time, but it'll be earlier for me, so it'll be noon.

Right? What time do we do it? Sorry. Now my big kids want to say hi. You're just getting to see the whole family today. How are you? I guess they can't hear you, but yeah, go ahead. Okay, so it'll be 1 p.m., 1 p.m. Pacific time, so I'll do it at 1, yeah.

Got it.

And if for any reason I happen to be late because my computer has not reliably adjusted time zone things and when to notify me, just text me. Because I'm absolutely planning on it. I'm just trusting that all of my gear auto understands. I am now in Pacific time and all of my dates and times and alerts.

Yeah, I think it will. I always enjoy your social media recommendations. I'm still, I was re-watching that Paul Newman. I'm all ears. Yeah, what have I been coming across recently? I've been watching the Casey Neistat vlogs again, I'll tell you that I I have this thing I'm trying to crack for myself where like I would love to be uploading YouTube videos more consistently. Yeah. And

I had a semi-breakthrough this weekend where my workflow pipeline of going out and capturing stuff on the street with the gear, being able to sync all that audio up after the fact, so I was able to edit the vlog that I published this morning. in like four hours yesterday. And I was like, oh shit, that was fast.

for me. And so I'm wondering how often I can do that. Maybe a lot more frequently. And a lot of that came from like, I need to watch how Casey does this. Not that mine is anywhere near as good, but. I think I have a sense of it.

Interesting. I'll check him out. I, I, yeah, I've never really watched his stuff, but... He's basically, he's kind of credited as making the first daily vlog, even though he didn't, but he like really revolutionized the genre. Right, right. So, yeah man. But like always man, I'm around if you have any questions or want to run anything by me, just hit me up.

I'll be traveling a little bit on Thursday, but otherwise. Okay. Awesome. Thanks as always, Andrew. It's a pleasure. You got it, man. You got it. All right. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.

## Suggestions for Podcast Thumbnail and Title

### For "If Your Kid Hates School" Episode:

- Show an image of an upset kid instead of just the guest
- Include a pointing hand gesture toward "one tip"
- Add more visual elements for better engagement
- Play for shock value to get more clicks

### For "Teacher Lost Control of Classroom" Episode:

- Replace current layout with more dramatic imagery
- Consider showing an upset teacher with rambunctious kids
- Use stock photos instead of hand-drawn style
- Simplify the text from "They ate me for lunch" to something more direct like "They hate me"
- Use higher contrast and fewer words
- "Dial it to 11" - make it more attention-grabbing

Note: Andrew mentioned that the layout/storyboard concept is good, but should be modernized with actual photos rather than illustrations for better engagement.

Charlie Deist
How's LA treating you?

Andrew Muto
It's good, it's good. I'm kind of just getting started. Thursdays are slow here, but tonight, this afternoon and tonight should be crazy.

Charlie Deist
Nice. You're doing your thing. You're doing the street photography?

Andrew Muto
Yeah, just same thing. Yeah, just up and down. Kind of like the Venice, Santa Monica boardwalk area. Nice. And I always forget, like, my one issue is that there are lots of folks that, like, are peddling for stuff, you know, like street performers. And so I have to differentiate myself from them. People think that I want money and I'm like, I don't want any fucking money.

Charlie Deist
Right, Right.

Andrew Muto
So that's. It's interesting. I forgot about that again. Like, when I did this last year too. I was like, it's a constant problem.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. Well, you might run into my friend, Case Bradford down there. He's kind of in the. The new muscle beach scene a little bit.

Andrew Muto
Okay.

Charlie Deist
He's. He's biggest on Twitter and then after that, Instagram. Let me see. I don't actually know what's. What's his handle on Instagram. He's. I. I became friends with him through Twitter and we became good friends. Like, he comes up and visits me here, I visit him down there. But he's. He's a really cool, just like, authentic guy with. The thing is, he doesn't wear very many clothes, so I don't know if I feel like. Although it's always the sort of, you know, addition by subtraction, right?

Andrew Muto
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think my angle here needs to be too. Like, some people just are like, weird. Like there's like weird people. And I think that's. It is less like badass fits and more like, bro, you're a character. What is your story?

Charlie Deist
Yeah, I don't know if he'll fit that mold then. But anyway, that neither here nor there.

Andrew Muto
Rock and roll bad. What do you have for today?

Charlie Deist
So I've got some more podcast stuff. Just because in a way this month for me, like, I'll consider it a win if. If I can just like get. Get, you know, continue kind of leveling up what we're putting out for the podcast. The other thing is, I'm still stuck. Stupid, stupid little things. But I still can't find where the heck I made that AI avatar of the horse. I know we mentioned it yesterday, but were you saying it. Was it edits? Was it the edits app?

Andrew Muto
Yeah. Inside of Instagram edits is a. Is a feature called Restyle.

Charlie Deist
Let me do this in real time because I was looking for it and like, well, I guess I can't hold my screen up to my screen. Maybe what I can do. Let me see first. I'll just come into it and see. Why am I such a. I feel like the, you know, the 86 year old that I work with, I'm always having to coach him through things on his phone and now here I am. Okay, so on the main screen I see.

Andrew Muto
So if you click into a video, if, like you have to make a project.

Charlie Deist
Okay.

Andrew Muto
And then click on a video and I assume the video needs to be a talking head.

Charlie Deist
Okay.

Andrew Muto
And then once you. Once a video is highlighted, like you can see it in yellow there, then there's a button that says Restyle and you click the restyle and then you get all these characters that pop up.

Charlie Deist
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Show that, show that again from the.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, so if you, if you, if you're in the timeline and you click one of your clips in the timeline, there's a button that says Restyle at the bottom.

Charlie Deist
Okay. Can't restock clips over 10 seconds. That's good to know. So maybe have to be kind of like a succession of.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, that's.

Charlie Deist
That's fine. Restart. Okay. Okay. And then you've got your characters. Right. And they might have a. Right. Okay, they've got the Yeti. All right. Okay, let me see what I can do here. Not right now, but I will sure get on that.

Andrew Muto
And this, it might be helpful to like, if that's a hack, like that might actually work because it's, you know, it's ubiquitous, like meta's supporting it. It's right there in the app. It's free. And I would bet even that 6 second limit gets adjusted over time.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, somehow I'm doing this. There's some weird thing with my.

Andrew Muto
The top down. Yeah. What is Tape tabletop view.

Charlie Deist
Give me one second just to see if I can figure this out. Otherwise I'll. Oh, I know what it is. Here we go. There's desk view camera. I don't know what that for.

Andrew Muto
It's for like top. It's like for top down. Like hands.

Charlie Deist
Like now I want to play with it, but I'm. I'm not going to. All right. Yeah. So let's see. I mean on the, on the reels front I had, you know, I still just overcoming some kind of block to just creating and like I feel like I need to. Part of me feels like I need to set a very modest goal. Like just create one thing and then there's another part of me that feels like I need to just power through it and try to create like 10 different things. And then from that, I don't know, maybe there's a middle ground.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, well, I mean, so. So what are you. What is the bl. Like, what are you trying to do? Like we. We. You want to prototype new stuff, right? Like that's the idea.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, I think, I think what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to pair some kind of video footage with some kind of on screen text. Because that, to me, feels like the thing that I can churn out with the most frequency. And I actually, I had a good one the other day. I didn't. I didn't actually finish it, but let me see. There was this. It was, it was actually some. I just looked up oddly satisfying footage and one of the first ones that I found and now I can't find it anymore. But it was like these hot, you know, piping hot metal balls being dropped on these, like little layers of foam and they're like dissolving through them.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, I'm familiar with that, yeah.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. And so they get to the bottom at different, slightly different speeds. And my thought was to pair that with just like, you know, all the text kind of shows. Or maybe the text would show up in succession, but something like, you know, the text would be like, kids learn to walk at different ages and the balls keep falling. They learn to talk at different ages, they learn to tie their shoes at different ages. And then the punchline is sort of, so why do we cram? Why do we make every kid learn algebra at the same exact age? Something like that. Where the text can kind of do the heavy lifting of the content. The oddly satisfying footage is there for the add among us and to stop the scroll and give them a little bit of eye candy to stick around for that punchline. Like, I think I could, I could execute on this one pretty easily.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. I mean, I would say, you know, just dive right in. You know, like find, find 10 or 15 minutes and just go for it. And you might, you. First of all, you'd probably feel some sense of satisfaction in that. You're like, you've, you've done it. But also what I love about just prototyping stuff is that I immediately start answering some of the questions that I have and like, oh, I see some potential pitfalls that I need to revise. Right. Like, oh, I talk too fast or something. Right. It's like, I see I have to fix these things.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
And that starts you down this road of like very fast evolutions on ideas.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
And same with like the talking head and the D and the restyle thing. But I would just record one. I would just do one and then pop yourself in and you're going to start to discover, you know, along with a six second thing like, oh, how do I make this work properly?

Charlie Deist
Right, right. You see this?

Andrew Muto
Yes. That's great. I've seen versions of that too, where they drop bigger ones into stuff like, like aloe, aloe lotion or aloe gel or something and it like burns through well.

Charlie Deist
So. And again, like with the fair use kind of thing, I mean, if I find a way to scrape this and I. That that shouldn't be that hard, but I was actually having some trouble scraping it in a decently high resolution. Do you have any, any inside knowledge into how I might approach that? Like, obviously I'm not going to go out and make this video myself, but I also think it's a pretty low risk for strikes, especially if.

Andrew Muto
Yeah.

Charlie Deist
You know, posting this to Instagram instead of YouTube.

Andrew Muto
Well, the first two things that I would do is one is sometimes. Almost all of these apps allow you to kind of remix a video, so I would first see how much legwork you can get out of that. Okay, that, like on Instagram or TikTok and even YouTube shorts. Sometimes they might be able to restrict that, though, but you can remix it and, like, add your take to it. Now, sometimes it's just. Just like a cut to, like, it's not, you know, screen on screen there. You can't affect it. Right, right. But in cases where I need to screen grab something or screen record it, I'll look at it on my phone and screen record it on my phone. I generally get the highest resolution there, and then it's in your camera roll, and then you can do whatever you want with it. And it usually includes the audio, too.

Charlie Deist
If there's something audio, that's okay. I like that.

Andrew Muto
I do that for everything, for YouTube or whatever. Just. It's easiest just record it on your phone because all the system audio, everything is just like, built in.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. Yeah.

Andrew Muto
And then you can work on top of it.

Charlie Deist
My. My other thought was to do this horse. Some asmr. Horse horse shampooing and horse grooming. I could actually even. I don't have a horse, but I do have cows. I could do some cow grooming. Asmr.

Andrew Muto
Yeah.

Charlie Deist
I mean, you're even.

Andrew Muto
Even dual screening that, like we talked about last time, like, have that on the bottom half of the screen and have your content on the top.

Charlie Deist
Right, right.

Andrew Muto
Just go for it.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. Okay, well, let's. Let's turn to podcasts for a minute. Unless you have more. More thoughts on how I might kind of get out of this.

Andrew Muto
No, I mean, I would just. I would try. If you find yourself working on anything for longer than 15 minutes, I think that's a warning sign that at this, like, fast prototyping stage.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
The thing is, like, just get a version done. You don't have to publish it, but, like, work really fast to just get it done and get out of your own way. I find that with myself, too. Like, this morning I was editing this. I don't often post stories on Instagram reels, and I put together this, like, edited one, and I had to take a couple minutes, be like, I don't give a fuck how this turns out. Just bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. And I could have nickel and dime the hell out of it, but instead I just. I was like, fuck it. It's like 90% good. This last 10% would take me two and a half hours, and I'm not going to do it.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, fuck it. Yeah. No, it's so true.

Andrew Muto
So I would just say try to get out of your own way and just get it completed and then evaluate it. And. And I think you'd be shocked at how much you're like, oh, that wasn't that tough. I could just power through these.

Charlie Deist
Right, Right. Yep. No, for sure. There was a tweet from naval last week. It was funny because somebody screenshotted. He must have had some sort of social media scheduling glitch where he sent out the same tweet three times in one day. And it's probably one of these things that he just recycles every month or so. But for whatever reason, it got in the queue for three times in a day. And the tweet was like the. You know, the less you care about your writing, the better it is or something like that. And each time it gets like a million retweets or. But there is something to that. Just like, you know, when you. When you. The more. In a way, there's diminishing returns. That's one way to put it.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. I mean, I think the psychology of creation, like, you can start to just. It just prevents you from actually finishing it. And I would say just jump in mindlessly and keep it mindless.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
And just. Just make it just. Get it edited. And given that like short form, that's harder to do in long form, because long form, you're working on it for a long time, so you start to evaluate it. But in short form, you can make a 15 to 25 second video in under five minutes.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
And it's like that's, that's the headspace. And then you could become, because I think almost everybody is a better editor than they are a blank page creator. Blank page creation is tough as. But, but when you're looking at something that's already completed, you can have a lot of nickel and dime comments and be like, oh, I know how to make this better. I'm going to cut this, I'm going to cut that. Any non creative person is a good editor, never mind creative people. So get it down. It's like what people say about first drafts of, of like novels or scripts or whatever. Just get the first draft out, it's going to suck. And then you'll be able to edit it much more successfully because it's complete.

Charlie Deist
Right, Right. Yeah. While I'm on YouTube here, last two podcast episodes. Well, this one just, just came out today. The content here, I mean, I don't know, look at, just looking at these thumbnails here on the screen. Is there anything, any feedback you might have? This one was about the, the teacher who kind of. The title was what to do when your students don't respect you or when you've lost control of the classroom was another idea there. And again, I'm not doing like a knee jerk. Oh, these videos aren't getting views. I mean this one again, we literally just published it. This one we published last week, 4th of July, who knows at the time, whatever. But. And I can click in if you want to see it a little bigger.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, I think my initial reaction to it and dude, this is a great example we just talked about of like once you get it down, it's much easier to like edit and revise than it is to be like, how should I do it the first time? My initial reaction to this is that it, like if you just wanted to make the dream thumbnail of if your kid hates school, watch this. You'd almost want to see an image of like an upset kid.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
You know, and then maybe this guy and a hand that isn't. It could be your hand. Right. Pointing at like this one tip or something.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. You know, some more elements. Some, some more elements in that.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, I would, I would play for shock value. Like, I would play for like, you know what, what is going to get the click. And if you, if that, if either of these people were incredibly famous, then this style of thumbnail would probably work better, where it's like, oh, that's George Clooney. I'm going to watch that.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
But given that they are just faces, you know, what then can we get out of a random person's face?

Charlie Deist
Right?

Andrew Muto
And like, you know, for the teacher one, theoretically, if you had a woman, not her, like with the crazy kids, you know, upset, upset, crying as a teacher in class or something like that, you know, like kid throwing, you know, a paper ball at her, everybody pointing at her.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
You know, something that's really over the top. Like, what is the most extreme version of that title?

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
Is it a direction that I would go with something like that?

Charlie Deist
Right. I think this is one of the things that I had my. My VA do some. Like, I don't know if this style is really working. The kind of.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, the hand drawn style. I mean, that's.

Charlie Deist
This one I thought was just too low contrast. You can't really, like, especially from far out, you have no idea what's going on in this image.

Andrew Muto
Yeah.

Charlie Deist
So like the black.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, but. But you know what? I think that layout, like, as a storyboard, that's probably exactly right. If you modernize that with stock footage, stock stock photos, like, I'm sure you can find an adult man or woman being like, oh, my God. And then you could have rambunctious kids and just photoshop those two things together.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, okay.

Andrew Muto
I would bet that that would work a lot better.

Charlie Deist
Okay.

Andrew Muto
And then, you know, we could also go back and forth about they ate me for lunch. It could be. There might be a simpler version of like, they hate me.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. Fewer words. Simpler. More charged.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, Something. Yeah, Just like, how can you dial that to 11 is kind of. You know, every time a video doesn't work, I always think to myself, how could I have dialed that up? And often, just like this exercise of when I look back through my studio, my YouTube studio, and I see videos that didn't perform and I'm like, yeah, no shit, I should revise that. That thumbnail. And I think YouTube best practice says that you can revise a title and thumbnail later, even months later, and potentially restart it. Potentially. Like, it kind of like, oh, it gets served again. And like, now it's working.

Charlie Deist
Uh huh, uh huh.

Andrew Muto
I like, I hear that story all the time.

Charlie Deist
I kind of like this idea of, you know, dial it up a level as a. As a prompting technique too. You might have seen a while back, there was a trend where people would say, like, you know, bake this potato. Like, give me an image of a baked potato. Like, okay, now bake it more. Now bake it more. Until it's just like this shriveled, you know, patch of dust. And I can kind of imagine trying something similar with like, okay, so yeah, this is. This is the cho. This is a different episode. This is actually going Back to Corey DeAngelis, who I still haven't posted yet, but how to fix American education. One simple step. If we just say like, like, this is the one I like best. But dial this up a level and see, you know? And how many times can we do this before it just becomes completely absurd? Yeah.

Andrew Muto
Have you ever experimented with Dall? E making the thumbnail for you?

Charlie Deist
Not a little bit. A little bit?

Andrew Muto
Because that might. I mean, given how deep you are in AI, I'm sure you'd be super successful in that. But, like, the. That AI look of, like, almost Pixar. Ish photorealism, you know? I'm sure you're familiar with that kind of, like, style, Right? That's not unsuccessful on YouTube. Right. Like, I may have aesthetics. Aesthetic qualms with it, but like on YouTube, it does work. So you might be able to get Dall e to create you something that you can publish, right, based on a prompt that you generate.

Charlie Deist
Dial it up even further. American education is broken. But some. But sometimes it just, it really does kind of go off the rails into just nonsense or things that I don't know. Dial it up one more time. Dial it up. If at first you don't succeed, dial it up again. Let's see, there is one episode I wanted to focus on because this is, I think maybe the next one that's going to come out. And we haven't. We looked at it a little bit together at the beginning, but then I had some thoughts. I like what I've got for this one. I don't actually have the. The video assets prepped yet, but just thinking of title thumbnail combinations. This one, it was the. It was like a TedX motivational speaker. He does, you know, he's. And the reason he was on our podcast is that he met our company's founder and the founder convinced him to basically just pull his kids out of school and do things with them that were far more educational than school ever was. So, like, the story is he skipped school for 100 days. They went to the Grand Canyon. His kids overheard him doing, you know, taking business calls in the, in the car. And then they started their own businesses and stuff like that. So, you know, something like his kids. His kids skipped school for 100 days. Here's what happened.

Andrew Muto
So that's a cool title. That's a cool title.

Charlie Deist
Any, Any suggestions or potential improvements there?

Andrew Muto
Well, that's pretty good. I mean, if you've got the video to support that, that's a pretty damn good title.

Charlie Deist
Okay.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, I would try to thumbnail that. I mean, it's tough with podcast clips because I saw this video recently that really described the psychology behind a thumbnail, that in the most perfect ideal space, you would have the most click baitable title of all time. And the thumbnail would represent essentially what the audience sees as soon as they click the video. Right. And you're like, oh. And that, that doesn't just speak to like, oh, my thumbnail needs to come from the first frame of video. It's like, how should I start the video? Right, that the video starts in that crazy moment and then kind of flashes back or whatever, but kind of sets up kind of like this is what you're about to watch.

Charlie Deist
Right, right, right.

Andrew Muto
And. And with podcasts, it's a little odder because it's like you're talking about concepts, but essentially everybody's kind of sitting at a desk or microphone. And so theoretically, you're constrained. Unless it's so obviously a aesthetic recreation of what you're talking about that it's like. Oh, that doesn't bother me.

Charlie Deist
Right, so.

Andrew Muto
So you can go in that direction of like, it's actually kind of like a symbolic representation of what you're talking about. Or it is reality, theoretically. Or it could be them in a podcast. And it's like the biggest moment, like big face, big like whatever.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. Yeah. I think, I think this kind of comes back to like the cold open sequence and sort of like the Colin and Samir, their style of doing it, where you get launched right into the action, it sets up the tension without resolving it, that kind of thing. And so here. And again, this might be in. We might be able to watch him actually say some of this, but I don't think it's been edited in yet. Let me just see what's in here. Because it's a good story. The tricky thing. No, so actually originally I had found this one clip and it's not good. It's not dynamic at all. We can watch it. But I just remember your freedom reminds people of their lack thereof. The truth is all about what? Let's just. Do you have sound?

Andrew Muto
I don't know.

Charlie Deist
Okay, let me see the bing, bada boom. Freedom reminds people of their lack thereof. And the truth is, is that all the feedback that we were sort of getting when we were like putting our toe in the water with like letting them know what was going on, the deep part of it, it was all a response. Because if this was a better pathway than that would remind them. Yeah, I mean, it's like, what? What the heck are you talking about? I have no idea what you're talking about here.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, and he's kind of low energy too, which is.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. Yeah. Funny for a motivational speaker, I assume elsewhere he kind of comes out of his shell a little bit more.

Andrew Muto
But what about the host? Is there like in Colin and Samir, there's a bit of back and forth in the cold open, you know, of like, you did what? And he's like, yeah, you know, like maybe, maybe just a rapid fire phrase. Phrase for, you know, like maybe that would be a way of cold opening in a fun way. I'm not sure what this content looks like.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, well, and actually there is something here. And I could probably find the timestamp for this exact thing at 12, 25, 30 to 27. So let me see. Because there is a back and forth where. And I thought for the thumbnail text, if this is. He's, you know, his kids skipped school for 100 days. I thought the thumbnail text could be something like, is that even allowed? Because the resolution is like. And that's in the transcript. The host says, I remember your first question was, is that allowed? And then he says. I'm like, is this dude serious? Then I'm like, it's because he's white and I'm black. I can't do that. I'm going to jail. I want to know what's going on. So that.

Andrew Muto
Let's say those are great little clips.

Charlie Deist
I mean, yeah, um, let's see what's going on. Or I can find it. Oh, I'm in the wrong composition. 2527. Somewhere around here. Okay. It took me a long time to rewire my nervous system where I felt normal. Hold on a little. A little lower. Just pull them out for a couple weeks. I remember. So Matt says, I remember your first question was, is that allowed? Right, Right. I'm like, is this dude serious? And then I'm like, it's because he's white and I'm black. I can't do. I'm going to jail. Like I don't know what's going on. And. And then there's.

Andrew Muto
That's pretty good. That moment right there is pretty good. I'm sure you might be able to even cut it up even more like.

Charlie Deist
Right, right.

Andrew Muto
But that's a good. What are they talking about? What can you not do because of race? Like, there's a lot of interesting bits there.

Charlie Deist
Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah. Because this is, this, this is the earlier setup. And I don't know where he actually mentions the hundred days, but pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures and see how they go. And I'm like, this dude is trying to get my kids expelled.

Andrew Muto
That, that line right there is great.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
Right. Like you can do the Colin and Samir, a bunch of nonsensical stuff strung together. Like I gotta watch this episode.

Charlie Deist
Right, right, right. Yeah.

Andrew Muto
And this, this dude is trying to get my kids expelled is a. Is potentially another good sub headline and. Or God, I mean, maybe even title. Like maybe there's a combination of those things. Like.

Charlie Deist
Right, right.

Andrew Muto
There's something about that line and the way he delivers it is. Is with energy. So that's great.

Charlie Deist
Right. And there's also an opportunity that I want to pull this as a long clip. So I've got the instructions here for, for my VA to cut a long. This. And I had this, you know, the schooling option most parents don't know exists. I don't know. But maybe instead it could be something like that. You know, this dude's trying to get my. This dude's trying to get my kids expelled. Or something like that.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. And then, or even, you know, maybe my kids got expelled and if there's no quote. Right. And that's. It's not true. So that, that might be unsatisfying, but like I would wonder like how far you can push something like that.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. Yeah. In this episode we'd also talked about sort of just leaning into his, his core message, which is about sort of high performance. And I think I didn't really see a delivery on this one of high performance is about this one thing. Or, like, level up in 90 days with this one tip. But he did have a good one on, like, why, you know, I gave it this title why Most People Can't Influence Anyone. And it starts off with, if you're going to communicate. Communicate. You better do it like you're called to, you know, basically, like, talking about what. What it takes to influence a crowd when you're speaking in front of them. Something like that.

Andrew Muto
That line right there, you've got to be like a thermostat and not a thermometer. Is an interesting line.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, that.

Andrew Muto
Theoretically, that. That. No, theoretically, that sounds like it could be a great clip. Oh, you already have that as a title. Cool. It might be complicated as a title, but it's an. It's an interesting opening because, like, you're like, what the fuck do you mean by that?

Charlie Deist
Right, right. Well, considering, you know, like, let's just. If we were trying to use this line and this line together, which one would be a better thumbnail? Which one would be a better title?

Andrew Muto
Why Most People Can't Influence Anyone is probably. Probably a better title. Or the number one reason People can't influence anyone.

Charlie Deist
Right. Maybe most, maybe not.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, I'm not sure about.

Charlie Deist
I'll figure something out with that. Okay. Yeah, that's. That's good. And then I. I haven't quite figured out how I would shorten the. The short clips for this, but I think I want to do at least one for his kids skipped 100 days of school. And then.

Andrew Muto
That's a great. That's a great title. I mean, that. That I would do is. Even if you have a long version, I would do a short version of that too.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. And so for this one, we're thinking on screen text, they missed over 100 days of school. Is school actually optional? Let's see. I mean, this is. This is the clip they missed over 100 days of school. Something crazy. Still had good grades, and we're still student council leaders. Still worked out perfectly fine because they'd be messing around half the time in school anyways. And you could just catch up.

Andrew Muto
You might be able to. So let's say the title was his kids missed 100 days of school. Then you could have his face on the thumbnail. And then it's like just the word.

Charlie Deist
This is for the long. This is for the long clip.

Andrew Muto
Either. Either one, honestly. And. And you could. The text, it could just say crazy next to it.

Charlie Deist
Right, right, right, right.

Andrew Muto
Like, because I think most people would go into that video thinking, yeah, this is going to be a takedown of this guy, and then the guy's going to explain himself and how well it's working, I'm sure.

Charlie Deist
Like, wait a minute. Sorry.

Andrew Muto
Can you hear me?

Charlie Deist
Yeah, I can hear you. Right. For some reason I I down. Put my audio down until it muted for about a split second, but then.

Andrew Muto
No, no. So. So I'm thinking, like, if you put crazy next to his face, it's gonna play into people who read that title. Like, this isn't this. That's an insane idea.

Charlie Deist
We're talking on a thumbnail or we're talking. Working on a, on a, on a clip.

Andrew Muto
I'm talking about a thumbnail.

Charlie Deist
Oh, like, okay, right, yeah, yeah.

Andrew Muto
That you'd have title his kid skipped 100 days of school. And then you know, his face and the word that says crazy right next to it.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
And I think that would play into like people. What people want out of that video theoretically is like a takedown of this kid, this guy up and.

Charlie Deist
Right, right.

Andrew Muto
You know, but it turns out he didn't fuck up. He had a great experience with his kids, the whole thing. And it's like that's. That probably summarizes a pretty, a pretty satisfying video.

Charlie Deist
Right, Right. Yeah, for sure. Before the clip, I'm just thinking through on screen text for this if it's needed. I mean he starts off right. The first thing he says in this

Andrew Muto
one you're talking as like a, as like a portrait, short form piece of content.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, as a, as a, short, as a real. Like they missed over a hundred days of school or something crazy. He says that at the very beginning. So I'm not inclined to necessarily repeat that in like that could even be. I could, I could have this. Well, unless if I do two or three words per caption, then I wouldn't do that.

Andrew Muto
But you could even like with something that starts that hot of like the guy is saying essentially what you'd put on screen. Right. Then you can just do a reaction from like the creator's point of view or your point of view. Like for instance, today I. My on screen text was just what question mark and what W h u t kind of like mind blown. And it's like, okay, so I guess it's indicating to me that something very odd is happening in this video. And by frame one, you see what is going on. It's like, okay, this is weird. I can't. I'm going to watch the rest of this. And same with yours where it's like they missed over 100 days of school and it's just like what maybe even like the eyeballs emoji, you know, of like what. What is going on here? And so it's just kind of compelling the audience of like, I better watch this. To see it's a similar tactic to the ending is crazy, you know, Like, I guess I'm gonna watch this because the creator of this video is indicating something. This is wild, right?

Charlie Deist
Right. Yeah. Okay.

Andrew Muto
I use that, I use that tactic all the time. Like when I have like a pretty girl video and I don't really have anything to say about it. I'll just use like a. Wow.

Charlie Deist
Right. Right. And if I were to do this, would I need to. I guess there's a. You could, like, you can upload a thumbnail that's different from any of the frames in the video, right?

Andrew Muto
Yeah. I mean, I was. When I was on a thumbnail before, I thought maybe you wanted to make a short version for YouTube. So I got. I got caught in that. That if you were going to make, like a th.

Charlie Deist
I do, I do. I want to do both for this episode. I think that this is probably going to be the title of the main episode. It's probably also going to be some variation of. This is going to be a long clip, five minute. Six minute clip and then I also want to do a short and then for the, the thumbnail of that short, usually what I do is I just have some on screen text in the first few seconds and I select one of those early frames as the thumbnail. But if I'm doing something like what? Or you know, I guess I could just have that be a frame in the early part of the video or I could create a separate image and upload that as the thumbnail.

Andrew Muto
Got it. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't. For YouTube, that's where thumbnails matter the most. On Instagram and TikTok, generally speaking, the whole people get served your thing.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
On YouTube, you often see shorts inside of your search feed, right. That like on your homepage there's like the traditional TV ones and then there's a bunch of portrait ones. That's where a thumbnail really matters for a short form video. But yeah, what I do often is I very rarely on YouTube shorts, upload my own image of thumbnail. I will find the frame and then if I already have text there, I'll just write text in the YouTube app and blow it up to cover the text. Okay, so let's say I've got transcription down there. I would just write like, wow, and just scale it up to cover my text.

Charlie Deist
I see.

Andrew Muto
And that almost always works.

Charlie Deist
And do you download the video? Wait, no.

Andrew Muto
You could do that right in the YouTube app. Like right in the YouTube. Yeah, yeah, right in the YouTube app. Like when you're, when you're uploading a short.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, well, when you upload the short, are you uploading like an edited short that you've already posted on Instagram or are you uploading?

Andrew Muto
Okay, no, always, always the same thing from Instagram and it doesn't

Charlie Deist
have like the watermark on it or.

Andrew Muto
Well, because I've, I've created a master version in Adobe Premiere the same way you do in descript. Right. That like I have a, a official version sitting in my camera roll and I just upload that to everywhere.

Charlie Deist
Got it. And you do the caption. You do captions and almost all the creative elements in Premiere.

Andrew Muto
Yes, 99% of the time, every once in a while there's something that I want to try to maybe give the algo a little bit more of the understanding of what's it about. So I'll add a little caption here or there. Very rare though for me to do that.

Charlie Deist
Okay. Okay. Well, I think I'm just about at my limit. This week has just been not a bad week? Just exhausting.

Andrew Muto
Are you still. Are you, like, on vacation? I'm sorry.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. Yeah. I've got another week where I'd say I'm like, I'm able. I can phone it in for another week. And then I need to start to start to figure out what my balance is going to be for the rest of the quarter. I'm thinking about. I don't know, there's even a possibility of trying to. Trying to become like a fractional independent contractor for Open Ed, but still working at close to my current salary or at my current salary, but. But being like officially two thirds time or something, just because. Because I'm looking at everything going on and I'm like, I don't think that I can show up on slack at the, you know, I don't, I don't know that I want to be on the hook for everything that I have been. Yeah, yeah, it's all good. And this is, this continues to be sort of one of the highlights, both just from a skill building perspective and leveling up, and also makes me think that I can hit my marks. Like, I can hit my KPIs without putting in, you know, eight hour work days if I'm smart about how I use that time.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, for sure, for sure. Well, I mean, I, if I were you, I would try to use some of this kind of like, slower downtime period to experiment leisurely. Right. Like try to record a talking head for just a few seconds, put it into the Instagram edits. Try that restyle. Just see, see what it feels like to make some of this content as a prototype.

Charlie Deist
Right, right.

Andrew Muto
So that you can come back a week, you know, like, like when you're kind of back on.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
And have some prototypes. Like, all right, I'm gonna execute on these. Or I've discovered that these are horrible. They're too hard to make, whatever it is.

Charlie Deist
Yep. Yeah, sounds good. You gave me some good ideas. The, the recording on the phone and then all this stuff, as always, is. Is good on the podcast front.

Andrew Muto
So I feel pumped up about this one.

Charlie Deist
I'm gonna do a little more on the cold intro for this episode and start to prep it for next week.

Andrew Muto
Cool. On, on Tuesday when we meet again, do you want to. Do you want to plan on having like one of those Instagram edit restyled AI videos ready or.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. Hold me accountable for that.

Andrew Muto
Okay. Because I mean, it really should be easy. It really should take less than 10 minutes.

Charlie Deist
I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to do it right now.

Andrew Muto
Just try to. I would say try to bang one out and see what you know. You're instantly going to realize whether or not it's even doable.

Charlie Deist
Right. Right.

Andrew Muto
So cool. I think that'd be a. That'd be a good plan.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. Well, the only thing I'm trying to remember now is when I made that horse video, and I think I either texted it or emailed it to you. Let me see if I texted it to you. Wait a minute. No, I must have emailed it to you, so I'll check my email and see because I remember, I think that I typed something and got the horse from typing it rather than speaking it. But maybe I spoke it, and, like, I spoke.

Andrew Muto
I heard one where you spoke and you used a voice. You did. Like a thing.

Charlie Deist
That was. That was, I think, from. Hey, Jen. Oh, let me see. Style, cap cut. Oh, wait, no, it was cap cut. It was cap cut.

Andrew Muto
Oh, interesting.

Charlie Deist
Is that a TikTok? No. Yeah.

Andrew Muto
Owned by. Yeah.

Charlie Deist
Okay. Okay. So this is what I made in Capcut. Hello, I'm Ed. I'm a talking horse. Isn't that rather odd? But I'll try the. I'm a talking horse. I'll try the Instagram one, too, and just see which one of these. Feels better.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. And. And with Instagram, I think what it's going to rely on is, like, your video.

Charlie Deist
Like, you're gonna have to do the action. Well, that could be good. That could be good. I might still be able to pull off the. The skits involving. We'll see. I got some ideas.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, very cool, man. I'll talk to you on Tuesday then.

Charlie Deist
All right, talk to you then. Thanks, Andrew.

Andrew Muto
You got it. Bye. Bye.

July 18 (1)

Charlie Deist
Hey, what's up, Andrew?

Andrew Muto
Hey, Charlie. How are you, man?

Charlie Deist
Good. Let me shut off my music here. I found this. Do you listen to music while you do, like, focus work? Like, any kind of. Are you. More of you're doing more sound stuff so you interferes during writing?

Andrew Muto
Whenever I'm writing or working on, like, PowerPoint presentations, I generally do if I'm listening to dialogue. It's. It's very tough. Okay. But I'm. What I always have in the background is. I'm ashamed to Admit I have YouTube videos going, like, non stop. Right? Yeah. And I. It's. It's just like a combination of camera stuff, and then I've fallen down some weird rabbit hole of, like, police cam, body cam videos. I find them fascinating. And I just get served this all day and it's just like, on. And I'll pause it while I'm editing vo, and then as soon as I'm done with the vo, it starts up again and I'm editing the graphics or whatever.

Charlie Deist
Nice. Yeah. I go back and forth between, like, I don't know, the binaural beats the, like, 600 or whatever special frequency. But I found this one recently that it's kind of a throwback. There was a Bradley Cooper movie that I don't think it actually got that much attention when it came out, but. Did you ever see Limitless?

Andrew Muto
Oh, sure, yeah.

Charlie Deist
Maybe it was a bigger deal than. But I liked it. And then this. This video is like. It's called Rewrite youe Story, Limitless Productivity Playlist. And it kind of like opens with a little bit of, like, that setting the stage. He's like the loser version of himself. And I don't watch the video part of it, but it gets me in a good zone to be like, okay, let's get shit done.

Andrew Muto
There's a whole subculture of kind of like biohacker types from Silicon Valley that try to like that. That's called NZ17 or something like that. The drug that he takes. Like, I guess there are, like, nootropic kind of like, similarities that are available. And I think someone said that. What is. It's not Ritalin. What's the one that people take now?

Charlie Deist
Modafinil. Paracetam.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, even. Even for adhd. What am I.

Charlie Deist
Oh, Ritalin. No, no, no.

Andrew Muto
What's the other one?

Charlie Deist
Well, Ritalin and Adderall are the ones.

Andrew Muto
Adderall. Adderall. But Adderall is actually apparently a very close similarity to, like, the effects. Like, obviously it's not giving people superpowers but it was interesting. I went down a rabbit hole years ago, but like, how possible is this?

Charlie Deist
No, I find it relatable, having only taken Adderall a handful of times in college to get through finals. I remember one time I had been studying for stats or econ. Maybe I did. I experienced this twice, actually, with two different sets of finals, and in each case I was cramming for some kind of quantitative thing and then I would. When I came out of that mode, the whole next day, I was seeing the, like, patterns from econ in everything, like license plates and stuff. I felt like, wow, if this were turned up a little bit, I could, like, fall off into paranoid schizophrenic.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, yeah.

Charlie Deist
Thankfully, I never took the habit that far, and now coffee is good enough for me.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, Coffee is just my baseline these days. Like, I'm very clearly, you know, reliant on it. There was an interesting podcast I listened to that I think was based off a book, but the idea that the age of enlightenment is directly tied to the introduction of coffee into humans.

Charlie Deist
Right. And that, like Michael Pollan.

Andrew Muto
Or it might. It might be. It might be. It was a Tim Ferriss episode.

Charlie Deist
I bet it was Michael Pollan, because those guys are buddies.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. And that's always stuck with me, that caffeine is, like, a core component to modern human existence. And you. Oh, it's just doesn't behoove us to subtract it.

Charlie Deist
Right, right.

Andrew Muto
Like, there seems to be no real downsides. And it's like, fuck it, I'll just, you know, augment my psychology with caffeine for the rest of my life. I guess.

Charlie Deist
Truly, I could. It makes me think I should actually revisit this. I used to write on medium. I can't even find my account right now. I don't know. Did they take it down? This is the problem with the Internet now. It's like, stuff that you thought would live forever sure disappears. But before. Before Michael Pollan wrote his book, I made that same argument and wrote one of my. It's actually one of my favorite things I wrote. I did a whole series on caffeine, and at the time, I was struggling with it more. Now I'm at peace with my relationship with coffee. I believe that it is a vitamin and it has very little downside. So I'm all about it.

Andrew Muto
Very cool. Maybe before we get started, I was looking at your Instagram and TikTok and the recent horse one that you just posted. So on TikTok, it's doing, you know, marginally better than some of the other stuff, which I think is a good sign on Instagram. It's just standard. I think in both cases, there's not enough context for the algo to understand what this is even about. Like, there's not. Like, there isn't a lot written into the description. Right. Like, groundbreaking study out of Harvard. I would jam pack that with a little bit more SEO, especially on Instagram.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. Just like you know, you probably can't do too much, but, like, a paragraph or two about homeschooling, children learning, you know, all the stuff. So the algo has a good chance to understand what this could be.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
And over time, I think it starts to associate your account with these things. Yeah, but it struck me that, like, I'm not sure the algo would really. I mean, it could read the. Voiceover and it should be able to do okay there, but I would say try to play into that a little bit more.

Charlie Deist
Okay, good deal. It's funny because I, I'm looking and it actually did above average on YouTube also. And I posted it the platform that are the tool that I use to schedule. I can do different captions for different platforms. And I did a longer caption for some of the other platforms. Not Instagram or TikTok, but like on LinkedIn, there's a longer post. So you think I, you know, I should just beef that up a little bit?

Andrew Muto
Yeah, I mean, just let it. The, the description is like another real signal to the algo. Like, what is that? What are they even talking about?

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
And if you can give it context there, that's just in your. To your benefit. And same with hashtags that like, you know, whether hashtags have been deprecated or not, clearly they're still in the mix. And so I would include hashtags in that of hashtag, homeschool, hashtag, you know, teaching or learning strategies, stuff like that.

Charlie Deist
Okay.

Andrew Muto
And you'll see. I, I don't know what it's like in your scheduling, but at least in the app, when you start a hashtag, it'll give you the scale of the hashtag as you're writing it. It'll suggest it and then tell you, like, how many reels it's been used in. And that's really helpful because you can start to make decisions about. If I go for a hashtag like photography, that's like, that's everybody. It's almost not helpful. But something like Street Portrait, which is closer to 2 million, it's like, okay, so that's a big enough like, audience, but also not astronomical, where I would just not be considered. So you're right.

Charlie Deist
Kind of like SEO. Just like SEO.

Andrew Muto
Yeah.

Charlie Deist
It's exactly not going to rank in the.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. So you're trying to find these sweet spots of like, you know, one of the ones that works really well for me is this concept of street style. And that's something where, like, that's. It's right under a million or right around a million. And it's like, cool, I can use that and really, you know, stick out.

Charlie Deist
Right, Right. Okay.

Andrew Muto
So I would just, I would make sure that's also part of your daily posting strategy, hashtags and description.

Charlie Deist
And so I'll have to do that in the platform, though, or in the.

Andrew Muto
I don't think you have to. If you do it in the plat if you do in the app, you'll get, you'll get insights. I don't know what platform you're. What platform to use to post post Planner.

Charlie Deist
It's like Buffer.

Andrew Muto
Got it. Yeah. I don't know if I can't remember. I used to use Buffer. I can't remember if those would give you the same insights that, like, it autocompletes a hashtag and gives you the stats of it. But if you do it in the app at least one time, you'll get a sense.

Charlie Deist
Okay. You know. Right. Then I can just, like, make my folder.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. Yeah. You could start to get a sense of, like, I'm going to include a handful of these each time.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
I mean, I probably use, like, 12 every post, which I think everybody will tell you is overkill, but. But I have tried not using them and the post doesn't do well, so I'm a little superstitious at a minimum.

Charlie Deist
Okay, got it. Well, I've got another. I've got one to show you that I just kind of whipped up pretty. Pretty last minute. The concept came to me just from like a newsletter segment today. And it sort of plays off of the, you know, the, like, hard times create Tough men. Tough men created.

Andrew Muto
Sure.

Charlie Deist
That thing. So there's this woman who in the podcast was talking about, you know, how kind of hard times create, like, capable pairings. Well, I'll just, I'll show you the video here. But. But I also tried. I'm trying the original Ed, the horse mascot image. And I've been trying to get the green screen effect to work into script because I want to be able to, you know, layer more stuff in the end, do it like, kind of in the style that people do with like, yeah, green screen over headline or whatever it might be. And in this case. Well, I'll just show you again, not final draft quality here. And you'll see immediately, very obviously, that the green screen didn't quite work. Like, this was the. This was the clip. I actually just uploaded the image like with literal green. In case that's how the green screen thing works. I wonder. Like, I mean, I would assume Adobe Premiere has a pretty good green screen.

Andrew Muto
You know, I don't think I've ever used it. Adobe in my use, Adobe Premiere is coordinates with Adobe After Effects. So, like, if I ever have like a motion graphic thing to do, like a green screen, there's a way of just kicking whatever you're working on over to After Effects work over there and over there. It has a really robust green screen.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
But I have never used it the way I see it used in kind of like phone apps where it's like, it's basically, you know, it's a mat around, you know, whether something is moving or not. So it can identify people really easily and it just erases the background. I've never used that in Premiere.

Charlie Deist
Somehow it's like not quite getting the horse's ears, maybe. Because it is. I think it is probably looking for like a person.

Andrew Muto
Yeah.

Charlie Deist
Human face. But yeah, pretty. Pretty simple here. Let's see if I turned on the audio.

Andrew Muto
I don't hear audio.

Charlie Deist
No. Okay, hold on. I went back to the British, the regular British. I think this was the same British accent as the original one. It might be a younger voice here. Hard times create capable parents. Also ignore this double caption I meant to generate it without a caption, but it got it.

Andrew Muto
Okay. Hard times create capable parents. Capable parents create easy childhoods. Easy childhoods create anxious adults. And anxious adults create hard times. Yeah. I mean. Yeah, I. I think. I. I think that the magic with this. Is when the lip sync works really well. It's hard for me to tell on the screen based on the frame rates, whether or not parents create easy childhoods.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. Let's compare that to this original one. Life in other. Harvard just confirmed that doing chores helps kids later in life. In other news, hay is food and water is wet.

Andrew Muto
Let me see. Brilliant.

Charlie Deist
Oh, whoops. Am I sure I'm sharing my full screen, Right? Yeah, you're just looking at. On yours. Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

Andrew Muto
Well, you know, the, the trouble with the horse is that, you know, it could, it could look like chewing, you know, and it's like it really is the mouth shape that, you know, that you're hoping to nail. But when it works really well, it works really well.

Charlie Deist
I might try just different. And I bought the Pipit Monthly subscription so I can play around more with different base photos. The way this works, you just upload your file and it takes a long time for it to load. But like, you just upload your picture, then you write the script, you assign the voice. But like, if I found a different. I mean, I wonder how many stock photos like this there are where maybe where there's a little bit more like definition around the lips or something. Or I could even take off the glasses and put the glasses on myself later. But like. Yeah, I'll play around with that a little bit more. I won't take. Take time. Too much time. Now, this one is kind of funny.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. Mr. Ed is probably. I mean, that's a pretty good example of how it's been done in the past. But it was just.

Charlie Deist
I can. Yeah. I think that the fact that it shows the teeth might kind of. Might make it a little bit. Let's just try. I want one that's a little bit higher resolution. This one maybe. Is it still loading? Let's try this one. And it's going to take a while, but we can, we can move on to something else. And then in five, five or ten minutes we can look at it again. Pip it.

Andrew Muto
And are you, are you like a hundred percent tied to the horse thing? Like, is there a world where you would try something else?

Charlie Deist
What else, what else might we consider? Like, give me an example of.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, I saw the Mona Lisa stuff in there, so historical stuff. Right. That you can kind of get away with. Right. It could be Albert Einstein or, or even like the David sculpture, you know, that you could.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
I know that the Edits app has that sculpture feature. Right. So just something that feels a little more high route. That's one. One that comes to mind is that aliens commenting on human culture is interesting and gives you an angle. Right. Like, not just the way they look, but the way that they could talk about a society that, like, hasn't quite figured it out yet. But you could be in the world of. You're figuring it out. Right. Like, you're the ones who are acting the way that they would expect humans to act in a positive way.

Charlie Deist
No, I like that.

Andrew Muto
I like that aliens could be fun and, and then, you know, theoretically you could own it. Right. Like, you could, you know, whether you have chat GPT help build you, like a illustrated alien or something, or even a photoreal alien, it becomes something that you can kind of control and own, which is super cool.

Charlie Deist
I like that Albert Einstein alien statue of David. Just things that I could use as the messenger for different messages.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. You know, stuff. And, and, and maybe it's contextual. Like, you know, if somebody's talking about being smart or not being smart, you know, the. Albert Einstein is one to deliver that information. But you could also imagine Cleopatra, you know, like delivering something about aging empires or something.

Charlie Deist
Right, Right. Yeah. If it's sort of like. If it's some kind of educate. Actual educational content.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. Or, or no, just in context of, like, the American system. Right. That's where. That's where my head's going. Like, if, like, the American system is antiquated or not working, and it's like the American empire is not delivering the education it should be, you know, that could be delivered by a historical figure known for their empire building or something.

Charlie Deist
Right. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me just. I'm going to do a random caption. The caption's not the point here, but. All right. It's not going to be funny. It's not going to be clever. It's just going to be a technical test. They say I'm putting the cart before the horse. At least my cart has personalized learning plans and doesn't smell like cafeteria pizza. I want to. I want to also see if I can get rid of the captions in this platform show as captions. Seems like I should be able to if I untoggle the box that says show us captions. Well, we'll see. I'll just export it and then we'll see if it does better with the, with the, with the mouth moving. The mouth match and I'll do faster export rate frames per se. Oh, interesting. You can choose how many frames per second. I wonder. This one. I'll just try more frames per second and see what happens. Let's see what else I. I guess some. Some of your thoughts on the other videos, and I, I didn't really finish those ones or post them yet because I, I heard you on the, you know, don't make the visuals, the, the oddly satisfying visuals any longer than the captions or the voiceover. And, yeah, I think that was just. Kind of an editing glitch or I just.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, okay, got it. That. Yeah, that was my main thing of like that is really there just as another tactic to get people to keep watching. Not that they would finish. And. And there's probably good philosophy behind or psychology behind the fact that when it doesn't finish, you know, like, I see that more often than ever. Like I'll get served something of like Karen freaks out and gets arrested and in a tick tock video. And then it never even gets to the arrest.

Charlie Deist
No, it never ends. Right, right. And it's like me.

Andrew Muto
And then, you know, the comments are full of that. But the video has already taken its views and ran and it's like, interesting strategy. I'm just.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. What was that? Let me see the. Oh, right. So I mean, it's. It was up in the corner. The horse was up in the corner because I had to make room for the visual.

Andrew Muto
Yeah.

Charlie Deist
That wasn't really my, my. I think my intention would be to do it more like bottom left or you know, that's usually kind of where the talking head shows up. It seems like.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. The horse head shape is also, you know, tough. It's perfect for portrait. Right. But hard to make half a frame.

Charlie Deist
Right, right. It's very long.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. I mean, the other, like I had mentioned, I think. And did I not write back? I did.

Charlie Deist
No, I think you did. On the text you did.

Andrew Muto
But I, I thought I had written something about how I liked the English voice better than.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. Yep.

Andrew Muto
Oh, that's okay. Yeah, yeah.

Charlie Deist
As opposed to the one it was sort of ambiguously like, is it Indian? Is it Rastafarian, Is it British Indian?

Andrew Muto
It almost sounded like vaguely Ethiopian or something to me.

Charlie Deist
Right, right.

Andrew Muto
And none of those areas to an American ear strikes me as like, like sophistication. Yeah, yeah, I think that's. And I know there's like classic things about the British accent not sounding to other. To other ethnicities. The British accent does not blow people away, but to American ears it feels.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, well, I don't know. I mean, let's see. What. What should my next milestone be for? I could try some other avatars. I could try.

Andrew Muto
I think you're. I think you're on to something with this, man. I'm super jealous. I've been thinking about this for like a decade. Just like using avatars to say whatever you want and then, you know, you're, You're. You could do anything with this. And personally, I wouldn't get hung up on the horse if the horse is specifically difficult to execute on. Right. Like, the mouth shape is difficult to shape, the face is difficult. And it's like if you can win with something else, whether it is a historical painting or a, you know, an avatar, that you could create an AI, like an alien of some kind that's funny and silly looking and. Fun for everybody to look at. I think of, you know, Mike from Monsters Inc. You know, he's got one eye. You know, like, you could go crazy. You could do the classic alien thing. You could do the Simpsons. You know, they have the two guys that are always talking. You know, there's a lot of stuff that you could do, but all of a sudden, if you could do it, you could own it. And you could have these guys talk to each other, they could talk to the audience, and you would never have problems with mouth shape. It would just be. It would be a home run every time. Now it's just about the content.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, I think there's like. I think part of. I'm already. I'm skating on a little bit of thin ice because I know that our CEO is sort of like a Luddite on AI and he didn't want. But, but, but his secondhand man is all about it. And actually saw the post on. On X of the Talking horse and was like, I love this and posted it in Slack. And then that got a bunch of likes within Slack.

Andrew Muto
Oh, that's great.

Charlie Deist
Conspicuously absent from the likes was. Was Isaac, the CEO. But, you know, he fixes battles, so if liking things, he's not going to say anything.

Andrew Muto
So I mean, personally, I would chase that down, but I would also try to sort out maybe different angles of horse that would work better. One of my gut instincts is that, like, in a profile would at least give you the side angle of mouth.

Charlie Deist
Okay. Okay. Well, we might get that with. We might get that with this latest one. Let me see how the download's going. Okay. It's about. It's almost 75% done here, so we'll see in a minute whether that might be a little more viable. And then if I can figure out the caption thing and the green screen thing, that'll also maybe help. And then Mr. Ed has more recognizability among the older generation.

Andrew Muto
Sure.

Charlie Deist
I. I've never seen that show.

Andrew Muto
Or I used to watch it on like Nick at night or Nickelodeon or something like that.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, right.

Andrew Muto
The other thing that I would chase down is what we talked about before, which is short versions of somebody going like this or like this.

Charlie Deist
Oh, yeah. Okay.

Andrew Muto
And. And that could be your face in the short. Just. Just to test it. Just to do a handful of these. Right? Yeah. Maybe would like, you know, whether you want to include your kid or not. But like, you know, kid on lap or like, you know, it's just very organic. Like dad, dad saw something interesting. Okay. My wife does these all the time for her floral account, and they work like gangbusters.

Charlie Deist
And you're. What you're pointing to is really the description.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. Or the words telling you to do something. Right. Like.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
You know, the five best ways to blah, blah, blah. And then it says, like, that's what. That's the text on screen. And then in tinier font or somewhere else, it's like, you know, read the description.

Charlie Deist
Right. Okay.

Andrew Muto
I think that kind of stuff, like, that's a. I mean, that's the kind of thing you can whip up, like five of those in three minutes.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. It doesn't have to follow up with more video of, you know.

Andrew Muto
Yes. And if you can make it work with just your face, you can make it work with other people's faces. Right. The catch right now is it like very low hanging fruit. You can do it with you and then you could just as a stress test and then see if that works. You can deploy other people or AI versions or whatever, or even a combination of the horse. Right. Like you could start to understand the limits. If it works with a human but doesn't work with an animated avatar. You start to understand stuff of like, okay, so they avatar has limits.

Charlie Deist
Right. All right, that's going on my list for sure.

Andrew Muto
So and then the last thing I would say is a podcast clip that maybe already exists that didn't do good, but probably should have. Right. Like the George Washington one is maybe on that list of mine where like that's, that's well done. And if only he was more well known, he would. And pair that with one of those burning through Styrofoams.

Charlie Deist
Okay.

Andrew Muto
Right. Like one that should have done good but for some reason people didn't pay attention. What tactic can you use to get people to pay a little bit more attention?

Charlie Deist
Okay, so I've got one maybe, you know, re. Redo of the. The horse with better lip syncing. One recycled podcast with oddly satisfying. And then one pointing at text or something like that. Pointing at text or description.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, yeah. And. And the other one is. I, I know. I'm sure I would. I would. If it's easy and it would be easy. This is the way to do it. Try maybe another avatar that's built into one of these programs.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
Whether it is an animated kid that I just saw on your screen before or something in Instagram edits and the restyle feature. Yeah, just use the same script that you used with the horse and try it with that. I think that some of the magic of why people like watching these is because they feel so well done. Right. Like the, the Yeti or the Bigfoot. You're like, holy shit. Like that look, you're watching out of fascination of like that's really well done. And so there. These apps have already come to the table with the well doneness.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
So it's like, see if you could exploit that at all and you could. We could start to figure out like, is it the script or is it the. Just the horse is not working or like.

Charlie Deist
Okay, yeah, I can do that. And our next meeting is Tuesday, right?

Andrew Muto
Yeah, Tuesday. Yeah.

Charlie Deist
Okay.

Andrew Muto
The one that comes top of mind for me is the. The marble statue restyle and edits in that it feels high brow. Right. That you could have. It's going to look like it's educational adjacent, at least. It feels like Greek Roman history.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, I'll find a good. Maybe that could be the one to deliver the hard, you know, hard times. Create capable parents or something like that.

Andrew Muto
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, just. And just see if maybe you can get that to work.

Charlie Deist
All right, can do.

Andrew Muto
And that's all like really low hanging fruit stuff that I think should be not a hard lift.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. Well, our Mr. Ed is 5% away. In the meantime, I did actually have one other thing if I wanted. I occasionally host some podcasts and. And then there's also. I'm wanting to do more like screen. Screen sharing AI videos for my own personal stuff. So I got some, got some lights, not that I necessarily need them, but I got a couple of these small rigs.

Andrew Muto
Oh sure, I got them. I got. Right on my shelf over here.

Charlie Deist
Oh yeah, yeah. And I also got this backlight which maybe is right now. Let's see. I feel like Every, everyone on YouTube always has some kind of like neon something in the background. Not to just straight up imitate them, but, but if we were to, you know, if I'm trying to frame, sort of frame myself and think about things like that. I don't know if you have any special insight into that.

Andrew Muto
But yeah, I mean, I obsessed over this for like all of this that you see here. It's a shame I'm not on my iPad right now because really my set is right here. It's my computer and you know, there's probably a frame of it on YouTube. Let me see if I can just pull a frame real quick. One sec here.

Charlie Deist
And I can, you know, I rearrange anything and this, this bookshelf can go out and I could take the photos down.

Andrew Muto
Let me just drop this image into. Where's our chat?

Charlie Deist
There it is. I could add more.

Andrew Muto
Okay. So I, I, no, I just, I just added. So I built, I moved my desk into this part of my office and built that shelving system and added that tree and everything to kind of build my own background. And you're right, like I added some of those like neon lights. What I discovered was that a lot of these battery powered lights and I have other ones that I used to put on the shelf. They don't last long enough for me to get through a recording. They'll last like 20, 30, 40 minutes. But I was routinely spending a lot longer than that, just kind of tinkering. And I would realize in the middle of a recording one of the lights went out. So that was one of my core issues. And you can see in my image right here that I'm talking to you and that. That the cable here, right? Like this cable, right, Is what is powering those lights, right? But I frame it out and then I have, like, studio lights. That are on both sides of me. There's one key light that's hitting me on my screen, left side, the brighter side of my face in that image. And then there's another one further away that's giving a little bit more fill. But it's basically, it's a classic two light setup. And Phil. And you know you can tinker with this forever.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
But the idea is you. I think the benefit of this kind of setup is that it immediately adds a. It has a sniff of professionalism.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
It's that I think there's credibility built in. It's kind of my frustration with some of the podcast people where it's like, bro, there's nothing back there and you're wearing a T shirt. Like you kind of hope, you know, to his credit, who is the fucking guy? God, I'm not going to remember his name now. He, he's that Canadian professor that's always causing trouble talking about trans people. But he's. Yeah, Jordan Peterson. To his credit, he always looks like a million bucks. Right. Like, he always looks. He's always dressed the up. And so you're. You're prepared to listen to what he has to say.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
And I think in, in the universe of providing information in that genre, that's kind of what you're coming to the table with. Right. And so I think that's what's going on when you look at a screen.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
On the other hand, I would say that all of this is a time suck. That.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
Compared to I could, I could. For every one of these that are like really well done, like mine, there's like another person who just didn't give a. And they're nailing it.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
Like there's this whole subculture of something called grandpa vlogging where it's like set up a camera, talk for 55 minutes and basically edit nothing and they go to the moon, it's usually about a specific topic. Like there's this one like cattle rancher guy and he just like sets down a shitty camera and talks into it and it's like, how the fuck is this so popular? But sure enough, it is actually interesting to listen to because the guy's just got a take on a universe that I never even thought of there being takes.

Charlie Deist
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that might be. It's probably something for my 86 year old psychologist client to learn from that.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, I mean, I think there's something really to that. And so I would, I would say build something that's easy, that you can literally flick a button and not think about it again, right? And so my nervousness about anything with battery power, like, because it could die, and you're going to start to feel this ticking clock as soon as you turn it on, you're like, oh, shit, I better start recording soon. And when you're talking, you know, and. And sometimes, depending on the light placement, you might even know goes out. And you look at the footage like, holy shit, it turned out. It turned off 30 minutes into my recording. So, like, interesting, I feel. And I have the same issue. Maybe you wouldn't think it, but, like, with my screens, they can't be on a screensaver or anything, right? They can't. I have to, like. And I have to turn all the notifications off. Otherwise. Things will pop up on the screen in the middle of the recording. So, like, I try to set these monitors up. Like, they're actually like a stage.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
So it's that kind of stuff.

Charlie Deist
Yeah.

Andrew Muto
But on the other hand, you can't really miss. I would never sweat video quality as much as I would sweat audio quality. Like, audio quality is one of those things that when it's not good, people really, really notice. And when video quality is, like, not so great, people are generally fine with it. It's audio quality that will fuck people up. So I try to, like, prioritize audio quality, and there's a lot of different ways, depending on whether you want a mic in the shot or not. I actually don't really like the mic in the shot that I've got. I. I'm. I'm thinking about getting rid of it because it just does weird that I. It's like.

Charlie Deist
It's not.

Andrew Muto
I just. It's like, this is not worth the space and. Yeah. So you sound great. So I wouldn't. I wouldn't sweat yours. And you're pretty far away from it. Mine, I have to be really close, and it's a little too bassy, and I don't want to tinker with it. And so.

Charlie Deist
Well, I got the Mr. Ed, and I feel like it's probably even more of the. The same problem where it just looks like he's chewing. I'll show you. But I don't know if they say I'm putting the cart before the horse. I say, at least my cart has personalized learning plans and doesn't smell like cafeteria pizza.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. I mean, I think it. It just. It. It really goes back to that 1960s gag of, like, the fun with the AI these days is like, holy, that looks real. They got the yeti actually talk.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
And this feels like a gag you've already seen of, like. I know he's not talking.

Charlie Deist
Right. Right. Well, I think I've got my work cut out for me this week. Kind of kicked my ass. I had, you know, just on top of all the newborn baby stuff. Then my wife's grandma passed away on Thursday.

Andrew Muto
And I'm sorry to hear that.

Charlie Deist
It was. It was a happy death. It was not a.

Andrew Muto
Yeah, yeah.

Charlie Deist
You know, and I mean, obviously it's never. It's never a purely happy death, but there was. There were tears and there were a lot of emotions. But so I was driving up to Reno and back on Thursday, Wednesday. And then yesterday was sort of a. Not a completely lost day, but just a bit of a recovery day, so. Not to make excuses, but at least I did get that one. That one prototype out.

Andrew Muto
Yeah. No, dude, man. I mean, I. I always feel like I should be being more productive. Like, my family's out of town right now, and they left early so that I could. I can make some YouTube videos. I haven't made them yet, and it's like, you know, so, like, there's part of this game is. Is being reactive to when inspiration strikes, you know, there's gonna be days where you do show. Up at the desk and you kind of get through the day, but you didn't really make anything great and that's fine. And then there's going to be days where it's like you wake up on fire, you have this moment, you listen to some podcasts and you're inspired and you just rock and roll. And I think that's why it's important to have a set that's ready on a button click. So they're like, I'm, I'm good. I can just go right now.

Charlie Deist
That's smart. Yeah.

Andrew Muto
And that's why battery powered shit drives me crazy because like, ah, fuck, I'm. I'm 30 minutes out, I gotta charge it, I gotta say, no, no, no, no. Boom. I can hit a button and I'm good to go. Because I just, I'm on fire right now. And I think that's where any creative should be, that they can work at the, at the speed of thought. Right. That they.

Charlie Deist
Speed of.

Andrew Muto
Now it's really. Robert Rodriguez talks about this, that he got into digital editing way before it was a thing. And his thing was and visual effects.

Charlie Deist
Right. I remember, I read his biography or autobiography, many years.

Andrew Muto
The Rebel Without a Crew.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, yeah.

Andrew Muto
And so he talks about how like he, he's got some interesting videos that are kind of companions to that over the years. He used to release them on the DVDs like the 10 Minute Cooking School or something. But he, his thing was like, I want to be able to make as quickly as I can think it not I can make. And then I've got like, you know, three weeks ahead of me how it used to be. And it's like that's, that was always an inspiration to me of like, don't over complicate your tech setup because you're just going to drown. Make it as good as you possibly can without needing to worry about it. And then you could just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

Charlie Deist
Yeah, yeah, I like that. I, I need to get a couple systems and that applies also to a lot of my writing stuff. Just having my, my writing systems all geared and that was one of the things we had to transition from my preferred newsletter platform, Beehive, over to HubSpot, which is just a solace CRM first thing. And yeah, one of the, you know, with like the email templates you have when you copy and paste from another place, it doesn't format right and everything's just all screwed up. But I got in and edited the HTML such that I can do a clean copy and paste and it's like, even though that took me probably two hours to get, it'll save me more time than that and headache in. In the law. In the. You know, less friction doing that every day, you know?

Andrew Muto
Yeah. I mean, those kind of structural things. I have those moments, too, where it's like, all right, I need to figure out my lower third graphics package now, because it's gonna. I can't deal with this every video. So, like, I'm gonna do it once. It's gonna cost me two hours. And, like, that. That's normal. I would say the frustrating part is when you're being creative, but you. But you're too far away technically, from being able to act on the creativity.

Charlie Deist
Right.

Andrew Muto
And so that's what I would endeavor to try to fix. And then, you know, Stephen King talks about this too. You kind of have to always show up anyway and be okay with showing up at your desk. Desk and writing nothing. But showing up is. Is at the most important thing, right? Not getting to your desk in the morning is how you get nothing done, right? But getting to your desk and then having an idea and having it ready to act, whether it's editing or writing or filming or whatever. Like, I'm gonna go make some Velvet Alfredo videos on the street after this, and I might shoot nothing, right? Like, that happens, everyone. So I get out there, see nobody, but I'm out there. I gotta show up every weekend day, and I get what I get.

Charlie Deist
Yep. Yeah. All right, well, should we stick a pin in it until next Tuesday?

Andrew Muto
Yeah, man.

Charlie Deist
I've written down this is my to do list for next weekend. This is the only thing on there right now, so rock and roll. If I don't get this done, then, yeah, no charge. Open that extra or something.

Andrew Muto
You can do it, man. You can do it. These make them really lightweight. Don't stress anything other than, like, what does it take to. Because you could probably sweat the details on this horse thing, but it. That's not the point. The point is how can I make this crazy easy? And so if it's a, you know, if it's a sculpture character or an alien or whatever, right? Like, it should be easy. And on top of that, you can complicate it and innovate, but you want the basic to be easy, right?

Charlie Deist
Yep.

Andrew Muto
Cool. Right, dude, I'll talk to you Tuesday then.

Charlie Deist
Talk to you then.

Andrew Muto
All right, man. Good luck. Bye, Andrew. See you.
