# Text Heavy

Text: The content format titled "Text Heavy" is designed for multiple platforms including Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and X, with a posting cadence of twice a week. It involves creating master content that can be repurposed, such as trivia or thoughts for newsletters. Various sub-formats/templates include text over B-roll, handwritten notes, social media screenshots, and quiz formats.

A comparison of classrooms from 1905 to 2025 highlights the outdated educational model using Chromebooks without substantial change. The guidelines suggest focusing on relatable question posts with background images, particularly effective for engaging parents and building trust. The content emphasizes the need for strong opinions to resonate with the audience, encouraging validation and engagement through simple, relatable prompts.

1905 classroom:

- Rows of desks
- Teacher lectures at front
- Students sitting still
- One-size-fits-all approach

2025 classroom:

- Rows of desks
- Teacher lectures at front
- Students sitting still
- One-size-fits-all approach

Only difference? The Chromebooks..

Education deserves better than a 120-year-old model.

Facebook - Talk more to parents in the programs. Validate them, build trust. Keep them in our corner, sharing with friends saying, “OpenEd gets me!”

Tl;dr: Simple, strong opinions that validate and make you go “MHMMMMMM 🙌”

- **Question Posts with Background Images**: Best performing format

    - Use Post Planner's question ideas (even if tangentially related)
    - Facebook's native background image feature
    - Focus on relatable, easy-to-answer prompts
    - Example: "What's your favorite homeschool win this week?"
        - **Text**: 10-20 words maximum
