**Ela Bass**

Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ela and today I'm joined by Heather Malin. Today I'm very excited because I've heard a lot of parents ask the question, how do I help my child care about their education? How do I help my child care about the subject? And today our guest brings a really amazing combination of personal experience. She was a former K-12 teacher and researcher. So she has a really cool research background. So today we're going to dive into this question.

Heather, just to start, what is the most fascinating thing that you've learned so far about children's purpose and their interest in care?

**Heather Malin**

Yeah, so the most fascinating thing... I love doing research and getting to know about youth development. So I find a lot of it fascinating.

Sometimes we think of purpose as a binary thing—you either have it or you don't. We also assume it's connected to passion, that you must have a passion to have purpose.

Through working with young people, I've come to understand that purpose is a developmental process. For young people especially, it's about exploring who you are and who you want to be in the world.

When we work with kids, we try to instill this as a lifelong process. They shouldn't just look for one thing to be theirs forever; they should have the opportunity to try things and develop an understanding of what reflects who they are.

**Ela Bass**

That's super interesting. You've mentioned a couple of times the idea of an inner self. How do you define that?

**Heather Malin**

Good question. The inner self is about looking inward. It's taking time to reflect: Who do I want to be? What do I care about? What do I find meaningful? It's about staying connected to that, even when external things pull us away.

**Ela Bass**

I'm curious, so you mentioned that right now, and a lot of your work has been done in helping kids to explore these things. Can you talk a little bit about where do you even begin? What is too young to start? Is there too young? How do you even start this conversation of the massive question, "what is your purpose?"

**Heather Malin**

Sure. There are a few ways I think about that. My background as an art teacher informs this. I found that art making is a powerful way for young kids to explore what's meaningful to them.

That's what art really is: sharing the inner world with the outer world. When I researched children's art making, I heard kids as young as eight say, "I have my imagination in my head, and the way I get it out into the world is through drawing."

**Ela Bass**

That's quite interesting. You mentioned a couple of questions. What are some other good questions to ask?

**Heather Malin**

I want to be clear: we're not asking eight-year-olds "what is your purpose in life?" We're asking: What matters to you? Who are the people you care about? What experiences have been important to you, and why?

You can start with values. That's really asking: What kind of person do you want to be? Who do you admire and why? A lot of purpose questioning is simply asking "why."

**Ela Bass**

So one of the things that a lot of our parents are interested in is motivation, right? What are the basics and the most important parts of motivating a child to some end, to care about math, to care about language arts?

**Heather Malin**

I'll start with a caveat: for some subjects and some kids, you need a carrot. You just need a reward to get them through.

But research shows that when students connect their learning to a "beyond-the-self" goal, it's very motivating. It improves engagement and academic performance.

**Ela Bass**

I'm wondering too, how you actually get kids to care about things outside of themselves?

**Heather Malin**

This is where the "why" process comes in. It happens reliably: a young person says, "I want to make a lot of money."

When you dig deeper and ask why, you hear things like, "My parents took good care of me, and I want to be able to provide for them."

Often, underneath that desire for wealth is a wish to connect and do good in the world.

**Ela Bass**

I wonder, do you ever have the experience where in your research and practice, like where children actually don't want to find their purpose and where they push back?

**Heather Malin**

That absolutely happens. This is why we shouldn't just ask, "What is your purpose?"

I have a teenager who is more receptive now, but in her early teen years, I couldn't say the word "purpose" around her. She got so tired of hearing it and didn't want to think about it.

That's why it's important not to start by saying, "You need to identify your purpose." Instead, have conversations about what they care about.

**Ela Bass**

My last question is about boredom. So what role does boredom play in developing purpose?

**Heather Malin**

Boredom is easy to get sucked into. But the truth is, purpose can be boring.

It involves doing things that aren't always interesting. You have to develop skills and get through the parts that support your goals. So yes, it can be boring.

Sticking with the boredom is a developmental process. For teens, it's cognitive development—the prefrontal cortex regulating them to make plans, be organized, and commit to their interests over the long term.

**Ela Bass**

Very, very cool. This has been amazing. What can people look up if they want to learn more from you?

**Heather Malin**

So one of the resources I have is the Purpose Hub. I've put up a lot of resources there in terms of articles.

**Ela Bass**

Perfect. Okay, well, I hope that everybody enjoyed this episode and thank you so much, Heather, for coming on the podcast.
